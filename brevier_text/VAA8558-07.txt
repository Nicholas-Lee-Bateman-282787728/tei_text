                                    divided as to political parties, and it is probable that no
                                    election of officers ran be effected without an available
                                    arrangement between these parties, and as an immediate
                                    organization is desired; that a of four Senators, two from each
                                    political party, be selected to choose persons to be voted for
                                    to fill the various offices of the Senate, said selections to be
                                    made from the nominees of the caucuses of the two parties, made
                                    on last evening.

                                YEAS--Messrs. Allison, Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Brown, of
                                    Hamilton, Capon, Chapman, Cullen, Culver, Davis, Dunning, Dykes,

                                    Cobb, Corbin, Douglas, Downey, English, Finch, Fuller, Gaff,

                                    Newlin, Staggs, Vawter, and Williams.--25.
                                So the resolution was rejected.

                                        that they report the names of the persons to the Senate
                                        immediately, and that they shall be elected by
                                        resolution.

                        Mr. BENNETT was opposed to compromise now, after the Democrats have
                            secured to themselves the biggest share of officers.

                                    Resolved, That John H. Johnson be appointed
                                        Door-keeper, and J. S. Morgan Assistant Doorkeeper of the

                                        assistants.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        The resolution was rejected by yeas 12, nays 38
                        By direction of the PRESIDENT pro tem, [Mr. DUNNING]
                            the Senate proceeded to the sixth ballot tor Principal Door-keeper, with

                        Mr BENNETT offered the following.
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved,That the House of Representatives
                                        be informed that the Senate has convened, with the Hon.
                                        Paris C. Dunning, Senator from the county of Monroe, as
                                        President pro tem. That the Senate has
                                        elected Azariah T Whittlesy, of Vanderburg county. Principal
                                        Secretary, and Jacob S. Broadwell, of Monroe county, as
                                        Assistant Secretary, and that the Senate is now ready to
                                        proceed with the Legislative business of the session. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. COBB opposed the adoption of this resolution. He was of opinion that
                            the Senate was not organized that it was not a deliberative body,
                            strictly speaking, until the organization was perfected by the election
                            of all its officers.
                        Mr. CASON moved to amend the resolution by adding the words:
                        
                            
                                

                                    "That the Door-keeper of the last Senate be authorized to act
                                        as Door-keeper until another shall be elected."
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend the amendment by striking out the words
                            ''until another shall be elected," and inserting in lieu thereof these
                            words: "during the present session."
                        
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, this amendment was laid on the table-yeas 26,
                            nays 24.
                        
                        The amendment [Mr. Cason's] was rejected by yeas 25, nays 25
                        The question recurring on the original resolution.
                         Mr. WILLIAMS said that in a legislative experience of twenty-three
                            years, he had never witnessed'any thing of the kind.
                        Mr. HORD considered that, as the Senate bad this day decided it had no
                            officer to execute its orders and processes then, of course, we are not
                            organized.
                        Mr. BENNETT did not understand the Senate to decide that the present
                            Door-keeper-the Door-keeper of the last session-could not act till his
                            successor shall be elected and qualified.
                        Mr. ALLISON moved to reconsider the vote just taken.
                        
                        The motion was rejected upon a division of the Senate- affirmative 24,
                            negative 24.
                        
                        The resolution was rejected by yeas 23, nays 26.


                        Mr. CULLEN offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the election of Principal
                                        Door-keeper, Assistant Door-keeper and Sergeant-at-Arms be
                                        post poned until January 10,1865, at 2 o'clock P. M., and be

                        And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

                        The CLERK. The honorable John U. Pettit, from Wabash bounty, having

                            Speaker of the House of Representatives for the current session. Mr.
                            Brown, of Jackson, and Mr. Branham, of Jefferson, will conduct the
                            Speaker to the Chair.
                        This formal service having been performed-
                        The SPEAKER said:
                        GENTLEMEN: I thank you for the honor done me in
                            selecting me to preside over your deliberations. It will increase the
                            value of this mark of confidence, if, in executing the duties of this
                            office, you shall think when our duties are ended, that I have deserted
                            it. The best gratitude I can express will be in trying to deserve it. I
                            confess a conscious diffidence in entering on this office, but I am
                            encouraged in remembering that I am now charged with maintaining your
                            authority, not my own with administering the rules established by
                            yourselves to maintain the decorum, dignity and independence of debate,
                            and to give ease and certainty to legislation, and that I shall be
                            cheerfully supported by you all, from principle and feeling, in
                            conducing to these objects. This will lighten the labors of the Chair,
                            and make them cheerful; and if, as is not unlikely, my judgment shall
                            betray me into errors, I know that I shall have your charitable
                            indulgence.
                        The functions of this body, always important, assume increased
                            consequence in the midst of the sad and perilous history through which
                            we are passing, and of which history my Commonwealth has proudly acted
                            its part. This requires from us, in order to preserve its honor, greater
                            watchfulness, caution, sagacity. At this solemn threshold of our duties,
                            under the fresh obligations of our oaths of office, which bind us with
                            another tie of love and loyalty to the State, may I invoke you to
                            emulate, by wisdom and justice in council, the renown of that patriotism
                            which has warmed the hearts of all our people, still glowing with
                            unabated fire, and which has felt no sacrifice too great for love of
                            country, or the equal glory of the soldiers of the State, who have
                            willingly faced danger and sustained its honor on so many
                            battle-fields.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, Mr. Speaker, I move that that the House proceed to the
                            election of Principal Clerk.
                        The order being taken by consent,

                            qualified, entered on the duties of his office.
                    

                    
                         RULES. 
                        Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I offer the following for adoption:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the rules of the last House
                                        of Representatives be the rules of this House until
                                        otherwise ordered.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that 500 copies be printed with the State
                            Constitution; but withdrew the suggestion for
                        Mr. BRANHAM. I move to amend, so that the rules be referred to a special
                            of five, to revise and report. I desire that the rules of the former
                            House be adopted for the present, and that they be referred for
                            revision.
                        The amendment was agreed to, and so the resolution was adopted.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate be informed that
                                        the House of Representatives have convened, and that enough
                                        of members to form a quorum have answered to their names,
                                        and have proceeded to organize the House by the election of
                                        the Hon. John U. Pettit, Representative of the county of
                                        Wabash, Speaker; Cyrus T. Nixon, of Clark, Principal Clerk,
                                        and Thaddeus W. O. Braffitt, of Wayne, Assisant Clerk, and
                                        John H. Dooly, of the county of Boone, Door-keeper; and that
                                        the House is now ready to proceed with the legislative
                                        business of the session.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Speaker be authorized to
                                        appoint as many pages as he may deem necessary for the
                                        convenient transaction of the business of the House.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                         MR BANTA. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand and send up a resolution
                            which I desire to have referred to the on the Judiciary, when that shall
                            be announced:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, It is generally accredited that
                                        E. Banta, whose name appears upon the printed list, was duly
                                        elected a Representative from the county of Johnson, to the
                                        General Assembly of Indiana, but who appears here without a
                                        certificate of election, by reason of a refusal on the part
                                        of the Clerk of said county to issue the same, therefore 


                                    Resolved,  That the Judiciary be directed
                                        to inquire into the propriety of preferring impeachment
                                        against said Clerk for dereliction of duty, or administering
                                        such other punishment as the Constitution and laws
                                        demand.
                                
                            
                        

                        The preamble and resolution were adopted.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Speaker, I move that the name of Mr. Banta be called,
                            and that he be sworn in.
                        Mr. BROWN did not think the action proposed would be in accordance with
                            the rules of the House, unless Mr. Banta comes here with prima facie evidence of his election. There was no evidence
                            here that this gentleman was even voted for as representative of Johnson
                            county. There was no evidence that he was even so much as a citizen of
                            the State of Indiana. Besides, inasmuch as a resolution had been adopted
                            to refer the principal matter to the Judiciary to inquire into the
                            facts, it would be greatly out of order to make him a member of the
                            House. There was, he thought, no rule of law or common sense to justify
                            the course proposed.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair does not propose to rule on the matter as a point
                            of order.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It was not contended that Mr. Banta did not receive a
                            majority of the votes cast for Representative of Johnson county at the
                            October election; but the Clerk refused to give him a certificate.
                        Mr. DUNHAM, without pretending to be conversant with the case, took issue
                            with the gentleman on the fact of contest; and the very point of the
                            contest was, that Mr. Banta did not receive a majority of the legal
                            votes cast. The charge was distinctly and promptly made, that the report
                            that Banta received a majority was a fraud. It seemed to him highly
                            improper to adopt the motion. He advised the usual course of reference
                            to the proper . He submitted that, in all his legislative experience,
                            there was no such thing as that now proposed to be done.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB referred to the constitutional power of the House to judge of
                            the qualification of its members, and to the unreasonableness of the
                            slightest admission of the power of a Circuit Court Clerk to override
                            the constitutional provision. This was not the only case of a contest
                            for seats here. The two members from the county of Putnam had received
                            notice that their places would be contested; and there was the member
                            from Clinton, [Mr. Miller.] standing, he believed, in precisely the same
                            category with Mr. Banta; and these were admitted to seats. This power
                            which was attempted to be assumed by this Clerk was utterly
                            disorganizing. It was not proposed by any order under the pending motion
                            to decide whether Banta was properly elected or not.
                        Mr. DUNHAM would not draw on the time of the House, if gentlemen did not
                            seem to misunderstand the case. So far from conceding that Banta
                            received a majority, be most emphatically stated the contrary, and the
                            proof to that effect was abundant. But he did not give so much
                            importance to this fact, as to the duty which the House owes to itself
                            in this case. Should we take current rumor, or the bare statement of a
                            member here--however honorable and unimpeachable-to govern our decision
                            as to the rights of members end the rights of constituents. Assuredly,
                            it was not safe to tamper with and hazard the rights of members and
                            constituents. Was it not due to the people of Johnson county, that we
                            should ask tor the evidence on which this gentleman claims a seat as
                            their Representative? It was all well enough for gentlemen to talk about
                            the conduct of Clerks of the Circuit Court; but that was not the
                            question. The real question here was, what a legislative body owes to
                            itself and to its constituency. He submitted, whether a single case
                            could be found in all our legislative records where a man was sworn in
                            as a member without any evidence of his election. No man knew, as a
                            member of this House, that Banta has received so much as one vote for a
                            place here. How then, could gentlemen vote "or the order to swear him in
                            without a scintilla of evidence? It would be making a mockery  of everything like the rights of
                            constituencies and the rights of members in contested cases.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. It was unquestionably the right of the gentleman from
                            Johnson to be sworn in. It was not to be presumed that he would have
                            come in, without the sending of his constituents. But as best of all
                            authority here, he held in his hand & copy of the State Sentinel,
                            giving his name as the Representative returned from Johnson county.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. It might be that this was a new case in this House; but he
                            referred the gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Dunham] to a case somewhat
                            similar, that occurred in this Hall in 1857. A gentleman appeared before
                            the House of Representatives of the session of that year with a
                            certificate of election from the county of Rush. But the House overruled
                            the certificate, and the gentleman did not take his seat during the
                            session. The county of Rush went unrepresented that session, because it
                            was said outside that he received his certificate of election by
                            fraudulent votes. If then the House could do that-could decide that this
                            man could Lot take a seat here to which he was accredited by
                            certificate, certainly it is competent for us now to admit this man to a
                            seat, without a certificate, who is elected according to all reports
                            outside. Gentlemen all know how high party spirit runs. Should we
                            concede the power of revising the certificate in one case and deny it in
                            another ? The power assumed by this Johnson county Clerk, if admitted
                            here, would be sufficient to destroy the legislative power of the State.
                            He submitted that where the Clerk contumaciously refuses to give the
                            certificate, we should not be bound by it. By voting for this motion he
                            would not indicate which way he would vote if the seat should be
                            contested. He did not think Johnson county disfranchised.
                        Mr. BROWN thought this question already disposed of here, by the adoption
                            of the resolution offered by Mr. Griffith. But putting it on the ground
                            that the motion is in order, he still insisted that this body could not
                            maintain its dignity and self-respect by adopting it, unless the
                            gentleman presents prima facia evidence of his
                            election-evidence not only that he received a majority of the legal
                            votes, but that he possesses the requisite qualifications. Did we know
                            that he was a resident of the State of Indiana, or that he had resided
                            within the year past in the county of Johnson? It was for this reason,
                            he had said, that the House, would not maintain its dignity and
                            self-respect if we declare him a member without his presenting prima facie evidence of his election. There was the
                            best evidence that he was not elected. There had been sufficient time
                            for the gentleman to have compelled the Clerk to give him a certificate,
                            but instead of that he comes here without evidence even that he has made
                            the attempt.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippocanoe, made a question of order against the
                            consideration of the motion, because of the adoption of Mr. Griffith's
                            resolution, but for a different, reason from that urged by the gentleman
                            from Jackson [Mr. Brown.] The adoption of that resolution to inquire
                            into the power of the clerk contumaciously to refuse the certificate,
                            and into the power of the House to punish the offense,seemed to him that
                            the matter was settled by this action, and that the right was withheld
                            from us to swear him in.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK would not presume to express an opinion in the case until he
                            had heard the evidence. We were apprised that there is a contest, and
                            the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham] moves that Mr. Banta be sworn
                            ia as a member. It seemed to him that something should appear upon the
                            records of the House, showing the authority by which every member holds
                            his seat. It was his judgment that where a certificate has not been
                            issued, a gentleman should not be sworn in before the evidence has been
                            heard by the House. But if it were the pleasure of members to disregard
                            this, he respectfully suggested the propriety of first offering a
                            resolution declaring this gentleman to be duly elected from the county
                            of Johnson, and that the Clerk refused his certificate. That would place
                            upon the record some show of authority for action upon the pending
                            motion.
                        Mr.BIRD, of Allen, moved that the House adjourn till 2 o'clock.
                        Accordingly, the House took a recess till that hour.
                    


                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        The SPEAKER announced the question to be on the adoption of the motion of
                            the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.]
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the motion by way of substitute, as
                            follows:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, It appears to this House that at
                                        the late genernl election held in the county of Johnson, on
                                        the 11th day of October, 1864, Elijah Banta received a
                                        majority of all the votes cast for Representative of said
                                        county in the present General Assembly; and whereas, it
                                        further appears that the Clerk of the Johnson Circuit Court
                                        has refused to ispue a certificate of election to said
                                        Banta, on the ground that the election of said Banta is
                                        contested; and whereas,no other person holds a certificate
                                        of election as Representative of said county of Johnson,
                                        therefore-- 


                                    
                                        Be it Resolved, That, until it is shown by
                                        an investigation of said contest, that some other person is
                                        entitled to said seat, said Banta is entitled to be admitted
                                        as a member of this House, and that the Speaker be
                                        instructed to administer to said Elijah Banta the oath of
                                        office prescribed for members of this body.
                                
                            


                        
                        He also presented papers accompanying the resolutions which were read for
                            information. The papers were attested certificates by Mr. Banta and Mr.
                            Oyler, establishing the facts set: forth in the resolution.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK desired to amend the preamble by avoiding the words "legal
                            votes."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB had not said in the preamble, or resolution that he received
                            a majority of the legal votes, but simply "a majority of the votes
                            cast"
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired the resolution to be kept free from any decision of
                            the case. He would be satisfied if the gentleman would amend the
                            preamble with the words "as returned in the canvass."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. I accept that.
                        Mr. BROWN. I move to refer the resolution and the papers to the on the
                            Judiciary.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved to lay this motion on the table, but withdrew for

                        
                        Mr. DUNHAM, who simply desired to say that since the forenoon session he
                            had looked into the statute, and he would call the attention of members
                            to it. It seemed to him that the House would be forestalling the law. It
                            would be found by reference to the statute that the clerk is not
                            required to certify to the election of a member when there is a contest,
                            but only where there is none. The Librarian refuses to let the books
                            come out of the library, and therefore he was compelled to make a loose
                            reference in this way. He did not see what was to be gained by this
                            action. Gentlemen on the opposite side had a clear majority, and there
                            was no inducement to do what be conceived to be a violation of the
                            statute. He preferred that the resolution should go to the
                                Judiciary Committee .
                        Mr. NEWCOMB showed again the possibility of the combination of clerks
                            destroying the legislative power of the State if the doctrine contended
                            for should obtain here. And then, if there was anything in the statute
                            giving the clerk jurisdiction over the qualification of members here, it
                            was clearly void, because the Constitution provides that the House shall
                            be judge of the qualification of its members. He showed that in the case
                            of county officers it was provided that they should hold till their
                            successors be chosen and qualified. But it was not so with members of
                            the Legislature; and this was the reason he was in favor of hearing this
                            matter now, to save the disfranchisement of constituencies. He wished it
                            to be known, now and for all time, that it is not competent for the
                            clerks of the circuit court to destroy the General Assembly. He would
                            have no more cases in the history of our Legislature where a whole
                            county is kept out of representation here, as in the case he named this
                            morning of the county of Rush. The Constitution says the people shall
                            have representation, and that each House shall decide upon the
                            qualification of its members. And because the adoption of this
                            resolution cannot change the merits of the case--cannot harm either
                            side--he thought it behooved the House to take this action, promptly. He
                            desired this for political reasons to prevent the recurrence of such
                            cases hereafter. He neither felt nor acted as a partisan in this matter,
                            but would simply do his duty as a member of this House.
                        Mr. HARRISON quoted particularly the provisions of the statute referred
                            to by the gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Dunham.]
                        After further debate, in which Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, Mr.
                            BROWN and Mr. LASALLE participated--
                        Mr. BRANHAM renewed his motion to lay on the table the amendment of Mr.
                            Buskirk. Which was agreed to.
                        The question recurred on the adoption of the preamble and resolutions-Mr.
                            Newcomb accepting the insertion in the preamble of the words "as
                            returned by the officers of election."
                        
                        Mr. BROWN and Mr. COLLINS demanded the yeas and nays on the adoption of
                            the proposition, and they were ordered, and being taken, resulted--yeas
                            54, nays 34--as follows:


                        
                        
                            
                                

                                    YEAS-Messrs. Atkinson, Bonner, Boyd, Branham, Burnes,
                                        Chambers, Church, Cook, Cox, Crook, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke,

                                        Wright, Zigler and Mr Speaker-54.
                                    NAYS-Messrs Abbett, Beckel, Bird, Brown, Burton, Burwell,
                                        Buskirk, Coffroth, Collins, Crone, Dunham, Grayebrook,

                                        Scott, Thatcher, Veach, and White-34.

                                
                            
                        
                        So the preamble and resolution were adopted.
                         And Mr. Banta came forward, received the oath and took his seat.


                        
                             STATIONERY. 
                            Mr. RICE submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the State Librarian be
                                            ordered to furnush to each member of the House now in
                                            session a sufficient amount of stationery on the order
                                            of the Clerk.

                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BRANHAM. I move that the resolution be referred to a select , as
                                was the case two years ago.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH. I would move to amend by striking out and inserting "on
                                the order of each member."
                            The SPEAKER. If not accepted, the amendment is excluded.
                             Mr. Branham's motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                            instructed to contract with the proprietors of the Daily
                                            State Sentinel and the Daily Indianapolis Journal for
                                            three copies each, or the use of members and elective
                                            officers of this House two copies of each number to be
                                            enveloped and stamped.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, suggested three copies of the Gazette.
                            Mr. BROWN. It has been the custom to take only the papers of the
                                local organs of the two parties. That was the case two years ago.
                                And this Gazette comes in the afternoon, at a time when members are
                                most likely to be engaged in business, and it would prove a greater
                                annoyance than benefit.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, then withdrew his motion, and proposed to
                                add the two German papers printed in this city.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, accepted the modification.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the matter to a select .
                            Mr. GRIFFITH, after an ineffectual motion to lay the motion to refer
                                on the table, spoke briefly against the reference.

                                            copy of journals of the last session, on the desk of
                                            each member of this House.
                                    
                                
                            

                            Mr. DUNHAM suggested that the statutes might not be in the hands of
                                the Librarian, and proposed an amendment if the State Librarian have
                                them on hand.

                            Pending the consideration of which, the House adjourned till tomorrow
                                morning at nine o'clock.

                        

                    
                


                
                
                     IN SENATE. 
                    
                        FRIDAY, January 6, 1864.
                    
                    Mr. COBB announced that Mr. Packard was no longer a candidate for
                        Door-keeper, and returned thanks in behalf of Mr. P. to the Democratic
                        Senators who had supported him for that position.
                    Mr. CULLEN withdrew his resolution pending at the time of adjournment last
                        evening.
                    Mr. WILLIAMS nominated Archibald Johnson, of Putnam, for Principal
                        Door-keeper of the Senate.
                    
                    The Senate proceeded to vote for Door-keeper, and three ballots were
                        taken--the seventh, eighth and ninth--resulting as follows: 25 votes for Mr.
                        Archibald Johnson, and 25 votes for Mr. John H. Johnson.
                     Mr. WILLIAMS then withdrew the name of Archibald Johnson.
                    Mr. VAWTER nominated John W. Ryan, of Hancock county.
                    
                    The Senate then proceeded with the tenth and eleventh ballot--Mr. Ryan
                        receiving 25 votes, and Mr. J. H. Johnson 25 votes.
                    Mr. DOWNEY offered the following:
                    
                        
                            
                                Resolved,That Percy Rous be appointed
                                    Doorkeeper, and J. S. Morgan, Assistant Door-keeper.
                            
                        
                    
                    Mr DOWNEY said: The first named candidate is a resident of Switzerland
                        county, a supporter of the Administration, and has been a Captain in our
                        country's service for three years. The other gentleman named is the nominee
                        of the Democratic caucus.
                    Mr. THOMPSON thought balloting here would not amount to mtrch, and appealed
                        to the gentlemen who, if they had submitted to an election last October,
                        would not be here, to stop the matter now, because, if it is not done,
                        Monday or Tuesday will stop it. We will have the presiding officer then and
                        he will stop it. He contended that it was with the tacit consent ot the
                        Republican party that the Secretaries were elected.
                    Mr. COBB was of opinion, very decidedly, that the principal officers of the
                        Senate were elected through the legitimate votes of its members, disengaged
                        to some extent from party spirit. It is since then that the party strife has
                        come up.
                    Mr. DUNNING stood here prepared to vote against the resolution, because he
                        would not cast his vote for any man for Door-keeper, except that man be the
                        nominee of the Republican party. The proposition of'the Senator from Ohio
                        [Mr. Downey] was the coolest thing of the seasonbeing, as it was, an attempt
                        to deprive the Republicans of an officer of the Senate, If we are to give up
                        John H. Johnson, let the Democrats nomioate a man at ail acceptable, and
                        that man Bhall be elected, if the Democrats stand up to him; but if the
                        Republicans stand by our nominee, until it is in caucus determined that he
                        is no longer our candidate, I will vote for him until Gabriel puts one foot
                        upon the earth and the other in heaven, and summons the world to judgment.
                        [Applause.] With regard to the Secretaries, he had pledged himself to them
                        in October last, and he would have redeemed his pledge if it had brought
                        down upon him the displeasure of every member of the Senate.
                    
                         STATIONERY. 
                        Mr. WILLIAMS, by unanimous consent, offered the following resolution,
                            which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the Librarian be authorized
                                        to furnish stationery to the members of the Senate, upon
                                        their orders.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         THE DOOR KEEPERS AGAIN. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, submitted the following as a substitute for
                            Mr.Downey's resolution:

                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That a committee of four, to
                                        consist of Senators Corbin, Cobb, Dunning and Beeson, be
                                        appointed to select candidates for Principal and Assistant
                                        Door-keepers of the Senate, and the the candidates so
                                        selected be elected by resolution.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BEESON objected to being placed on the committee.
                        The PRESIDENT  pro tem. [Mr. Dunning] announced the
                            authorized by resolution on yesterday to prepare rules for the
                            government of the Senate, viz: Messrs. Williams, Bennett, Vawter, Niles
                            and Oyler.
                        Mr. BENNETT thought he never saw Democrats here so anxious for office.
                            With a Republican majority of 20,000 votes in the State, it is singular
                            that Democrats will bold out so strenuously for these, the poorest
                            offices in the gift of the Senate. He insisted, as he did yesterday,
                            that if this thing was to be compromised, it should have been effected
                            before any of the officers were elected. Before he would let any
                            Democrat point out the Republican candidate now, he would give all the
                            offices to the other side, He insisted that the Senate was as well
                            prepared to go on with the legitimate business of the session without a
                            doorkeeper as with one.
                        Mr. VAWTER asked, if the Democrats were to withdraw their candidate,
                            would the Republicans withdraw theirs?the Democrats to nominate the
                            principal, and the Republicans the Assistant Doorkeeper. 

                        
                         MANY MEMBERS"No," ''No," 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, withdrew his substitute.

                        
                        The resolution (Mr. Downey's) was rejected by yeas 24, nays 26.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, offered the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That a committee of four,
                                        consisting of two Republicans and two Democrats, be
                                        appointed to elect candidates for principal and assistant
                                        door-keepers of the Senate, and that the candidates so
                                        selected shall be elected by resolution.

                            The invitation was accepted, and accordingly the Senate proceeded to

                    The House met at 9:45 A. M.


                    The Journal of yesterday having been read and authenticated-

                    
                         SPECIAL ON STATIONERY AND STAMPS. 
                        The SPEAKER announced the following special committee on
                                Stationery and Stamps, under the resolution of yesterday,
                            viz: Messrs: Branham, Miller of Clinton, Miller of Tippecanoe, Meredith
                            and Bird.
                    

                    
                         PUTNAM AND CLINTON CONTESTS 
                        The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of Mr. Stringer's
                            resolution on this subject, pending yesterday at the hour of
                            adjournment.
                        Mr. STRINGER asked and obtained leave to withdraw the resolution. 
                    
                    
                         NEWSPAPER REPORTERS. 
                        Mr. SHOAFF of Jay submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved ,That newspaper reporters be
                                        allowed seats inside the bar for the purpose of reporting
                                        the proceedings of the House.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said he would like to have a little more scope than to
                            confine the resolution to reporters for papers paid for by the House. It
                            had been suggested to him that a reporter for a Cincinnati paper desired
                            a seat. He had seen advantage taken of this privilege; but had no
                            objection, to the presence of reporters who attend to their
                            business.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to refer the resolution to the special on Stationery and
                            Stamps.
                        Mr. COLLINS proposed to amend, by specifying "reporters for such papers
                            as the House subscribe for, and such as the Speaker shall admit."
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, accepted the modification.
                        
                        And then the resolution was referred to the special affirmative 36,
                            negative 35.
                        On motions by Mr. DUNHAM and Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. Benjamin F. Goodman,
                            Representative from Crawford county, and Mr. James M. Humphreys,
                            Representative from Greece county, came forward and qualified by
                            receiving the oath of office at the hands of the Speaker, and took their
                            seats. 
                    
                    
                         ASSISTANT DOOR-KEEPERS. 
                        Mr. BARNES submitted the following: 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper of the House
                                        be authorized to employ a sufficient number of assistants to
                                        discharge the various duties of his office, and also to
                                        procure three thermometers to be hung in this Hall.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BOYD proposed a modification by adding"'subject to the approval of
                            the Speaker."
                        Which was accepted, and so the resolution was adopted.

                    

                    
                         CLAIMS. 
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee of
                                            Ways and Means be instructed to allow no
                                        claims to go into the Specific Appropriation bill which
                                        shall not be presented within ten days of the close of the
                                        session, unless the same shall have accrued within the last
                                        twelve twelve days of the session.
                                
                            
                        


                        Mr. MILLER. The object is to give time for the examination of claims.
                         The resolution was adopted; and then-
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the resolution was referred to the
                                Committee of Ways and Means.
                    
                    
                         POSTAGE STAMPS. 
                        Mr. VEATCH. Mr. Speaker I offer the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                        instructed to procure and deliver to each member of the
                                        House $3 worth of postage stamps--$2 worth of one cent
                                        stamps, and $1 worth of three cent stamps.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. THATCHER made an ineffectual motion  to refer the resolution to the Special on
                            Stationery.
                        Mr. SULLIVAN proposed to amend by striking out "one cent stamps,'' and
                            inserting "three cent stamps."
                        Mr. BROWN moved to refer the resolution and proposed amendment to the
                            Select on Stationery and Postage.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, not knowing where the Door-keeper would get the money, hoped
                            the House would refer the resolution.
                        It was accordingly referred.
                        And then, on motion of Mr. BRANHAM, in order to give time for the duties
                            of the Special s and the Speaker, took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                    



                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 2 P. M. He laid before the House a
                            communication from the Secretary ot State, transmitting papers in
                            relation to the contested election cases from the county of Putnam;
                            also, papers in relation to the contested election case from the county
                            of Clinton.

                        On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the communication was referred to the
                                Committee on Elections.

                        
                             GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. 
                             A message was now received from the Senate by Mr. Whittlesey, their
                                Secretary, communicating a resolution of organisation by that
                                body,and also a concurrent resolution, acquainting His Excellency,
                                the Governor, of the fact of organization, and the appointment of a
                                committee on their part (Senators Downing and Van Buskirk,) to wait
                                on the Governor, &c.
                            On motion, by Mr. BUSKIRK, the resolution just received from the
                                Senate was taken up, considered and concurred in.
                            Where upon--
                            The SPEAKER announced the special joint on the part of the House of
                                Representatives, viz: Messrs. Brown, McVey and Gregory, of
                                Montgomery.
                            On motion, by Mr. BROWN, this was granted leave of absence for
                                immediate service.
                            Mr. BRANHAM, on the part of the special on stationery and postage,
                                stated that there was no appropriation for the purchase of stamps,
                                and promised a bill for that object soon.
                        

                        
                             RULES-BOOKS. 
                            Mr. BUSKIRK, from the special to revise the rules, submitted a
                                report, recommending the adoption of the Rules and Joint Rules of
                                the last session, with one amendment, and that three hundred copies
                                thereof be printed for the use of the House of Representatives. The
                                amendment reported is proposed to the 58th Rule, adding these words:
                                "Except before the House proceeds to other business, a motion is
                                made to dispense with the constitutional provision requiring the
                                reading on three several days, and such motion shall be a privilege
                                question and decided without debate."
                            Mr. B. stated that this amendment was proponed to be added to the
                                Rule which prescribes: that the first reading of a bill shall be for
                                information, and, if opposition be made at this stage, the bill may
                                be rejected, but if no opposition be made then the bill shall go to
                                the second reading without question. The amendment adds the words as
                                above.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. If the House direct the purchase of the Statutes for
                                members there was no need of printing the Constitution with the
                                Rules. He preferred a limited number of copies of the Statutes for
                                the s.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK said he was requested by the State Librarian to state
                                that he had received a communication purporting to come from the
                                Clerk of this House, informing him of the passage of the resolution
                                offered by Mr. B. yesterday, which was not passed, but referred to a
                                special . He was requested by the Librarian to say, further, that in
                                pursuance of this authority he had entered into a contract with some
                                person in this city for the Statutes, and had sent an order to
                                Boston for the manuals, which could not be obtained short of Boston.
                                The Clerk, evidently, had acted under a misapprehension as to the
                                passage of the resolution.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. There certainly had been evinced an unusual amount of
                                diligence in this matter. The ordering of the books from Boston,
                                especially, he thought somebody deserves credit for. The question
                                was-Shall we take $750 of the people's money, and put it into the
                                hands of some person here, or not? He was decidedly in favor of
                                countermanding the order sent to Boston.
                            The SPEAKER. The question is on the adoption of the matter reported
                                by the gentleman from Monroe.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. The Constitution printed with the rules had been found
                                very convenient for members, and he desired to have it so printed,
                                even if we purchase the Statutes. He desired immediate action on the
                                matter.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH wished to make a disclaimer on the part of the Clerk of
                                the House. The Clerk himself had not made any such order as that
                                acted on by the Librarian; but there had been a misapprehension

                             RECRUITS FOR UNEXPIRED TERMS. 
                            There is a peculiar hardship existing in regard to the recruits of
                                1862 for the old regiments. They undoubtedly enlisted upon the
                                understanding that hey were to be mustered out along with the
                                regiments into which they went, and would net be re Id for three
                                years from the time of their enlistment. This understanding was
                                participated in by their recruiting officers, the general mustering
                                officer stationed here by the Government, and by the State
                                authorities. When the time came for mustering out their regiments,
                                they demanded their discharge, which was refused. I presented the
                                matter to the Secretary of War, who declined to act on it on the
                                ground that the formal master roll which they had signed, showed
                                that they had entered the service for the period of three years, and
                                left him no discretion to interfere in their behalf. This was true,
                                but nevertheless, the understanding existed hi full force, as the
                                statement in the muster roll was explained by the mustering officer
                                as a mere technical necessity. I afterwards addressed a memorial on
                                the subject to Congress, stating all the frets, and inviting them to
                                take action for the relief of these men, but they failed to do so at
                                the time, I present the matter for your consideration, trusting that
                                you will see fit to lay it before Congress.
                        
                        
                             GALLANTRY OF INDIANA SOLDIERS. 
                            The duty of appointing officers to command our regiment is full of
                                responsibility and embarrassment I have commissioned many whom I did
                                not know, and for whose fitness I was compelled to rely entirely
                                upon the opinion of others. But it affords me great gratification to
                                state that the Indiana officers as a body have been found equal to
                                those of any other State; that they have upon every battle-field
                                nobly sustained the great cause, and shed lustre upon the flag,
                                under which they fought. Many have been appointed to high commands,
                                in which they acquitted themselves with the greatest honor and
                                ability, and very many have nobly laid down their lives in battle
                                for their country. Our private soldiers have behaved with uniform
                                and distinguished gallantry in every action in which they have been
                                engaged. They form a part of every army in the field, and have been
                                among the for the foremost in deeds of daring, while their blood has
                                hallowed every soil. Hitherto engaged, in the peaceful pursuits of
                                trade and agriculture, they have manifested that lofty courage and
                                high-toned chivalry of which others have talked so much and
                                possessed so little, and which belong only to the intelligent
                                patriot who understands well the sacred cause in which he draws his
                                sword. Thousands have fallen the victims of an unnatural rebellion.
                                They were fighting from deep convictions of duty and the love they
                                bore their country. Their unlettered graves mark an hundred
                                battle-fields, and our country can never discharge to their memory
                                and their posterity the debt of gratitude it owes. That gratitude
                                should be testified by the tender care we take of their families and
                                dependent ones whom they have left behind, and by the education of
                                their children.
                        
                        
                             GETTYSBURG CEMETERY. 
                            After the battle of Gettysburg, arrangements were made by the State
                                of Pennsylvania, for the establishment of a national cemetery upon
                                the battle-field, in which each State having troops engaged, should
                                have a place set apart for the burial of its dead. As Indiana lost
                                many gallant and cherished sons in that great conflict, I took the
                                responsibility of cooperation with Pennsylvania and other States, by
                                the appointment of Colonel John G. Stephenson, as commissioner to
                                select the place and superintend, the removal thereto of our dead.
                                These duties he faithfully performed, and for more full information
                                you are referred to his report herewith submitted ; and for an
                                account of the expenses incurred, to the financial report of Mr.
                                Terrell. For my action in this matter, your approval is respectfully
                                solicited.
                        
                        
                             CARE OF SOLDIERS' FAMILIES. 
                            I invite your immediate attention to the necessity of making an
                                appropriation for the relief and support of the families of our
                                soldiers. It is too well understood to require argument or
                                statement, that the monthly pay which they receive, especially after
                                deducting that part which their own wants in the field absolutely
                                require them to expend, is wholly insufficient for the support of
                                their families, at this period 
                                of high prices. The duty resting upon the people of the state to
                                provide, support and prevent suffering and destitution in these
                                cases, is also too clear for argument, and needs only to be started
                                to command general assent. If the relief be furnished in the manner
                                proposed, the burden will fall upon all the people of the State
                                according to their several capacities to bear it, and will be so
                                light as to be scarcely felt, and will, I am sure,be cheerfully
                                borne. It is an hour of great trial to the nation, and solemn duties
                                are devolved upon the people, whether at home or in the field. Our
                                soldiers are performing their duties gloriously, and to the
                                admiration of the world. Let the people at home do theirs, and all
                                will be well.
                        
                        
                             INDIANA STATE SANITARY COMMISSION. 

                            I have thought proper to lay before you the report of Dr. Hannarnan,
                                President, and Alfred Harrison, Treasurer, of the Indiana State
                                Sanitary Commission. Since its formal organization on the 3d day of
                                March, 1862, it has received contributions in money to the amount of
                                One Hundred and Fifty-five Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety-six
                                Dollars and Forty-five cents, and supplies for the army valued at
                                Three Hundred and Thirteen Thousand, Six Hundred and Five Dollars,
                                and sixty-six cents, making an aggregate of Four Hundred and
                                Sixty-nine Thousand Four Hundred and Two Dollars, and Eleven
                                Cents.As to the manner in which this money and these supplies have
                                been expended and distributed, and the number, management, and
                                operations of the Various military agencies that have been
                                established, the appointment of special surgeons, and traveling
                                Sanitary Commissioners, you are referred to Dr. Hannaman's report.
                                This Commission has been instrumental in preserving many lives, and
                                relieving untold suffering and distress. It has received no support
                                from the fairs held in the great cities, in which large sums have
                                been realized, but has been sustained by a system of collections and
                                voluntary contributions on the part of our people, which are fully
                                described by Dr. Hannaman. I am aware that as this Commission has
                                not been established by law, and is not therefore legally
                                responsible to the Legislature, it may be said by some that you
                                should take no cognizance of it whatever, but as the people of the
                                State have a right to know what disposition has been made of their
                                patriotic gifts, and as the soldiers of Indiana are deeply
                                interested in its continued success, which can only be maintained by
                                preserving the confidence of the people in its integrity and
                                efficiency, it is my desire, and that of all the officers engaged in
                                its administration, that you should take cognizance of it, and
                                institute, such investigation, by a proper , as will establish its
                                merits and claims to public confidence, or enable its enemies to
                                point out its defects.
                            I cannot leave the subject without expressing to Dr. Hannaman my
                                sincere thanks for the devotion, ability, and disinterested
                                patriotism with which he has presided over its affairs. For more
                                than two years he has entirely abandoned his business, and given his
                                time and labor wholly to the great work of relief to our sick and
                                wounded soldiers, without reward or the hope of it, and has thus set
                                a noble example before our countryman of the spirit in which the
                                burthens and duties of the war should be borne. Nor should I omit to
                                return thanks to the Treasurer and all other officers of the
                                Commission, for their devotion and efficiency in the discharge of
                                their duties; and especially to the patriotic women of Indiana by
                                whose labors and influence the greater part of the contributions
                                have been made .Their zeal has not been diminished by the
                                protraction of the war, but has increased with the increasing wants
                                of our soldiers; and while many have labored unceasingly with their
                                hands, others have given most liberally, and often from very small
                                means. They have their reward in the support they have given to the
                                cause, and the gratitude of the many thousands of brave hearts that
                                they have made light and happy.
                            The duties of collecting back pay, pensions, and bounties for our
                                soldiers and soldiers' widows and orphans, free of charge, I
                                devolved upon the agencies established at Washington and in this
                                city, nearly two years ago, and they have accomplished much good in
                                that way. But I have not been able to employ the force necessary to
                                meet the demands of a business so large and important, and I
                                recommend that such legislation be had as will establish agencies
                                upon a permanent basis, with a force sufficient to transact the
                                business, and save the claimants from the great sacrifice they may
                                otherwise be compelled to make, many of whom are but poorly able to
                                bear it. 
                        

                        
                             SOLDIERS' VOTES. 
                            Under the provisions of our constitution, no person can vote except
                                in the,precinct in which he resides. This should be so amended in my
                                opinion, as to enable uch of our citizens as are in the military
                                service of the Government, and who would be entitled to a vote if at
                                home, to vote wherever they may be, in camp or field, under such
                                reasonable regulations and slant men who are absent from home,
                                because they are fighting the battles of their country. I earnestly
                                hope that immediate steps will be taken to relieve our constitution
                                of this injustice, and although it may not be accomplished in time
                                to become operative during the war, it should not on that account be
                                neglected. 
                        

                        
                             LEGION. 
                            It is important to the peace and security of the State, that we have
                                a well organized and equipped Militia, which may be speedily called
                                out in case of an emergency. To the officers and men of the Indiana
                                Legion, the State chiefly owes the immunity she had enjoyed from
                                invasion, plunder and murder, by the guerrillas and marauding bands
                                which have infested many of the adjoining counties of Kentucky. On
                                several occasions they met the enemy in battle, when they ably
                                maintained the credit of the State, and behaved with that
                                distinguished courage which has characterized the soldiers of
                                Indiana throughout this war. Some have fallen in battle, and I
                                earnestly recommend that their families be provided for, and placed
                                upon a footing at least equal to the families of those who fall in
                                the Federal service.
                            The organization, discipline and efficiency of the Militia should be
                                encouraged, and promoted by every means and inducement which the
                                Legislature can present, and placed, if possible, upon an enduring
                                basis. It should be so organized that every person capable of
                                performing military duty, might in an emergency, be compelled to
                                render military service, and the defence of the State not left to
                                those only who enter voluntary organizations. Where all are equally
                                interested, all should be subject to equal duties and obligations,
                                and no Militia system can be regarded as efficient for the
                                protection of the State, under which every able bodied man within
                                military age cannot, upon an emergency, be called into the field. In
                                this respect the present law is entirely wanting, and in many others
                                is so defective as to make it a matter of surprise that the
                                organization of the Legion should have been so efficient and well
                                maintained as it has. I therefore call your attention to the
                                necessity of so amending the law, as to create a military
                                organization that will be efficient and suited to the circumstances
                                by which we are surrounded.
                            The very able report of Major General Mansfield, of the general
                                operations and condition of the Legion for the last two years is
                                interesting and important. 
                        
                        
                             QUARTERMASTER'S REPORT. 
                            The report of the Quartermaster and Commissary General is herewith
                                laid before you, and your attention especially called to its
                                contents. The Administration of this department by General Stone has
                                been highly successful and satisfactory.


                        
                        
                             EXPENDITURES OF THE PAYMASTER. 
                            The State Paymaster, Major Stearns Fisher, has disbursed for all
                                purposes he sum of two hundred and fifty-eight thousand six hundred
                                and ten and 10-100 dollars. Of this amount I advanced to him one
                                hundred and seventy-one thousand six hundred and sixty-one dollars
                                and eighty-eight cents, of which he repaid to me the sum of fifty
                                thousand dollars. He drew by my order from the special military
                                fund, created by the law of 1861, the sum of seventy-five thousand
                                dollars. When this latter sum was refunded to me by the Government
                                upon filing with it the receipted pay rolls, I paid the money into
                                the State Treasury to the credit of the appropriation  from which it was drawn, and from
                                which he has drawn again, the sum of sixty-nine thousand eight
                                hundred and forty-two dollars and nine cents- According to his
                                report, which is herewith submitted, the whole amount of liabilities
                                incurred to the Indiana Legion and minute men, for military
                                services, is four hundred and nineteen thousand seven hundred and
                                forty-two dollars and eight cents, of which amount the sum of two
                                hundred and thirty-five thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight
                                dollars and forty-six cents has been paid. Having unpaid the sum of
                                one hundred and eighty-three thousand nine hundred and seventy-three
                                dollars and sixty-two cents. But the Paymaster has still in his
                                hands the sum of twenty-seven thousand four hundred and
                                seventy-three dollars and seventy- even cents in cash, leaving the
                                balance to be provided for.
                        
                        
                             DAMAGES BY THE MORGAN RAID. 
                            In the month of July, 1863, the State was invaded by the rebel
                                General John Morgan, and the forces under his command. In response
                                to a call which I issued for military forces for the purpose of
                                capturing and punishing this robber horde, our people flew to arms
                                in numbers and with an alacrity before unknown in the history of the
                                war. In a few short hours the invasion was converted into a flight,
                                and the invaders being all mounted, were enabled to effect their
                                escape over our eastern border, into Ohio, where they were finally
                                captured. During their brief presence in the State, however, they
                                inflicted much damage by the destruction of property, the plundering
                                of stores, the stealing of horses and provisions, and robberies of
                                various kinds. The true theory of our government is that it shall
                                protect the people in their persons and property against invasion
                                and loss from the public enemy, or injury by domestic insurrection.
                                Where losses in property have been thus sustained, it is much easier
                                for the people of the State to bear them in their
                                collective-capacity than it is for the particular individuals upon
                                whom they have fallen. In many instances, persons who lost teir
                                property in the Morgan raid were in humble circumstances, and were
                                put to great inconvenience thereby, and in some cases reduced even
                                to destitution. I therefore recommend that a commission be created,
                                clothed with such powers as will enable them to make a full and
                                careful appraisement of the damages sustained, and that an
                                appropriation be made to defray them out of the Treasury, when they
                                have been legally assessed. As there is a natural tendency to
                                exaggerate damages when they are to be paid for by the public, such
                                safeguards should be adopted by the commission as with prevent
                                imposition upon the State.
                        
                        
                             ARSENAL. 
                            When our first regiments were ready to take the field, they were
                                unprovided with ammunition, and as none could be readily procured,
                                it became necessary to have it prepared. Colonel Sturm then was
                                engaged for that purpose. He had studied the art in Europe, and was
                                thoroughly instructed in all its details. He succeeded well in the
                                enterprise from the beginning, and his ammunition was pronounced the
                                very best in use. Thus was the Arsenal established, and as the
                                demand for ammunition daily increased, and the necessity so far from
                                passing away became constantly greater as the war progressed, what
                                was first intended as a temporary convenience, became a large and
                                permanent establishment. Colonel Sturm continued at the head of the
                                establishment, managing it with great success and ability, preparing
                                ammunition of every description for artillery and small arms, not
                                only supplying our own troops when going to the field, but sending
                                immense quantities to the armies in the West and South. In several
                                emergencies, the armies in the West and South were supplied from
                                here, when they could not procure it in time from other arsenals,
                                and serious disasters thereby avoided. 
                            Shortly after the Arsenal was fully established, It was brought to
                                the attention of the War Department, and the ammunition having been
                                thoroughly tested, the Government agreed to pay for what had already
                                been issued, and to receive and pay for what should be prepared
                                thereafter, at prices which were mutually satisfactory to both
                                parties. These prices were generally below what the Government paid
                                for ammunition, but such as, it was believed, would fairly indemnify
                                the State for all costs and expenses incurred on that account.
                            The operations of the Arsenal were suspended during the session of
                                the late Legislature, and its condition and results fully reported
                                to that body. No Legislative action having been taken in regard to
                                it, and the necessity for its continued operations still existing in
                                full force, I proposed to the Auditor and Treasurer of State, that
                                they should co-operate with me in carrying it forward. This they
                                declined; to do, on the ground that it was not authorized by law.
                                Afterwards I determined to take the responsibility of continuing its
                                operations, provided the Legislative Auditing would examine and
                                audit all items of expenditure that might be incurred on that
                                account. To this the agreed upon condition that one of their number
                                should be selected to be present at the Arsenal at all times, for
                                the daily examination of its expenditures, and inspection of its
                                operations. With this arrangement I was well satisfied, and the
                                selected the Hon. Samuel H. Buskirk for that duty. He continued in
                                the performance of the duties thus assigned him with ability and
                                industry, until the final winding up of the Arsenal, at which time
                                the made a full report of its operations, which is herewith
                                submitted. It will be found from an examination of this report, and
                                the detailed accounts of the arsenal from the time of its starting,
                                that it yielded a net cash profit to the State of seventy-one
                                thousand three hundred and eighty dollars and one cent, ($71,380
                                01,) besides having on hand, for future use, if necessary all the
                                tools and apparatus stored away in the Quartermaster's Department,
                                valued at four thousand and two dollars and forty-four cents. All
                                sums at, any time drawn from the State Treasury, on account of the
                                Arsenal, have been referred, and the profits only bave remained in
                                my hand, which I have charged against myself in the general account,
                                and have used in defraying the expanses of the State Government. It
                                was no part of the original plan that profits should result to the
                                State from its operations, and they have sprung solely from the
                                economical and skillfull management, for which Colonel Sturm is
                                entitled to the chief credit. Its original establishment and
                                continuance were strictly a military necessity, and whether
                                absolutely covered by the law or not, have been of great benefit to
                                the ctate and the Government. It entailed upon me great
                                responsibility and anxiety, from which I gladly escaped at the
                                earliest moment.
                        

                        
                             EDUCATION. 
                            Your attention is called to the report of the Superintendent of
                                Public Instruction, and the suggestions and recommendations
                                contained in it. The School Law requires,amendment in several
                                important particulars, and it is believed that the fund can ba
                                materially increased without adding to the burthens of the people of
                                the State.
                            While Indiana has a larger school fund than any other State, she has
                                not, by any means, the best system of common schools. Money alone
                                will not make good schools, and an indispensable requisite is
                                educated and disciplined teachers. The necessity for a State Normal
                                School has been severely felt for many years, and earnestly urged by
                                the most eminent teachers and friends of education. Indeed, I am
                                satisfied from my own observation, and the recorded experience of
                                other States, that our system of common schools can never even
                                approach to what it ought to be, until an institution shall be
                                established in which teachers shall be trained and disciplined for
                                their high and honorable calling. A few thousand dollars diverted
                                every year from the school fund revenue for this purpose, would soon
                                make the expenditure of the balance vastly more beneficial to the
                                children of the State. When we consider the magnitude of the school
                                fund, the wealth of the State, and the ability of our people to pay
                                taxes for the advancement of education, there is no reason why we
                                may not have a system of common schools equal to that of any other
                                State, save the absence of qualified teachers, and these we shall
                                never have in sufficient numbers, until a State Normal School has
                                     been permanently establish
                                of sufficient capacity to receive and instruct all who desire to
                                enter the profession of teaching.
                        
                        
                             DONATION OF LAND BY CONGRESS FOR AGRICULTURAL
                                COLLEGES. 
                            In presenting the subject of the donation of land by Congress for
                                Agricultural Colleges, in the several States, I cannot do better
                                than repeat the recommendations of my former Message. 
                            "On the 2d day of July, 1862, the Congress of the United States
                                passed an act donating to each of the States not in rebellion
                                against the Government, an amount of public lands equal to 30,000
                                acres for each Senator and Representative in Congress, to which the
                                States are respectively entitled by the apportionment under the
                                census of 1860. This entitles Indiana to 390,000 acres. Whenever
                                there are public lands in the State, subject to sale at private
                                entry at $1.25 per acre, the quantity to which the State is entitled
                                shall be selected from such lands, but if there are no such lands in
                                the State, or not enough, the Secretary of the Interior is to issue
                                to the State land scrip for the requisite number of acres. This
                                scrip cannot be located by the State to which it is issued, but must
                                be sold; but the purchasers may locate it upon any of the
                                unappropriated lands of the United States subject to sale at private
                                entry at $1.25 or less per acre.
                             "There being no public lands in this State for sale at private
                                entry, held by the Government at $1.25 per acre, Indiana is entitled
                                to recieve her donation in scrip. "
                            "This donation is made upon the following conditions: First-That all
                                moneys derived from the sale of lands or scrip shall be invested in
                                stocks of the United States, or of the States, or some other safe
                                stocks yielding not less than five per centum per annum, on the par
                                value. "
                            "Second-- That the monies so invested shall constitute a perpetual
                                fund the capital of which shall never be diminished, except as
                                hereinafter stated. "
                            "Third--The interest on the stocks to be inviolably appropraited by
                                the State, to the endowment and support of at least one College in
                                which the leading object shall be, without excluding scientific and
                                classical studies, and including Military Tactics, to teach such
                                branches of learning as are related to Agriculture and Merchanic
                                arts. "
                            "Fourth-- If any portion of the fun thus invested shall by any
                                contingency be lost, it shall be fully restored by the State. "
                            "Fifth-- That portion of the said fund shall be applied to the
                                purchase, repair, or erection of any building, but that a sum not
                                exceeding ten per cent of the original amount may be expended for
                                the purchase of sites or experimental arms. "
                            "Sixth-- No State shall be entitled to the donation, unless the
                                Legislation shall express its acceptance thereof, within two years
                                from the date of the approval of the act by the President. "
                            "I recommend that the Legislature promptly express its acceptance of
                                the grant pledging the faith of the State for the performance of the
                                conditions upon which it is made. "
                            "The necessity for scientific instruction in agriculture is generally
                                acknowledged, and Congress intended by this magnificent
                                establishment of at least one efficient Agricultural College in each
                                State. "
                            "The question presents itself as to the disposition which shall be
                                made of the grant. Shall it be given to the State University, or
                                apportioned among all the Colleges in the State, upon such terms and
                                conditions as the Legislature may prescribe; or shall a new
                                Institution be created expressly designed to carry out the will of
                                Congress? It may be difficult now to determine the question from the
                                fact that we cannot know how much may be realized from the sale of
                                the scrip. If an amount should be realized large enough to endow
                                respectable and successful Professorships in each of the Colleges
                                now in the State, attaching to them experimental farms, it would
                                perhaps be the best disposition of it that could be made. But if it
                                should not be large enough for such division, which I apprehend will
                                be the case, then I recommend that it be applied to the
                                establishment of an Institution for Agriculture and Military
                                instruction, to which the children of soldiers who shall die in the
                                service during this war, shall be admitted free of charge. "
                            "At the last session of Congress, the time was extended withint which
                                the States might accept the grant, and it is important that you take
                                action upon it before the final adjournment."
                        
                        
                             EMIGRATION. 
                            It is not necessary to argue the importance of adding to the wealth
                                and population of Indiana, by increasing the emigration to her
                                borders from the various countries of Europe. The agricultural and
                                mineral resources in the State are, as yet, comparatively
                                undeveloped, for the want of population, labor, and capital. Nearly
                                one fourth of the whole area of the State is a coal field, a large
                                part of which is said to be of the best quality. Excellent iron ore
                                is found in vast quantities in many counties, and throughout the
                                State excepting a few small localities, the soil is rich and
                                fertile, capable of producing all the grains and grasses in the
                                greatest abundance. The State abound in fine timber, and living
                                streams of water, and in every respect presents facilities of an
                                easy and profitable agriculture, while an abundance of coal and
                                water power furnishes the means for manufacturing on the largest
                                scale and cheapest terms. Large tracts of country are yet unsettled,
                                and in many counties the population is quite sparse and it is not
                                too much to say, that the State can support increase and comfort a
                                population three or four time larger than the present. The war has
                                made a heavy draft upon the labor of the State, which is now scarce
                                and in great demand, and should be replenished and increased by
                                every legitimate means. I therefore earnestly recommend the
                                establishment of a Bureau of Emigration, upon a plan similar to that
                                adopted by several of the Western States, providing for one or more
                                agents in Europe, whose duty it shall be to furnish the persons
                                about to emigrate to America, information of the geography,
                                population, wealth, and resources of the State, and the prospects
                                for health, comfort, wealth, and education, presented to those who
                                come in search of new homes, and such facilities for getting here so
                                the State may be able to furnish. Some of our sister States have in
                                this way added largely to their population and wealth, and while we
                                are somewhat late in beginning, it will be later and worse for us
                                the longer it is put off. In accordance with this view I have caused
                                to be prepared and published, in both English and German, a pamphlet
                                setting forth the conditions and resources of the State, and
                                presenting the inducements offered to emigrants from abroad, copies
                                of which are herewith submitted.
                        
                        
                             COLONIZATION. 
                            I recommend that the second section of an act approved March 5th,
                                1853, which authorizes the State Board of Colonization, to appoint
                                an agent or Corresponding Secretary, be repealed. Since the passage
                                of the act, I learned that nearly $8,000 has been paid out in
                                salaries to the Secretary appointed by the Board, and in that time
                                but one man has been sent to Liberia from the State. This office is
                                a mere sine[ore?], and the duties which have been attached to it by
                                law, can be readily performed by the Secretary of State should any
                                arise in the future.
                        
                        
                             NEGRO TESTIMONY. 
                            The statute which excludes negroes from testifying in courts of
                                justice, in cases in which white persons are parties, is, in my
                                opinion, a stigma upon the humanity and intelligence of the State.
                                The idea that the white race must be protected against the colored,
                                by imposing on them this disability is absurd, and has been made the
                                cover and protection for much crime and injustice. As the law
                                stands, murder may be perpetrated with impunity, by white persons in
                                the presence only of colored witnesses, and it is well known that
                                negroes are often employed by white persons as the instruments of
                                crime and fraud, because of their inability to testify in courts of
                                justice. The interests of both races demand that this disability be
                                removed, and if the fact of color affects credibility, that can be
                                referred to the court and jury as in other cases, and would
                                undoubtedly  receive due
                                consideration. Indiana and Illinois are the only free States whose
                                statute books are dishonored by the. retention of a law so repugnant
                                to the spirit of the age, and the dictates of common sense.
                        
                        
                             ENUMERATION AND APPORTIONMENT. 
                            Sections fourth and fifth of the Constitution of the State are in
                                these words :
                            "SEC. IV. The General Assembly shall, at its second session after the
                                adoption of this Constitution, and every six years thereafter, cause
                                an enumeration to be made of all the white male inhabitants over the
                                age of twenty-one years.
                            "SEC V. The number of Senators and Representatives shall, at the
                                session next following each period of making such enumeration, be
                                fixed by law, and apportioned among the several counties, according
                                to the number of white male inhabitants above twenty-one years of
                                age in each: Provided ,That the first and second
                                elections of members of the General Assembly, under this
                                Constitution, shall be according to the apportionment last made by
                                the General Assembly, before the adoption of this Constitution "
                            The enumeration required, of the white male inhabitants of the State
                                over twenty-one years of age, has never been made. An apportionment
                                for Legislative purposes was enacted in 1857, and justice as well as
                                the constitutional provisions require that a new one shall be made.
                                Under the present law, which was very imperfect in the beginning,
                                great inequalities existed in there presentation in the Legislature,
                                and these are rapidly increasing by the increase and changes in our
                                population.
                        
                        
                             STATE TREASURER'S REPORT. 
                            The condition of the Treasury will be presented in the report of Mr.
                                Brett, State Treasurer While I have had occasion to except strongly
                                to his policy in several respects referred to in this message, it is
                                but just to say that in others the administration of his Department
                                has been entirely satisfactory.
                        
                        
                             NATIONAL DIRECT TAX. 
                            By the 6th section of an Act of Congress approved August 6th, 1861, a
                                direct annual tax of twenty millions of dollars was levied upon the
                                United States, and apportioned among the several States.
                            The apportionment devolved the payment of $904,875 33 on the State of
                                Indiana.
                            By the 53d section of the Act it was provided that any State might
                                assume, assess and collect its portion of the tax and pay the same
                                into the Treasury, and if thus paid on or before the last day of
                                June of the year for which it was levied, should entitle such State
                                to a deduction of fifteen per cent, of the gross amount to be paid
                                by such State. The section further provides that notice of the
                                intention of the State to assume and pay her portion of the tax,
                                without the intervention of the Federal officers, must be given to
                                the Secretary of the Treasury by the Governor, or other proper
                                officer, on or before the second Tuesday of February of each year in
                                which the tax is to be paid. The section also contains this proviso
                                : That the amount of direct tax apportioned to any State shall be
                                liable to be paid or satisfied in whole or in part by the release of
                                such State, duly executed to the United States, of any liquidated
                                and determined claim of any such State, of equal amount against the
                                United States ; Provided, that in case of such release, such State
                                shall be allowed the same abatement of the amount of such tax as
                                would be allowed in case of the. payment of the same in money.
                            From the very beginning of the war, the State was compelled to
                                advance large sums of money to equip and supply our volunteers, and,
                                in fact, furnished supplies of every kind until the Fall of 1861,
                                and it was believed shortly after the passage of that act, that our
                                advances, over" and above all reimbursements, would soon be
                                sufficient in amount to set-off the amount of tax apportioned
                                against the State Accordingly I opened a correspondence with the
                                Secretary of the Treasury on the subject, and ascertained from him
                                that the advances made by the State on behalf of our troops would be
                                regarded as a "claim'' within the spirit and meaning of the Act, and
                                would bs admitted in payment of the tax to an amount which should be
                                found due on settlement. After consultation with the Auditor,
                                Treasurer and Secretary of State, and in conjunction with them, on
                                the------ day of December, 1861, I filed in the office of the
                                Secretary of the Treasury at Washington, a paper officially signed,
                                of which a copy is herewith transmitted, in which we assumed that
                                the State would pay her portion of the direct tax without the
                                intervention of Federal officers, and proposing to set-off against
                                the same a like sum due to the State for advances made in furnishing
                                our troops, and to release the United States from further liability
                                for the sum thus set-off and advanced against the tax. This paper
                                was accepted by the Secretary of the Treasury, who thereupon
                                declined to appoint the officers provided by the law to collect the
                                tax within the State. On the ------- of January, 1862, Mr. Lange,
                                the Auditor of the State, proceeded to Washington with the papers
                                and vouchers embracing our claims against the Government up to the
                                time, for the purpose, of making settlement. He found, however, that
                                the mode of settlement with the several States had not been,
                                determined upon by the Treasury Department, and that the press of
                                business in the Department was such as to prevent the taking up of
                                our accounts. He was directed to file them in the Department to be
                                taken up for adjustment whenever they could be reached. It then
                                became obvious that our accounts would not be settled and adjusted
                                by the last day of June, 1861, so as to be "liquidated and
                                determined" within the meaning of the Act of Congress, as before
                                quoted, and that, after all, our set-off against the tax was about
                                to fail.
                            Accordingly, I brought the matter to the attention of our
                                Congressional delegation, and asked them to procure, if possible,
                                such legislation as would facilitate the settlement of our accounts,
                                and if that could not be done, to procure the extension of the time
                                in which accounts could be filed and settlements made, so that the
                                advantage of the set-off need not be lost. After much trouble and
                                delay, they procured the passage of an Act, which was approved on
                                the 13th day of May, 1862, the concluding part of which is as
                                follows: "Provided, that in case of such release, such State,
                                Territory or District shall be allowed the same abatement of the
                                amount of such Tax as would be allowed in case of the payment of the
                                same money," shall be construed as applying to such claims of States
                                for reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in enrolling,
                                subsisting, clothing, supplying arming, equipping, paying and
                                transporting its troops employed in aiding to suppress the present
                                insurrection against the United States, as shall be filed with the
                                proper officers of the United States before the thirtieth of July
                                next. And in such cases the abatement of fifteen per centum shall be
                                made on such portion of said tax as may be paid by the allowance of
                                such claims, in whole of in part, the same as if the final
                                settlement and liquidation thereof had been made before the
                                thirtieth of June."
                            This act healed the difficulty and under it we have filed with the
                                proper officers, anterior to the 30th of July, 1862, claims against
                                the United States, due to the State, more than enough to cover the
                                amount of tax due from the State, after deducting the fifteen per
                                cent, from the gross amount.
                            By this operation, the State has saved fifteen per cent, of the
                                original amount which is $135,731 80, reducing the amount from
                                $904,875 33 to $765,144 03, and the latter sum is set-off and paid
                                by our advances. The arrangement is mutually advantageous to the
                                State and General Government. It would do the Government no good to
                                draw a large amount of money from the people of the State for taxes,
                                while she was debtor to the State to a still larger amount, which
                                indebtedness must sometime be paid by money raised by taxation.
                                Besides this, the Government was in no condition to reimburse the
                                State in the full amount of her advances, and if these advances were
                                not used to pay the direct tax, the tax must have been collected
                                from the people of Indiana immediately, while the advances would, in
                                all probability, remain as a suspended debt for years to come, on
                                which the Government, if it followed former precedents, would pay no
                                interest. I respectfully recommend that the Legislature approve my
                                action, and that of the State Officers, in the premises.
                             This subject was laid before the Legislature at its last session,
                                but no action was taken in reference to it. The settlement of our
                                accounts with the Govern- [Govern]ment has progressed slowly, owing to the imperfection of
                                many of the vouchers, growing out of the haste with which the
                                business was done, and the inexperience of the officers in the
                                beginning of the war. At the request of the Department I have made
                                arrangements to send an Agent to Washington to cooperate with the
                                accounting officers of the Government, and anticipate bat little
                                trouble in bringing the settlement to a speedy and successful
                                issue.
                        
                        
                             BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS. 
                            The late Legislature adjourned without racing formal appropriations
                                for the suppott of the Benevolent Institutions, and the
                                Penitentiaries. Without attempting to enter into the history of the
                                transactions of that body, or the causes which led to its
                                disruption, it is enough to say that it was so constituted, and
                                adjourned under such circumstances, as for ba[?]e the i[?]ea of
                                harmonious and beneficial action to the State, should it be
                                re-assembled in extra session. The Auditor and Treasurer promptly
                                decided that no money could be drawn from the treasury for the
                                support of these institutions, because of the absence of legal
                                appropriations for that purpose. To this conclusion I offered no
                                objection, although in my own opinion, an appropnation for the
                                support of the Benevolent Institutions was the clear legal result of
                                the constitutional provision, and the statutes, creating them and
                                providing for their support; and it is very certain that had the
                                same liberal construction been adopted in regard to them, and the
                                Penitentiaries, that was extended to the payment of the State
                                Printer, they would all have been supported from the treasury.
                            As the matter stood, the operations of all these institutions-unless
                                it was the Southern Penitentiary --must have been suspended, or I
                                must procure moneys outside the treasury, with which to carry them
                                forward. This I determined to do if possible. The honor and humanity
                                of the State demanded that the operations of the Benevolent
                                Institutions should not again be suspended, and the peace and
                                security of the people of the State required that the convicts in
                                the Penitentiaries should not be turned loose upon society before
                                their time. The financial report will show that I was generously
                                sustained by the consituted authorities of various counties, by many
                                private persons, and by one railroad corporation, to all of whom I
                                desire in the most public manner to return my thanks. The money thus
                                obtained, added to the profits of the State Arsenal, was sufficient
                                to to support the Benevolent Institutions, and Penitentiaries, and
                                defray all other civil expenses, from the time the duty of providing
                                for them devolved upon me uitil the first day of January, 1865,
                                leaving a balance of the civil fund, in my hands of $8,768 95.
                            The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Benevolent
                                Institutions are herewith laid before you, from which it will
                                appear, that when the high process of all articles that enter in o
                                their consumption are considered, that they have been carred on with
                                more economy, and at less cost, than at any former period in their
                                history. This statement I am advised is fully sustained by a careful
                                examination and comparison of the reports of their expenditures from
                                the time of their first establishment.
                        
                        
                             PENITENTIARIES. 
                            The Northern Prison, located at Michigan City, is the one with which
                                I have had most to do. It has, I believe, been well and economically
                                managed, for which much credit is due to its Warden, Thomas Wood,
                                Esq., and to its Board of Trustees. In this connection I beg leave
                                to call the attention of the Legislature to the remarks in my former
                                message in reference to the construction of that Prison, and the
                                debt contracted for the building of shops in 1862.
                            "At the regular session of the Legislature in 1861, the sum of 10,000
                                dollars was appropriated for the purchase of materials and
                                construction of the Northern Prison, located at Michigan city, for
                                the year 1861, and a like sum for the year 1862. At the extra
                                session in 1861, the sum of 30,000 was appropriated for material and
                                construction of the Northern Prison, and for the support of
                                convicts, and the payment of the expenses incurred for the month of
                                January, 1861.
                            "At the same session a law was passed for the transfer of 200
                                convicts from the Southern Prison, at Jeffersonville, to the
                                Northern Prison, but no provision was made for their return in case
                                their labor should not be required. At the same session an act was
                                passed providing that all persons sent to the Penitentiaries from
                                counties north of the National Road should be confined in the
                                Northern Prison. The work in the construction of the Prison was
                                vigorously pressed in the summer and fall of 1861, and it was found
                                necessary, by the Board of Directors, in order to keep the convict
                                labor employed, to anticipate, and draw upon the appropriation made
                                for the construction of the Prison in 1862 ; so that when the work
                                for the year 1861 was closed up, there remained unexpended of the
                                fund appropriated for the construction of the Prison in 1862, but
                                about 3,000 dollars. It was apparent, then, that the labor of the
                                convicts could not be employed in the construction of the Prison
                                during the year 1862, for the want of means with which to purchase
                                the necessary materials. The labor of the convicts could not be
                                leased or hired out to contractors for the want of shops in the
                                prison in which they could be employed. To work the convicts out of
                                prison and about the town, would be so expensive, in the employment
                                of guards, as to make their labor unprofitable, beside there was no
                                authority for doing so, except as connected with the construction of
                                the Prison.
                            "As the matter stood, it was inevitable that the convict labor should
                                be almost wholly unemployed throughout the year 1862, and must so
                                continue until the prison shops were constructed; when the labor
                                might be hired to contractors, as in other prisons. If the shops
                                were constructed in 1862, this labor could be made remunerative
                                through the year 1863, but if not constructed until 1863, this could
                                not happen until 1864. It was evident that the State would sustain a
                                great loss by the delay in the construction of the shops, and
                                accordingly the Board of Directors convened in this city in February
                                last, and myself and other State officers were invited to be present
                                for consultation; and after full consideration of the subject, it
                                was believed by all to be clearly to the interest of the State that
                                the work of construction of the shops should be commenced at the
                                earliest moment, provided the contract could be let at fair prices,
                                and the contractor, being fully advised of the condition of affairs,
                                should be willing to await the action of the Legislature for his
                                pay. The Board of Directors then proceeded to advertise for
                                proposals for the work, and a public letting was had. I directed Mr.
                                John B. Stumph, of this city, reputed to be an honest and capable
                                builder, to be present at the letting, and see that the contract was
                                properly made, and in accordance with the plans and specifications
                                before that time adopted by the State for the construction of the
                                shops. The contract, I have every reason to believe, was fairly
                                made, upon terms, as I am informed, fifteen per cent below the
                                original contract for the same work, and at least twenty per cent,
                                below what the same work could new be let for in cash.-- The shops
                                have been completed, and Mr. Stumph was again directed to examine
                                and measure the work; his report of the letting, quality and
                                measurement of the work is herewith submitted. In view of the early
                                completion of the shops, the Board of Directors were able to lease
                                the labor of the convicts upon terms highly favorable to the State.
                                This business is a proper subject for Legislative investigation,
                                which I hope will be promptly made, and that meats will be speedily
                                provided to pay the contractor the amount which shall be found to'be
                                honestly due."
                            To what I have here said, I will only add that the shops, the
                                construction of which I authorized in 1862, would now cost at least
                                seventy-five percent, more than the price for which they were
                                Contracted, and that without them the convict labor of the prison
                                could not have been made available. Justice requires that an
                                appropriation to pay for them should be made without delay.
                        
                        
                             MILITARY EXPENDITURES. 
                            Upon the adjournment of the Legislature I found myself unprovided,
                                with the exception of a small balance of the military contingent
                                fund, with money or appropriations for military purposes. New
                                regiments could not be raised under the requisitions  of the Government, nor recruiting
                                carried forward, without the use of large sums of money. The Legion
                                had received no pay for their services from the beginning of the
                                war, and the organization could not be successfully continued unless
                                payment was made, and the men reimbursed for their actual
                                expenditures, for which the appropriation for the Legion fund, made
                                in 1861, was inadequate. The Southern border was still disturbed by
                                threats and danger of invasion, and such steps were to be taken, if
                                possible, as would guaranty peace and security to our people. In
                                this dilemma, I determined to apply to the President for an advance
                                under an appropriation made by Congress, on the 31st of July, 1861,
                                which act is in these words :
                            "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
                                    Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress
                                    assembled, That the sum of two millions of dollars be, and
                                the same is hereby appropriated, to be expended, under the direction
                                of the President of the United States, in supplying and defraying
                                the expenses of transporting and delivering such arms and munitions
                                of war, and in his judgment may be expedient and proper, to place in
                                the hands of any of the loyal citizens residing in any of the
                                States, of which "the inhabitants are in rebellion against the
                                Government of the United States, or in which the rebellion is, or
                                may be threatened, and likewise for defraying such expenses as may
                                be properly incurred, in organizing and sustaining, while so
                                organized, any of said citizens into companies, battalions,
                                regiments, or otherwise, for their own protection against domestic
                                violence, insurrection, invasion, or rebellion."
                            After a full consideration of the condition of affairs in Indiana,
                                the President advanced to me, as a disbursing officer, out of said
                                appropriation, the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
                                ($250,000). It will be perceived that this money was not paid to me
                                as a loan to the State, or an advance to the State upon debts due to
                                her from the General Government, and creates no debt against the
                                State whatever, but that in theory it is an expenditure made by the
                                President through me as his disbursing agent -- It has, however,
                                been disbursed exclusively in the name and for the benefit of the
                                State, in the payment of necessary military expenses, for which the
                                State should have made ample appropriations. I have advanced to the
                                Paymaster of the State forces, at different times, the sum of
                                $171,661 88, of which the greater portion, however, has been
                                reimbursed to me by the General Government, upon my filing in the
                                proper Department the receipted pay-roll of the Indiana Legion, for
                                services rendered in the war. For a detailed account of the
                                expenditures of the military fund, the Legislature is referred to
                                the financial report of Hon. W. H. H. Terrell, Financial Secretary,
                                which is herewith submitted, and to the vouchers on file in this
                                Department. All of these expenditures were laid before the Auditing
                                Committee , appointed by the late Legislature, for examination, and
                                received their approval. As will be shown by the report, I had on
                                hand on the 1st day of January, 1865, of the military fund, the sum
                                of $115,487 28, and the question is now presented as to the proper
                                method of settlement with the Government for this fund. One of two
                                ways may be adopted. First, by returning to the
                                Government the balance of the fund unexpended, and by settling with
                                it for the amount expended, upon vouchers of expenditures, after the
                                same shall have been approved by the Legislature, and this Would be
                                in accordance with the theory upon which the money was originally
                                advanced by the President; Second, by paying into
                                the State Treasury the unexpended part of the fund, and treating the
                                whole as an advance to the State, to be accounted for by her in her
                                general settlement with the Government for advances made. This
                                latter plan is, in my judgment, more consonant with justice and the
                                honor of the State, the money having been expended for purposes for
                                which the State was honorably and patriotically bound to make
                                provision.

                            In conclusion on this subject, I respectfully request that a Joint
                                Committee of the two Houses be speedily appointed to investigate the
                                civil and military expenditures I have made since the adjournment of
                                the last legislature, and to examine the vouchers for the same on
                                file in my Department, and that the Legislature will make prompt
                                provision for the repayment of the money I have borrowed for public
                                purposes. It was advanced from patriotic motives, with a full
                                reliance upon the good faith of the State for its reimbursement, and
                                without it the machinery of the State Government could not have been
                                kept in motion.
                            I appointed the Hon. W. H. H. Terrell as Financial Secretary, and
                                placed under his care and management the examination and settlement
                                of all accounts. He deserves great credit for the ability and
                                success with which he has conducted the business, and I desire in
                                this public manner to express to him my thanks for his services. His
                                report is herewith submitted as an accompanying document.
                        
                        
                             INTEREST ON THE STATE DEBT. 
                            Shortly after the Legislature adjourned, the question was sprung as
                                to the existence of legal appropriations for the payment of the
                                interest upon the public debt, and the opinion of Mr. Hord, Attorney
                                General, was published, denying their existence and any power to
                                withdraw the money from the treasury to pay the interest, which
                                opinion was endorsed and acted upon by Mr. Ristine, Auditor of
                                State. Believing that the question had its origin in political
                                considerations, and that there was little room to doubt as to the
                                legal right and duty of the Treasurer to remit the money to New York
                                to pay the interest, I at once took issue with these gentlemen. The
                                State had failed to pay the interest upon her bonds from 1842 to
                                1846, during which time she acquired a reputation for repudiation
                                and bankruptcy, from which she only recovered after many years of
                                faithful discharge of her obligations. The dark cloud which had thus
                                been placed upon her financial character had seriously retarded her
                                growth in wealth and population,by deterring emigration from her
                                borders. In 1846 she effected a compromise with most of her
                                creditors by the transfer of the Wabash and Erie Canal for one half
                                of the debt, and the issuing of new stocks for the other half, upon
                                which she solemnly pledged herself to pay the interest semi
                                annually. This pledge, and the legislation had in pursuance of the
                                compromise, was treated by Governor Whitcomb and the various
                                officers of State, as a valid appropriation of the money necessary
                                to pay the interest under the old constitution, which, upon this
                                subject, is like the present. In 1850, the framers of the new
                                Constitution by the 20th section of the 10th article, solemnly
                                ratified this contract with the bondholders by appropriating all the
                                revenue of the State, derived from taxation for general State
                                purposes, after defraying the ordinary expenses of the State
                                Government, to the payment of the interest and the liquidation of
                                the principal of the public debt. It was clearly the purpose of the
                                new Constitution to place the credit of the State beyond the
                                contingency of dishonor by acts of omission or prohibition on the
                                part of the Legislature. Under the new Constitution further
                                legislation to pay the interest was not deemed necessary, and this
                                construction was acted upon by all administrations down to 1863;
                                although, perhaps in one case, a formal appropriation was made,
                                without any definite purpose. An action for a mandamus against the
                                Auditor was commenced by Mr.W. H. Talbott, President of the Sinking
                                Fund Board, for the avowed purpose of having the question settled,
                                which was carried through the Circuit and Supreme Courts, and
                                resulted in a decision by the latter against the existence of an
                                appropriation. Without intending any disrespect to the eminent
                                tribunal by which this case was decided, I must be permitted to
                                observe  that the history of its
                                origin, progress and conclusion, was such as to deprive it of any
                                moral influence, and that the principles upon which the decis-sion
                                was made have been since openly disregarded by the Auditor and
                                Treasurer of State in the payment of large sums of money to the
                                Public Printer.
                            But leaving out of view wholly who was right or wrong upon the legal
                                question, it was a matter of the first importance that the
                                obligations of the State should be promptly met, and her credit
                                rescued from the disaster of a new dishonor. It had received a shock
                                in the discovery and exposure of the Stover forgery of our State
                                stocks, amounting to nearly three millions of dollars, from the evil
                                consequences of which it was relieved only by a determined effort on
                                the part of the State authorities to bring the criminals to justice.
                                No argument was required to prove that should it again become
                                impaired by a serious failure upon the part of the State to meet her
                                engagements, it could not be restored during this generation, and
                                the progress of the State in wealth and population would receive a
                                serious check. Determined, if possible, to avert the threatened
                                calamity, I went to New York and laid the whole matter before the
                                house of Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co., with the request that
                                they should advance the amount necessary to pay the interest, until
                                such time as the Treasury might be unlocked, and the money obtained
                                therefrom. My request was generously met, and after full
                                consideration, acceded to, provided a correct list of the
                                stockholders could be obtained. It is proper to state that in making
                                this arrangement no stipulation was asked for or given, in regard to
                                the compensation they should receive for the use of their money, and
                                the risk and trouble they should incur; but the whole matter was
                                referred to the future action and good faith of the State, They at
                                once notified John C. Walker, Agent of State, of their readiness to
                                pay the interest, and asked him to furnish from his books a list of
                                the stockholders, for the making out of which they offered to pay.
                                This he peremptorily refused, and denied access to his books, from
                                which they desired to copy the list. They then proposed to him that
                                he should pay the interest in the usual way, upon his own books,
                                agreeing to honor his checks issued therefor, at the same time
                                exonerating him from all personal liabilities for any moneys so
                                paid. This offer was likewise refused. The correspondence between
                                Winslow, Lanier & Co., and Walker, upon this subject, is
                                herewith submitted for your consideration. As Messrs Winslow, Lanier
                                & Co. would not take the responsibility of paying, in the
                                absence of a correct list, owing to the existence of a large amount
                                of spurious stocks, which otherwise they had no means of detecting,
                                the interest, which fell due on the first day of July, 1863, went
                                unpaid.
                            Determined not to be defeated, if possible, in the effort to preserve
                                the credit of the State, I attempted to secure from other sources a
                                correct list; of the stockholders, and in this attempt succeeded in
                                November. In the mean time the necessity for action had become more
                                manifest and imperative than before. While the American stockholders
                                had a correct knowledge of the state of affairs, and but few stocks
                                were changing hands or being offered in the market, the case was
                                quite different with our stockholders in Europe. In Europe, American
                                politics are always badly understood, and the principal fact which
                                they clearly comprehended was, that they did not receive their
                                interest. They associated this failure with that of 1841, and began
                                to say that there was some strange fatality attending Indiana
                                securities, and declared their intention of sending them back to
                                America and getting clear of them at once and forever. Such a
                                measure would have given the State a bad name abroad, seriously
                                affecting emigration to her borders, and would have been followed by
                                great depreciation and loss of credit throughout the United
                                States.
                            Having presented the list to Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co., they
                                promptly renewed their offer, and gave public notice that they would
                                pay the back interest which fell due in July, and afterward gave
                                farther notice that they would pay the interest accrued on the 1st
                                day of January, 1864, the 1st day of July, 1864, and the 1st day of
                                January, 1865, and up o the 31st of November last, as I am advised,
                                had paid out $416,677 08. How much they have paid since the 1st of
                                January, 1865, I am not advised, but presume it will make the
                                aggregate as much as $575,000. The noble and generous conduct of
                                this house should and will be appreciated by the people of Indiana;
                                and Mr. Lanier, in his clear comprehension and able management of
                                the affair, has displayed not only financial ability, but a broad
                                statesmanship not often exhibited in financial affairs.
                            I trust that the generous confidence which he has reposed in the good
                                faith of the people of Indiana, will not be disappointed, and that
                                the Legislature will hasten to reimburse him for the money he has
                                expended, and indemnify him for the use of it, and for the trouble
                                he has incurred.
                            In conclusion upon this subject, I am glad to be able to say that the
                                credit of the State has been fully preserved, and that her stocks
                                now command a higher price relatively in the market, when compared
                                with the stocks of other States bearing like interest, than at any
                                former period in her history.
                            John K. Gapin, Esq., who was Clerk in the office of the State Agent,
                                during the incumbency of Col. E. N. Hudson, was appointed by me to
                                prepare the books and make the payment of the interest on the State
                                debt, at the banking house of Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co., and
                                under their general direction and supervision. He has performed that
                                duty with ability, and to the satisfaction of all parties, and thus
                                far without compensation. I recommend that provision be made to pay
                                him liberally for his valuable services.
                        

                        
                             STATE DEBT AND SINKING FUND. 
                            The subjects of the State Debt and Sinking Fund, will be reserved for
                                a special common cation to the Legislature at another time.
                        
                        
                             EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT. 
                            The labors in the Executive Department have been greatly increased by
                                the war, and by the peculiar condition of the State Government for
                                the last two years. The force which I have employed is small
                                compared with the amount of work which has been done. Much
                                responsibility has been devolved upon the Financial and Military
                                Secretaries, and their labors have been most arduous. Col. Wm. H
                                Schlater has performed the duties of Military Secretary for more
                                than three years with marked ability and fidelity, and to the
                                satisfaction of myself and the army. Capt. Geo. H. West and Capt.
                                John M. Commons have performed with efficiency and to my entire
                                satisfaction the labors appertaining to their desks Col. John C.
                                New, an able and efficient officer, has succeeded to the place held
                                by Col. Terrell, who has been appointed Adjutant General, which
                                office had been most ably filled by Gen Laz Noble.

                        
                        
                             ELECTIONS AND CONSPIRACIES. 
                            While engaged in a civil war of gigantic proportions, a presidential
                                election has quietly taken place, its results have been peaceably
                                and readily acquiesced in, and the bitterness and personal
                                animosities which are usually engendered in such a contest, have
                                passed away as speedily and perfectly as at any former period in our
                                history. The ability of the people to come together under swell
                                circumstances, and peaceably elect a chief magistrate, has been
                                regarded alike by the friends and enemies of republican institutions
                                as the great test of their capacity for self-government, and
                                accordingly we find that the result of the late elections has made a
                                profound impression throughout the old world, and has given renewed
                                assurances of the perpetuity of our Government.
                            I congratulate you on the returning harmony of the people of our
                                State, and that the dangers which threatened us with internal
                                dissensions, have apparently passed away. Some misguided persons who
                                mistook the bitterness of party for patriotism, and ceased to feel
                                the obligations of allegiance to our country and Government,
                                conspired against the State and National Governments, and sought by
                                military force to plunge us into the horrors of revolution. A secret
                                organization had been formed, which by its lectures and ritual ,
                                inculcated doctrines subversive of the Government, and which,
                                carried to their consequences, would evidently result in the
                                disruption and destruction of the nation. The mem-  bers of this organization were united
                                by solemn paths, which, if observed, bound them to execute the
                                orders of their Grand Commanders without de-Jay or question, however
                                treasonable or criminal might be their character. I am glad to
                                believe that the great majority of its members regarded it merely as
                                a political machine, and did not suspect the ulterior treasonable
                                action contemplated by its leaders, and upon the discovery of its
                                true character, hastened to abjure all connection with it. Borne of
                                the chief conspirators have been arrested and tried by the
                                Government, and others have fled; their schemes have been exposed
                                and baffled, and we may reasonably hope that our State may not
                                hereafter be end angered and dishonored by the removal of these
                                insane and criminal designs.
                        
                        
                             THE WAR. 
                            We are in the midst of a bloody civil war, forced upon the Government
                                by the rebellious inhabitants of certain States. The theory upon
                                which this war was begun was the pretended right of a State to
                                withdraw from the Union whenever its rights under the Constitution
                                of the United States were violated, of which violation it had the
                                exclusive power to judge and determine. This claim was founded upon
                                the dogma, that the Union was a compact of sovereign and independent
                                States, to which they were parties in their municipal character;
                                that the United States were not a nation, but an aggregation of
                                nationalities united in a co-partnership for certain purposes, and
                                upon certain conditions, which were contained in the articles of
                                co-partnership known as the Federal Constitution. The exercise of
                                the right of secession, or withdrawal from the Union, was justified
                                by the allegation that the people of the Northern States had
                                violated their constitutional obligations by refusing to capture or
                                permit to be captured in their midst, fugitive Slaves escaping from
                                their masters, and by various other acts of hostility to the
                                institution of slavery; and by the further declaration that there
                                was good reason to believe that the Government of the United States,
                                under the administration of Mr. Lincoln, would perform acts of
                                violence subversive of the prosperity and even the existence of
                                slavery. To have conceded the right claimed, and permitted any
                                number of States peaceably to withdraw from the Union, would have
                                involved not only the destruction of the Government, but the
                                absolute dissolution of the Nation,breaking it into as many
                                fragments as there are States, each claiming sovereignty and
                                independence as to all the others. When the war was begun,
                                therefore, there was but one of two things for the Government to do,
                                either to suppress the rebellion and assert its integrity as a
                                Nation, or to abdicate its authority and confess itself without
                                right to enforce its decrees and perpetuate its existence, by
                                conceding the want of national unity and the right of secession. It
                                must be admitted that between these two there was no middle ground,
                                and the Government was forced at once to a choice between national
                                life and national death, the life only to be preserved by the total
                                suppression of the rebellion that menaced it. Between these
                                contending theories there could, in the nature of the case, be no
                                compromise, as they were utterly antagonistic and irreconcilable.
                                The rebellion was begun upon an alleged right upon which it must
                                stand or fall, and was resisted by the Government upon the ground
                                that its own life could not be preserved, if the existence of this
                                right were in any manner or to any extent conceded. 
                            It is hardly worth while to consider what would be our condition if
                                this rebellion were successful. The most thoughtless or stupid mind
                                cannot tail to perceive that the several States, fragments of a once
                                happy and powerful republic, could not live together in prosperity
                                and peace; but that war following upon war, anarchy and the
                                destruction of personal liberty, would inevitably result, to be
                                succeeded by the night of despotism, burying in utter darkness the
                                fair hopes and glorious prospects which once illuminated our
                                national horizon. Whatever it may cost us to preserve the Union, we
                                may be assured it will cost us everything to lose it. A refusal to
                                prosecute the war because it is expensive, would not be unlike the
                                case of a man who should resolve to die because the employment of a
                                physician would embarrass his financial affairs. Nor would it be
                                less absurd to refuse to sustain the Government and prosecute the
                                war, upon the pretence that by so doing constitutional, rights and
                                personal liberty would be endangered, when we know perfectly well
                                that if the rebellion succeeds, civil and religious liberty and
                                constitutional rights, of whatever kind, will be overwhelmed in one
                                common ruin.
                            Let us hope that human slavery, which has ever been the source of
                                national dissensions and heart burnings; which from the beginning
                                has arrayed our people into classes, and fretted them into mutual
                                hatreds; and for the preservation and prosperity of which it has
                                been solemnly avowed that this mighty war and most bloody rebellion
                                were begun and are prosecuted; has received its mortal wound, and
                                will soon be consigned to the comman grave of loathsome tyrannies,
                                from which there is no resurrection. Should the Congress of the
                                United States pass a joint resolution to prohibit slavery, or
                                involuntary servitude throughout the United States. I do most
                                earnestly hope that the people of the several States will hasten to
                                give it their solemn sanction, so that it may pass into our
                                fundamental law and go out to all the world, that our country is in
                                fact, as in name, "the land of the free," as well as "the home of
                                the brave." O. P. MORION.
                            The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen, the object of this session being
                                accomplished, the Convention is adjourned sine

                            And then--Senators having retired--

                                9 o'clock. 
                            The Special Committee on Rules, announced by the
                                SPEAKER yesterday, namely, Messrs. Branham, Higgins, Dunham, Buskirk

                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        SATURDAY, January 7, 1865.
                    
                    On motion by Mr. MASON, the reading of yesterday's journal was dispensed
                        with.
                    Mr. VAN BUSKIRK offered the following resolution, which was adopted:
                    
                        
                            
                                Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns, it
                                    adjourn I to meet on Monday next at 2 P. M.
                            
                        
                    


                    
                         AN ADDITIONAL PAGE. 
                        Mr. GIFFORD offered the following:

                            Door-keeper.
                        The motion was agreed to.

                        The roll having been called--
                        The PRESIDENT, pro tem, announced four absentees, and
                            directed the acting Door-keeper to bring to the bar of the Senate,
                            Messrs. English and Hanna--Mr. Brown, of Wells, being excused on account
                            of severe lameness, and Mr. Douglas represented as absent from the
                            city.
                    


                    
                         ABSENCE. 
                        Mr. WILLIAMS asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Downey, from and
                            after today.
                    


                    
                         STATIONERY. 
                        Mr. HORD offered the following resolution,  (--the Senate passing over informally the
                            pending call)--which was adopted:

                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                        appointed to devise and report some suitable mode of
                                        providing stationery for the members and officers of the
                                        Senate.
                                
                            
                        

                    
                    
                         JOINT CONVENTION. 
                        A message was received from the House of Representatives announcing the
                            passage by that body of the following resolution:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate be invited to
                                        attend in this Hall on Monday, the 9th of January, at 2
                                        o'clock P. M., for the purpose of opening and publishing the
                                        returns of the election for Governor and Lieutenant
                                        Governor.
                                
                            
                        
                        Subsequently, on motion of Mr. DOWNEY, the resolution was taken up and
                            concurred in by the Senate.
                    

                    
                         RULES-SESSION HOURS. 
                        Mr. WILLIAMS, from the select committee thereon, reported Rules for the
                            government of the Senate similar to those of the last session.
                        Mr. CASON moved to refer the report back to the committee with
                            instructions to report an amendment so that the President shall take his
                            seat and call the Senate to order at 2 o'clock p. M., of each day,
                            unless the Senate adjourn to another hour.
                        Mr. DOWNEY favored the motion to re-commit.
                        Mr. BENNETT named many good and substantial reasons why the Senate should
                            have no session in the forenoon.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK insisted that members could be able to vote more
                            intelligibly on all questions after they shall be canvassed in the
                            committee room. No suggestion has been made in this chamber during the
                            present session which was so gratifying to him. He hoped the motion
                            would prevail.
                        Mr. CORBIN could see no inconvenience arising from the rule requiring the
                            sessions to commence at 9 o'clock; on the contrary, he could readily see
                            how we would waste a good deal of precious time by having the hour for
                            our meetings fixed at 2 o'clock. Under the present rule committees can
                            have all the time they need, simply by asking for it.
                        Mr. DOWNEY offered as a substitute for the motion to recommit, an
                            amendment to the report of the Committee on Rules,
                            which would fix the daily session hours at 2 o'clock P. M.
                        Mr. CASON accepted the amendment as a substitute for his motion.
                        Messrs. WILLIAMS and OYLER opposed the amendment.
                        Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Mason in the chair), favored the change proposed, for
                            the reason that practical results in legislation would inevitably flow
                            from it. He disliked to go out after night to the meetings of
                            committees; and he knew of many members here now, who always did much
                            more work in the committee rooms, when caught there, than in the Senate
                            chamber. It would facilitate the passage of measures recommended by
                            committees, because members would understand that the recommendations
                            had been well and cautiously considered. If we find it does not work
                            well, we can make a change.
                        Mr. DOWNEY replied to the objection named by Messrs. Williams, Corbin and
                            Oyler, and endeavored to show conclusively that more work could be done
                            in this body by giving up the forenoon for the committee meetings than
                            by holding sessions of the Senate.
                        Mr. NILES hoped no additional remarks would be necessary in favor of this
                            proposition. He certainly thought the change proposed is the very best
                            that could be made. A committee could consider more dispassionately any
                            proposition than it can be done in the Senate proper. He did not desire
                            to be compelled to sit here six hours every day and then go to a
                            committtee room after dark. The Senate can certainly act more
                            understandingly on every question that shall first be considered in the
                            committee room.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS insisted that he had never experienced any inconvenience
                            from the rule as he had submitted it in the committee report.
                        Mr. BENNETT again set forth the great value of the proposed
                            amendment.
                        The amendment was then rejected by yeas 23, nays 26.
                        The committee report was concurred in by consent.

                    

                    
                         STANDING COMMITTEES. 
                        Mr. McCLURG offered the following:



                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, The political parties in this
                                        Senate are equally divided; and whereas, the question of
                                        contested seats ought to be settled upon a just and proper
                                        basis, and it is desirable to organize a committee on
                                        elections, which shall, as near as possible, give
                                        satisfaction to the Senate; therefore.
                                    Resolved, That the Hon. Paris G. Dunning be
                                        declared chairman of said committee.
                                    Resolved, That the President in appointing
                                        the remaining members of said committee be requested to
                                        divide them equally politically.
                                
                            
                        



                        Mr. DUNNING said he desired to be relieved from the operation of the
                            resolution adopted yesterday afternoon, requiring him to appoint the
                            Standing Committees.
                        Mr. COBB favored the passage of the resolution.
                        Mr. WEIGHT and Mr. PEDEN were opposed to the resolution, because it
                            proposes to dictate as to the arrangement of the Standing Committees of
                            the Senate.
                        Mr. THOMPSON was glad to see Governor Dunning disposed to decline the
                            labor imposed upon him by the resolution of yesterday evening.
                        Mr. McCLURG could see no objection to the resolution, and urged its
                            immediate passage.
                        Mr. BENNETT was willing to see Governor Dunning chairman of the
                                Committee on Elections, but would oppose the
                            passage of the resolution.
                        Mr. CULLEN could see no necessity for the adoption of the resolution, and
                            looked upon it as casting a reflection on the Lieutenant Governor, who
                            is expected to preside over this body during the remainder of the
                            session.
                        Mr. McCLURG withdrew the resolution.



                    
                    
                         PRINTING THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. 
                        Mr. THOMPSON offered the following resolution, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That ten thousand copies of the
                                        massage of His Excellency, Governor Morton, be printed for
                                        the use of the Senate.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         OFFICIAL HARDSHIPS. 
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK presented a petition from three Township Assessors in
                            Decatur county, praying for the
                            enactment of a law providing additional compensation to said class of
                            officers, which was read and laid on the table.
                    


                    
                         COUNTY AND OTHER BONDS. 
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, his Bond Bill, [S. 3,] (introduced yesterday
                            morning,) was read the second time.
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, it was referred to a select committee of five,
                            which the PRESIDENT subsequently made to consist of Messrs. Cobb,
                            Bennett, Downey, Allison, and Gaff.
                    
                    
                         A NEW PROPOSITION. 
                        Mr. HORD introduced a bill [S. 12] authorizing creditors in certain cases
                            to bring action for their claims before they are due, which was read the
                            first time, and passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                         RAILROAD APPRAISEMENT. 
                        The PRESIDENT pro tem, announced the committee
                            authorized by Mr. Vawter's Railroad Appraisement, resolution adopted
                            just before the recess for dinner yesterday, viz: Messrs. Vawter,
                            Corbin, Culver, Peden, Hanna, Dykes, and Beeson.
                    

                    
                         THE DOOR-KEEPERS AGAIN. 
                        Mr. BROWN of Wells, moved that the Senate proceed to ballot for
                            Door-keeper.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        Mr. COBB nominated Frank Cunningham, of Marion county, for Principal
                            Door-keeper.
                        The twelfth ballot far Principal Door-keeper resulted as follows:

                        
                        
                            
                                

                                    Those who voted for John H. Johnson were:Messrs. Allison,
                                        Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Brown of Hamilton, Cason, Chapman,
                                        Culver, Davis, Dunning, Dykes. Hyatt, Milligan, Moore,
                                        Niles, Noyes, Oyler, Peden, Richmond, Terry, Thompson, Van
                                        Buskirk, Ward, Woods and Wright-25.
                                    Those who voted for Frank Cuaningham were:Messrs. Barker,
                                        Bowman, Bradley, Brown of Wells, Carson, Cobb, Corbin,
                                        Douglas, Downey, English, Finch, Fuller, Gaff, Gifford,
                                        Hanna, Hord, Jenkins, Marshall, Mason, MeClurg, Newlin.
                                        Staggs, and Williams-23.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. MOORE, when his name was called, said: I have been voting all the
                            time with my Democratic friends, but I see it is no use to vote with
                            them any longer. I want this thing to close up. I have come here to
                            serve my country in the best possible manner I know how to do. It seems
                            to me this thing ought to be closed to-day, so we can go to work Monday.
                            For that reason, seeing there is no possible chance for us to elect a
                            Democrat for I am a Democrat, and expect to die one but under these
                            considerations I shall vote this time for Mr. Johnson.
                        Mr. VAWTER, when his name was called, announced that he had paired of, on
                            all political questions, with Mr. Cullen.
                        The PRESIDENT declared Mr. John H. Johnson duly elected Principal
                            Door-keeper of the Senate during the present session; and thereupon
                            administered to him the oath of office.
                        Mr. BEESON moved that the Senate proceed to ballot for Assistant
                            Door-keeper.

                        The motion was agreed to.
                        Mr. BEESON nominated S. G. Thompson, of Wabash county, for Assistant
                            Door-keeper.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS nominated James S. Morgan, of Daviess county.
                        There being no other nominations the Secretary called the roll, and the
                            first ballot for Assistant Door-keeper resulted:
                            For Mr. Thompson 24 votes; for Mr. Morgan 24
                            votes.
                        There being no choice--
                        The PRESIDENT directed Senators to prepare their votes for a second
                            ballot.
                        Mr. BRADLEY nominated John D. Moore,. of Owen county, for Assistant
                            Doorkeeper.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS withdrew the name of James S. Morgan.
                        Mr. MOORE. If we all vote upon a political side we cannot come to any
                            conclusion at all. I call upon the friends on the other side as I have
                            voted with them and put the Principal Door-keeper in and I ask them to
                            go with us now. This is a son of mine, and I would like very much if the
                            Senate would allow him to stay with me this session. I think he will
                            make a faithful officer, and I appeal to the magnanimity, and more
                            particularly to my friend here, [Mr. Thompson] and the gentleman from
                            Monroe [Mr. Dunning.] I think the gentleman from Monroe said to me, that
                            the time might come when he would support my son for same office here. I
                            hope he will think the time hag come now. 
                        The second ballot for Assistant Door-keeper was then taken,
                            resulting: for Mr. Thompson 24 votes, for Mr.
                            Moore 22 votes, and for Mr. Morgan 2 votes. No choice.
                    

                    
                         PAY OF DOOR-KEEPER. 
                        Mr. COBB offered the following resolution, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That William H. Montgomery be,
                                        and he is hereby allowed the sum of six dollars per day, and
                                        mileage, for his services as Door-keeper of the Senate,
                                        during the present session.
                                
                            
                        
                    

                    
                         THE DOOR KEEPER, IMBROGLIO. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, nominated Frank Cunningham, of Marion county, for
                            Assistant Door-keeper.
                        Mr. BRADLEY withdrew the name of Mr. Moore.
                        
                        The third ballot resulted : for Mr. Thompson 24 votes, for Mr. Cunningham
                            24 votes. No choice.
                        Mr. CULVER made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. DOWNEY nominated Percy Rous, of Switzerland county, for Assistant
                            Door-keeper.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, withdrew the name of Mr. Cunningham.
                        Mr. DOWNEY said he should not act the partizan in performing his duties
                            upon this floor; and hoped gentlemen would not longer stand out against
                            the election of this veteran soldier to the smallest office in the gift
                            of the Senate.
                        
                        The fourth ballot for Assistant Door-keeper resulted: for Mr. Thompson 24
                            votes, for Mr. Rous 24 votes.
                        Mr. BENNET offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper be
                                        instructed to properly furnish the office rooms adjoining
                                        the Senate Chamber, for the use of the Senate. 
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    

                    
                         STANDING COMMITTEES. 
                        On motion by Mr. BEESON, the vote of yesterday afternoon, adopting the
                            resolution empowering the President pro tem, to
                            appoint the standing committees of the Senate, was reconsidered.
                        Mr. CORBIN then withdrew the resolution.
                    


                    
                         PAY OF DOOR-KEEPERS. 
                        Mr. MASON offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That each of the employees except
                                        pages employed by Mr. Montgomery, the acting Door-keeper, be
                                        allowed the sum of six dollars per day for the number of
                                        days they have served as Assistant Door-keepers.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion by Mr. MOORE, the resolution was amended so as to allow the
                            Pages three dollars per day.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend by striking out "$3," and inserting in lieu
                            thereof "$5."
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the resolution and pending amendment was
                            referred to a special committee. 
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    



                


                

                

                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                     SATURDAY, January 7, 1865.
                    House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    Journal of yesterday was read.
                    Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:

                    
                        
                            

                                Resolved, That the Senate be invited to attend
                                    in the hall of the House of Representatives on Monday, the 9th
                                    of January, at 3 o'clock P. M., for the purpose of opening and
                                    publishing the returns of the election of Governor and
                                    Lieutenant Governor.
                            
                        
                    


                    Mr. NEWCOMB suggested 2 o'clock, to give time for the inauguration
                        ceremonies. 
                    Mr. BRANHAM accepted the amendment, and so the resolution was adopted.
                    
                         REPRESENTATIVE FROM POSEY. 
                         Mr. BUSKIRK presented the credentials of Elijah M. Spencer, from the
                            county of Posey, whereupon Mr. Spencer came forward, was sworn and took
                            his seat.
                    
                    
                         PRIVILEGE OF HALL. 
                        Mr. WHITESIDE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Be it Resolved by the House of
                                            Representatives, That the soldiers of the War of
                                        the Revolution, of the War of 1812, of the Mexican War, and
                                        the War for the suppression of the Southern rebellion, who
                                        may he present in this city, be invited to the privilege of
                                        seat a within this Hall, whenever they are present during
                                        the session.
                                
                            
                        




                        Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to table the resolution.
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend by reading--" Outside of the bar of the
                            House," which was agreed to, and the question recurred on the resolution
                            as amended.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that the rules, which would doubtless be adopted,
                            would give the presiding officer of the House the right to extend this
                            privilege indefinitely. So far as he was concerned he was perfectly
                            willing to commit this question to the presiding officer, and no doubt
                            if any gentleman should be present in the course of the session who has
                            distinguished himself in any department of the Government, the courtesy
                            due him will be extended by the Speaker. But to pass a resolution of
                            this kind--to tender this privilege to too many persons, who have not
                            distinguished themselves in front, would be an invitation to abuse the
                            privilege. Any person has the privilege of the lobby, with such
                            accommodations as we have there; but as to the privilege of coming
                            within the bar he preferred to leave that to the discretion of the
                            presiding officer. 
                        The resolution as amended was rejected.
                    



                    
                         THE XIII ARTICLE. 
                        Mr. MEREDITH asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a pint
                            resolution. (No. 1) proposing an amendment of the Constitution, by
                            striking out the Thirteenth Article thereof, which was read the first
                            time and passed to the second reading. 
                    
                    
                         RAILROAD TARIFF. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Corporations be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of enacting passenger and freight tariff for the
                                        railroads of this State.
                                
                            
                        
                        Which was adopted. 

                    

                    
                         RULES. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. Speaker, I desire to inquire whether the
                                Committee on Stationery is ready to report ?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. We shall probably be ready to make a report on Monday
                            morning.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. I now move to take from the table the report of the
                                Committee on Rules. I think it will be better to dispose
                            of this matter at once. There are quite a number of members here for the
                            first time, and it is particularly due to them that our Rules should be
                            printed at as early a day as possible.
                        The motion was agreed to and report taken up.
                        The report recommends the adoption of the rules of the last session, with
                            one amendment prescribed in these reports yesterday, and the printing of
                            three hundred copies thereof, including the State Constitution. The
                            report was concurred in, and the printing ordered accordingly.
                    

                    
                         GOVERNOR'S SALARY. 
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, asked and obtained leave to introduce a bill (No.
                            1) to increase the salary of the Governor of the State, and to repeal
                            the first section of an act relative to the salaries of public officers,
                            and providing for the manner of paying the same, and the manner of
                            reimbursing the State for the increase of salaries, approved March 5,
                            1860, chapter 146 R. S.
                        Which was read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK presented the credentials of Elward T. Sullivan,
                            Representative from Posey and Vanderburg, and he, coming forwards
                            received the oath and took his seat.
                        Mr. GREGORY moved to suspend the constitutional provision requiring the
                            reading of a bill on three several days before its passage, to enable
                            him to move the consideration of his bill on its passage to the third
                            reading; and the yeas and nays thereon, (being also a constitutional
                            requirement) were ordered and taken, resulting--yeas 58, nays 39--as
                            follows :

                                    NAYS--Messrs. Abbett, Beckel, Bird, Brown, Burton, Burwell,

                        Mr. BUSKIRK voted in the affirmative, explaining that it should not be
                            regarded as any indication as to how he should vote on the bill.
                        So, two-thirds not voting in the affirmative, the motion to suspend the
                            constitutional provision was rejected.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB (having voted with the majority for that purpose) moved to
                            reconsider the vote first taken. He was not aware that the proposition
                            would be offered to-day, but it being here, he thought we ought, to come
                            to a square vote upon it. The constitution prohibited an increase of the
                            salary of the Governor during the term of his office; and his next term
                            would commence next Monday. Three thousand dollars a year was entirely
                            inadequate. It had been found necessary, heretofore, to help the
                            Governor with perquisites. He cited a case in 1855, when he was a member
                            of the House, which inserted a provision in the general appropriation
                            bill, giving perquisites to Governor Wright, in connection with swamp
                            lands, amounting to about $3 000. It was not asked of gentlemen now to
                            vote in favor of the bill. He hoped, therefore, opposition would not be
                            offered at the very threshold. This vote would simply open the bill for
                            consideration on its merits, when it might be modified or amended. If it
                            were made a party question, it was manifest the bill could not pass
                            before the time when it would be useless for the purpose for which it
                            was introduced.
                        Mr. BROWN. I may as well state now as at any other time that I am.
                            opposed to increasing the Governor's salary, and shall use all
                            legitimate means within my power to prevent the passage of a bill
                            increasing it. And to be certain that I have not wasted away any of the
                            legitimate means I possess to prevent its passage, I shall vote against
                            the reconsideration of the vote just taken, which prevents the
                            suspension of the constitutional rule permitting the bill to be read the
                            second time to-day. The constitutional provision declaring that all
                            bills and joint resolutions shall be read on three several days in each
                            house before their passage, in my judgment, is a wise enactment.
                        But it is said the bill can be no benefit to the present executive unless
                            the rule is dispensed with and the bill passes the House to-day. I do
                            not desire or intend to benefit the present executive by increasing his
                            salary. I do not know that his excellency desires his salary increased.
                            In his message, which he delivered to us on yesterday, he said nothing
                            about it. And some weeks ago his party friends drew strongly upon him
                            for an extra session of the General Assembly, in order that his own
                            salary and that of other officers might be increased, and he declined to
                            call it together. In doing so, in my judgment, he did right. This is no
                            time to increase the pay of public officers.
                        Mr. DUNHAM now moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table, but
                            withdrew for
                        Mr. GRIFFITH, He thought it necessary that the salary of the Governor of
                            the State should be raised, and also the per diem of Senators and
                            Representatives, as well as the salaries of State and local officers.
                            Gentleman had spoken of hardships. He submitted that the agricultural
                            and mercantile portions of the country were faring better and prospering
                            more than ever before. But the people's representatives, the Governor
                            and public officers, really felt those hardships--but not yet, perhaps,
                            to the extent of those who stand in front and face the enemies of our
                            country. He had already (by mistake) sent up a proposition raising the
                            per diem of members, and hoped to get it in to-day. He had hoped also
                            that it might be seen by the action on these bills, that there was a
                            disposition here not to be governed by party questions and
                            considerations. This idea of low salaries was not always the most wise
                            and economical. He would have salaries such as would not merely invite
                            the rich man to official positions, but such as would stand also as a
                            premium to the poor man to enter the public service.
                        Mr. DUNHAM now insisted on his motion to lay on the table.

                        So the motion was rejected, and the question recurring on the motion to
                            reconsider.
                        Mr. COFFROTH suggested an adjournment till 2 o'clock, to remove
                            difficulties in the minds of gentlemen now seemingly opposed to the
                            bill
                        Mr. DUNHAM. I do not intend to make a speech, Mr. Speaker, but I desire
                            that those opposed to the bill may understand the effect of the
                            parliamentary management of the gentleman from Marion. If he can succeed
                            now in suspending the rules, on Monday gentlemen on the other side will
                            have the bill completely in their power.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. I disclaim entirely the imputation of a legislative
                            trick.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. I beg the gentleman not to say "trick," it is merely
                            "legislative strategy." (Laughter.) 

                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. If we can't pass this bill on Monday, we might as well not
                            pass it till next year. And it is certain we cannot pass it on Monday
                            unless it is permitted to go to a third reading to-day-and that cannot
                            be done without suspending the rules-and it is manifest that the rules
                            cannot be suspended without the consent of Democratic members. I will
                            say again, sir, that I do hope that gentlemen will not let their
                            prejudices govern them so far as to exclude the bill from a second
                            reading today.
                        Mr. Newcomb's motion was then agreed to without a division, and the
                            question recurred on the motion to suspend the constitutional
                            provision.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK intimated that as his Republican friends would not allow us
                            time to consult, he should vote against suspending the constitutional
                            provision.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB acquiesced, and on his motion the House adjourned till 2 P.
                            M.
                    


                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        The House met at two o'clock.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK stated to the House that he was advised that the Speaker had
                            gone home. He moved, therefore, that the gentleman from M&rion (Mr.
                            Newcomb) take the chair.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        The SPEAKER, pro tem, before proceeding to business,
                            said the chair would give notice of a matter which would be of some
                            importance nest Monday. The Clerk desires to intimate to members the
                            duty of those having returns of the election of Governor and Lieutenant
                            Governor, to hand them in.
                        The question pending is the motion to suspend the rules, so as to admit
                            of the passage of the bill No. 1, introduced by the gentleman from
                            Warren (Mr. Gregory) to the third reading. The constitutional provision
                            requires the yeas and nays. The Clerk will proceed to call the roll.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. Mr. Speaker, since the proposition has perhaps
                            already been defeated, (I learn that gentlemen on the other side have
                            determined against suspending the rules,) I will ask leave to withdraw
                            it from the House.
                        The SPEAKER pro. tem. That can be done only by
                            unanimous consent.
                        Several voices. "No consent." 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It is competent for the motion to suspend to be
                            withdrawn.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Mr. SPEAKER, there has been something said
                            about the Governor refusing to call an extra session.
                        The SPEAKER pro. tem. The gentleman will recollect that
                            the question is not debatable.
                        Mr. DUNHAM stated the order.
                        The motion to reconsider was withdrawn.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Mr. Speaker I attended on the call here to
                            advise about an extra session of the Legislature some time ago.
                        Mr. BROWN (interposing.) There is nothing before the House.
                        Mr. MILLER. I make the motion, then, to suspend the rules.
                         Mr BROWN. Then I again raise the objection that that motion is not
                            debatable.
                         The SPEAKER, pro tem. The gentleman can make a brief

                                        and,

                                        less expense that it should ; and,

                                        Court of Common Pleas and Circuit Court has been very much

                                    WHEREAS, A much better system of doing
                                        Probate business can be established ; therefore,

                                        meet in the Hall of the House instanter, to witness the
                                        counting of votes for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and

                        Without any action thereon, and by common consent. Senators left their

                         INAUGURATION. 
                        The PRESIDENT pro tem, conducted the Hon. Conrad Baker,
                            Lieutenant Governor elect to the Chair, and having commanded order,
                            said: Gentlemen of the Senate--I shall not detain you
                            with a valedictory address. I simply desire to return to Senators
                            present my grateful thanks for the kindness and the confidence which
                            they manifested at the session of 1863, in elevating me to the position
                            of presiding officer of this Senate. In attempting to discharge the
                            duties of that position, I have had an eye single to fairness and
                            impartiality in the administration of its duties. If I have failed in
                            any one point, it has not been the error of the heart, but the error of
                            the head. I trust, gentlemen, that we are assembled this session of the
                            Senate under more auspicious circumstances than in 1863. The dark cloud
                            which overhung our political horizon is, I trust, dispelling, and I hope
                            the legislation of the Senate will be directed to the accomplishment of
                            such a state of affairs as will bring about an honorable peace to the
                            people of the United States. I trust, without distinction of party,the
                            Senators in this Chamber will lend their utmost endeavors for the
                            purpose of sustaining the integrity of the Union. I trust we will be
                            disposed to stand by the Constitution and maintain the integrity of the
                            Government. I present to you now the Hon. CONRAD BAKER, the future
                            presiding officer of this body.

                        THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then rose and said : Gentlemen of
                                the Senate:-The first intimation I had that the inauguration
                            ceremonies were not completed, was contained in the invitation for you
                            to attend here for the purpose of witnessing the further inauguration
                            ceremonies as pertaining to myself. I am not given to public speaking,
                            and if I were, the oath I have taken is the best pledge I can possibly
                            give for the faithful discharge of my duty. While I remember that the
                            duties of the chair require me to treat all Senators as gentlemen and my
                            equals I do not forget that the equal division of the Senate imposes
                            upon me unusual responsibilities. I bring to the discharge of my duties
                            no long experience, but a sincere desire to perform them faithfully, and
                            I trust you will give to me your kind indulgence and forbearance, and I
                            have no doubt we will get along smoothly and entertain friendly
                            relations toward each other. I believe when the Senate adjourned, bills
                            and resolutions were in order. They are still in order. 

                    


                    
                         A VOTE OF THANKS.

                        On motion, by Mr. BENNETT, the reading of the journal of Saturday's
                            proceedings was dispensed with.

                        Mr. BENNETT moved that the Senate proceded to the election of Assistant
                            Doorkeeper.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        A call of the Senate revealed the fact that Mr. Bradley was the only
                            Senator absent without leave. 




                        
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, nominated James S. Morgan, of Daviess county, for
                            Assistant Doorkeeper.
                        Mr. BENNETT nominated S. G. Thompson, of Wabash county.
                        There being no other nominations, the Senate proceeded to the fifth
                            ballot for Assistant Doorkeeper, with the following result:

                        
                        
                            
                                


                                    Those who voted for Mr. Thompson were:

                                        Milligan, Niles, Noyes, Oyler, Peden, Richmond, Terry,
                                        Thompson, Van Buskirk, Ward, Woods, and Wright21.

                                    These who voted for Mr. Morgan were:
                                    Messrs. Barker, Bowman, Brown of Wells, Carson, Cobb, Corbin,
                                        Douglas, English, Finch, Fuller, Gaff, Gifford, Hanna, Hord,
                                        Jenkins, Marshall, Mason, Moore, McClurg, Newlin, Staggs,
                                        Vawter, and Williams-23.

                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. BONHAM, when his name was called, announced that he had paired off
                            with Mr. Downey--absent by leave of the Senate.
                        Mr. S. G. Thompson having received a majority of all the votes cast--
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared him duly elected Assistant Door-keeper,
                            and administered to him the oath of office.
                    



                    
                         SERGEANT-AT-ARMS. 
                        Mr. CASON moved that the Senate proceed to the election of
                            Sergeant-at-Arms.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS stated that it had been a good many years-six or eight at
                            least-since a Sergeant-at-Arms had been elected by the Senate; and he
                            was opposed to an election now, for he could not see any good that would
                            result from it.
                        Mr. BEESON said: During his long experience in legislative bodies he had
                            seen no necessity for a Sergeant-at-Arms. We have had no such officer,
                            as has been stated, for many years, and he was satisfied the Door-keeper
                            could discharge the duties of the officer proposed to be elected. And if
                            an emergency should arise requiring a Sergeant-at-Arms, we have the
                            power to call into existence that affair at any moment. It seemed to him
                            it would be unnecessary to elect that officer, and for that reason he
                            should oppose the election.
                        
                        The motion to elect was rejected by yeas 12, nays 36.
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                    





                

                

                
                     HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         MONDAY, January 9, 1865.
                    
                    The House met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The journal of Saturday having been read and approved-
                    Mr. NEWCOMB. Mr. Speaker, in order to prepare for the reception of the Senate
                        for opening and publishing the vote for Governor, I offer the following:

                    
                        
                            


                                Resolved, That the Senate be invited to seats
                                    in this Hall instanter for the purpose of opening and counting
                                    the votes for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and that seats
                                    be provided for them on the right of the Speaker's chair.
                            
                        
                    




                    The order was adopted.
                    Mr. STRINGER asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Gregory of Warren
                        till to-morrow at 2 o'clock.


                    
                         RETURNS OF VOTES FOR GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. 
                        Senators and the officers of that body now-appearing at the center door
                            of the Hall, and (being received by the Speaker, officers and members of
                            the House of Representatives standing in their places) they were duly
                            seated in the places prepared for them--the President of the Senate
                            presiding at the right of the Speaker.
                        The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen of the Convention, we are assembled in the House
                            of Representatives for the purpose of complying with that provision of
                            the Constitution of the State of Indiana which requires that the votes
                            cast for Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be opened and published
                            this day in the presence of both houses of the General Assembly. I am
                            informed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the returns
                            of some fourteen counties have not been received by him, and that he has
                            sent to the office of the Secretary of State for the certificates of
                            returns of those counties made to that office. I now submit to the
                            Convention whether the certificates which have been seat to the
                            Secretary of State's office shall be used here.
                        It was so ordered by the Convention.
                        And then the opening' and publishing of the returns of the votes for
                            Governor and Lieutenant Governor, cast at the last October election,
                            proceeded in order, (the Speaker of the House of Representatives
                            announcing the counties and opening the returns as they were read by the
                            Clerk,) with the following general result:


                        
                            For Governor.

                            received ....131,666 votes.
                        The SPEAKER observing that the returns from the county of Vermillion came
                            up without seal, submitted to the Convention whether they should bs
                            received and published notwithstanding.
                        It was so ordered by unanimous consent.
                        The PRESIDENT said : The Chair was informed that no returns were here
                            from the counties of Washington and Lawrence. An abstract cf the returns
                            from those counties had been given by the Secretary of State. He
                            submitted whether the Secretary's abstract shall be taken here.
                        It was so ordered by unanimous consent.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Mr. President, I move that a committee consisting of two
                            members on the part of the Senate and three on the part of the House of
                            Representatives, be appointed by the Chair to inform Governor Morton and
                            Lieutenant Governor Baker of the result of the election, and invite
                            their attendance here.
                        It was so ordered by unanimous consent; and accordingly
                        The PRESIDENT appointed Messrs. Beeson and Williams on the part of the
                            Senate, and Messrs. Buskirk, Newcomb and Kilgore on the part of the
                            House to constitute said committee.
                        The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen of the convention, the following is the result
                            of the election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor: Oliver P. Morton
                            has received 152,084 votes, and Joseph E. McDonald has received 131,201
                                votes for Governor; Conrad Baker
                            has received 147,795 votes, and Mahlon D. Manson has received 131,656

                            Governor, I declare him to be duly elected Governor of the State of
                            Indiana for the constitutional term of four years, from this date
                            inclusive.
                        Conrad Baker, having received a majority of all the votes cast for
                            Lieutenant Governor, I declare him to be duly elected Lieutenant
                            Governor of the State of Indiana for the constitutional term of four
                            years.
                    

                    
                         THE INAUGURATION. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, from the Joint Special Committee
                            appointed to invite the Governor and Lieutenant Governor elect to appear
                            before the Convention for inauguration into their respective offices,
                            reported that they had performed that duty.
                        Whereupon Mr. BUSKIRK, accompanied by those officers elect, advanced to
                            the area before the Speaker's table, and introduced them to the
                            President of the Convention.
                        The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen of the Convention, I present to you Governor
                            Morton and Lieutenant Governor Baker. The oath of office will now be
                            administered to them by Mr. Justice Gregory, one of the Judges of the
                            Supreme Court.
                        The oath having been administered accordingly--
                        Governor MORTON ascended the dais of the chair, and read his Inaugural
                            Address, as follows:
                        
                            Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:
                        
                        In entering upon the duties of another term it is not improper to express
                            the gratitude I feel for the generous confidence manifested toward me by
                            the people at the late State election. They have dealt kindly with such
                            official errors as I may have committed, and have given me full credit
                            for an earnest desire to faithfully perform my duties toward the State
                            and Nation. The circumstances by which we are surrounded have converted
                            the Executive position from one of comparative ease and leisure to one
                            of great labor and responsibility, and the return of peace will not
                            bring back to it the rest and freedom from care enjoyed by its
                            incumbents in other times.
                        The history of the last four years is fraught with immense interest to us
                            and to the world. A civil war burst upon the country deluging it with
                            blood, costing many thousands of precious lives, squandering almost
                            incalculable treasure, and bringing in its train such sufferings and
                            horrors as the human mind can scarce comprehend. The crime of this
                            dreadful conflict does not rest with us, nor with the Government of the
                            United States; but attaches itself wholly to the mad ambition and
                            criminal hopes of Southern politicians and leaders, who were animated by
                            the evil spirit of slavery, and the insane pride and self-confidence of
                            an insolent aristocracy.
                        Our State, an integral part of one mighty people, has stood fast by her
                            allegiance, and has, sealed with her best blood her devotion to the
                            national unity. But while we are called to shed bitter tears over the
                            graves of many of our fellow citizens, who have died, that their country
                            might live, we have still many causes for thankfulness and rejoicing.
                            Good health has generally prevailed within our limits, labor has met a
                            liberal reward, bounteous harvests have repaid the farmer's toil,
                            manufacturers have increased and prospered, and commerce has brought to
                            us its richest returns. Being thus blessed with an abundance of all the
                            necessaries and even luxuries of life, we are enabled to discharge in
                            part the sacred obligations we owe the defenders of our country, by
                            providing for their families and dependent ones, placing them beyond the
                            reach of want, and surrounding them with the comforts of life, thus
                            testify, ing the gratitude of an earnest and intelligent people. And
                            while we have mourning at many hearth-stones, and the dark cloud of war
                            rests upon the southern horizon, Indiana has signs of prosperity and
                            power she never knew before. The patriotism and courage of her people
                            have placed her in the very front rank, and commands the admiration of
                            the world; their fidelity to obligations of whatever kind is recognized
                            at home and abroad; their military, political and commercial importance
                            is more conspicuous than ever before, and, by consequence, the current
                            of emigration and wealth is setting towards us with a rapidly increasing
                            volume. There is ample evidence for the statement that Indiana is
                            increasing in population more rapidly than at any previous period in her
                            history. From every part of the State comes the intelligence that our
                            towns are rapidly filling up, new lands being brought into cultivation,
                            and new enterprises of manufactures and commerce set on foot. It is
                            indeed a strange anomaly, and one which no human foresight could have
                            perceived, that in the midst of a desolating civil war, our State should
                            have unusual prospects spread out before her, of prosperity and power.
                            Let us endeavor by wise and fostering legislation, to realize them all,
                            and consolidate them into a healthy and permanent growth.
                         Trusting that your deliberations will be conducted with harmony, and
                            your conclusions dictated by wisdom, I beg leave to assure you that I
                            shall gladly co-operate with you in all measures of legislation
                            calculated to promote the interests of the State, or to aid the General
                            Government in suppressing the rebellion and preserving the unity of the
                            nation; and that I shall bring to the performance of my duties an
                            earnest purpose to execute the laws, protect the rights of all, and
                            maintain inviolate the honor of the State.
                        The PRESIDENT. Gentlemen cf the Convention, the object for which we are
                            assembled has been accomplished. I now pronounce this convention
                            adjourned sine die. Senators will repair to the Senate Chamber to attend
                            on the farther ceremonies of the inauguration of Lieutenant Governor
                            Baker.
                        The Senate having retired,
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the House (at 3:45 P. M.) adjourned till

                            which was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                         COUNTY AND TOWN BONDS. 

                        Mr. COBB, from the special committee thereon, returned Mr. Bennett's bill
                                [S. 3] legalizing county,
                            town and township bonds heretofore issued for the relief of soldiers'
                            families, recommending its passage.
                        

                        The report was concurred in, the bill considered as engrossed, and
                            finally passed by yeas 43, nays 3.

                        Mr. CORBIN, when his name was called, stated that he voted against the
                            bill because he did not endorse the principle of legalizing acts done
                            contrary to law.
                    
                    
                         FOR THE RELIEF OF SOLDIERS. 
                        Mr. COBB, from the Special Committee thereon, returned
                            Mr. Vawter's bill (S. 13,) empowering County Boards to borrow money for
                            the purpose of the encouragement of enlistments in the army, and for the
                            relief of soldiers' families, recommending passage.
                        
                        The report was concurred in, the bill considered as enrolled, and finally

                         TUESDAY, January 10, 1865.

                        the Hospital for the Insane.
                    On motion of Mr. BROWN, it was referred to the Committee on
                            Scientific and Benevolent Institutions.
                    Mr. BROWN presented the credentials of John K. O'Brien, Representative from
                        the county of Martin, and he being invited by the Speaker, came forward, was

                         STATIONERY, STAMPS, NEWSPAPERS, STATUTES. 
                        Mr. MILLER, from the Special Committee on Stationery,
                            &c., submitted a report recommending that there be appointed by the
                            House a competent clerk who shall take charge of the  Stationery Room, and purchase from time to
                            time such articles of stationery and postage stamps, and in such
                            quantities as the Speaker pay by his order, direct. And it shall be the
                            duty of the said clerk, on the written order of my member or elective
                            officer of the House, to procure and place on the desk of each member or
                            officer such newspapers as they nay order; to open an account between
                            the Stationery Room and the members and elective officers, and charge
                            each member and elective officer with the newspapers and stationery they
                            may get-no member or officer being allowed to draw from room a sum to
                            exceed $80 in value; and at least one day before the adjournment of the
                            session, to make out and file with the Speaker the amount drawn by each
                            member and officer, and if the sum drawn by the member or officer shall
                            be less than $80, then said member or officer shall be entitled to draw
                            on money a sum sufficient to make it $80, except the Speaker, who shall
                            be entitled to draw $150. The report further directs that the Librarian
                            procure fifteen copies of Gavin & Hard's revised statutes for the
                            use of the House, and ten for the use of the committees, and one copy of
                            flashing's Manual for the Speaker, which are to be returned to the
                            Librarian at the close of the session. That the Speaker shall draw the
                            stationery for the House, and the chairman of committees for
                            committees.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to strike out the $80. He was not in favor of increasing
                            his salary in that manner. All of us had made a bad bargain in coming
                            here, bat he intended to stick to it. He was in favor of drawing
                            stationery as heretofore. This was only an attempt to evade the law, by
                            which it is prescribed that we shall receive but $3 per day. He should
                            oppose every proposition to increase it this session.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted that neither branch of the Legislature had been in
                            the habit of complying with the law strictly, with refer once to the
                            matter of compensation here, and he cited the fact that our clerks had
                            for years been receiving $4 a day, when the statute prescribes that they
                            shall receive the same compensation as members.
                        Mr. BROWN. Was there a statute fixing the clerk's salary at $3?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. On page 56 of the Revised Statutes, the act says a member
                            shall receive $3 per day, and that the compensation of the clerks shall
                            be the same as that of members of the General Assembly. This had been
                            evaded all the time. These were times of progress; and certainly it was
                            no time now to retrograde in compensation. He respectfully submitted to
                            gentlemen that they ought not to be so tenecious of meager compensation
                            for the public service.
                        Mr. MEREDITH, This recommendation had been put on the score of economy.
                            That was the ground on which it was submitted. Years ago it was the
                            practice of the Congress of the United States to make appropriations for
                            the promiscuous drawings of these articles by members. But they had
                            abandoned it: and he understood something like the mode recommended in
                            this report was in vogue there now. We put this on the ground that the
                            appropriation of $80 to each member as a matter of better economy than
                            to allow stationery to be drawn as heretofore, and he trusted that the
                            report would be supported in that light.
                        Mr. HUMPHREYS was decidedly in favor of the report. It placed members on
                            the ground of equality. Under the former practice, the gentleman from
                            Jackson could draw more than $80, and still go home and say he opposed
                            the raising of compensation.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Acting on that committee, he took the advice
                            of older members, advising that this would be cheaper. They advised us
                            that some members were in the habit of taking home more than the $80
                            worth of stationery. It was expected that members would take the papers,
                            as heretofore. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM assured gentlemen that since 1855, most members had received
                            more than $80 worth. In 1857 it was above that average. The object was
                            equality, and therefore he moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                        The SPEAKER suggested a difficulty about applying the amendment. It was a
                            proposition to cover newspapers, stamps and all.
                        Mr. BROWN proposed to strike out all except the Manual and Statutes.
                        Mr. PUETT. We have a resolution for taking a certain number of
                            newspapers. I would like to know whether that has been made the basis of
                            a contract.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. That resolution was referred to the
                            reporting.
                        Mr. KILGORE. What number of Statutes are recommended?
                         Mr. MILLER. Twenty-five.
                         Mr. BRANHAM withdrew his motion.
                         The amendment was rejected. The question recurred on concurrenee in the
                            report.
                        Mr. PUETT moved to strike out "Clerk," and insert "Librarian." The State
                            Librarian could do this work with slight additional compensation.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Last session the Librarian was instructed to do this, and
                            the additional compensation was equal to the amount that would pay a
                            clerk.
                        Mr. COLLINS inquired why we should have twenty-five statutes more? We
                            have them on all our tables.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Those have not been ordered by the House.
                         Mr. PUETT withdrew his amendment
                         Mr. KILGORE understood that the statutes had been supplied by the
                            Librarian in good faith, as he understood the order. His object was to
                            say, that the adoption of the report would be a reflection on the
                            Librarian. It would be throwing seventy-five copies of the statutes on
                            the hands of the Librarian, who is, perhaps, involved in a contract for
                            the first volume of the statutes. This ought to be investigated. He was
                            in favor of a copy of the statutes for each member. He thought we were
                            entitled to them. Two years ago members received them and took them
                            home.
                        Mr. GREGORY was decidedly in favor of each member having a copy of the
                            statutes.
                        Mr. WRIGHT was desirous that his constituents should know precisely what
                            this item of stationery amounts to, and therefore  offered the following amendment: Strike
                            out "eighty," wherever it occurs and insert "one hundred."
                         Mr. RICE proposed to amend the report, by striking out what pertains to
                            the statutes, and inserting: "one copy of the statutes for each member,"
                            which he shall not be required to return.
                        This amendment was agreed to.
                        The question recurring on Mr. Wright's amendment
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the amendment on the table.

                        Mr. Wright's amendment was then agreed to.
                        The SPEAKER. Will the House concur in the report as amended?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was not willing In other times the State had been in the
                            habit of paying for newspapers. He had made a requisition on his
                            constituents for subsistence. It hadn't yet been honored. Was this
                            designated as a perquisite to help our salary? If he ever stole he would
                            make it respectable.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. The fact that the gentleman was speaking to the proposition
                            made it respectable.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK spoke seriously against the recommendation. In his view it
                            would be better to continue the former custom. He would not represent a
                            constituency that would have him to purchase newspapers for their
                            accommodation. It was not presumable that any gentleman would furnish
                            himself inordinately.
                        Mr. BROWN renewed his motion to strikeout all that relates to newspapers,
                            stamps and stationery. He still contended that this was a proposition to
                            help cut the per diem. He demanded the yeas and nays.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The report proposed the very thing desired by the gentleman
                            from Monroethat the people shall pay for the newspapers of the House. It
                            was the same with the stationery. Here every member was to be placed on
                            an equality. Heretofore it had not been so.
                        Mr. BURTON moved to lay the amendment of Mr. Brown on the table.

                        So the amendment was laid on the table.
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved a clerical amendment strike out fifteen copies; which
                            was taken by consent.
                        Mr. BURTON proposed to amend by striking cut "newspaper?." and inserting
                            "each member shall be supplied with three copies of the Journal and
                            Sentinel, and $100 to each member in stamps and stationery."
                         The SPEAKER ruled the amendment to be out of order.
                        Messrs. BROWN and BUSKIRK opposed the ruling of the Chair, and Mr.
                            GRIFFITH supported it.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend by striking our. "newspapers." The
                            gentleman from Parke [Mr. Rice] had applied an amendment to strike out
                            '"statutes." The gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Wright] had applied
                            another making the money $100, and was not his amendment equally
                            applicable and in order?
                        Mr. BRANHAM explained the proposition with reference to newspapers. The
                            main point of difference from former practice, was to give to each
                            member the right to select what paper he will have. He gets them wrapped
                            and stamped.
                        Mr. KILGORE was in favor of Mr. Buskirk's amendment, for the reason that
                            he wanted at the end of the session just as much of that $100 as he
                            could possibly save. It was an indirect means of enabling us to pay our
                            board.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. If gentlemen were going to strike out these items of
                            newspapers, &c., we would have no need of the $100.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, was in favor of Mr. Buskirk's amendment, for the
                            reason that our constituents ought certainly to receive the papers, and
                            have general information of what is going on here.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE was opposed to any method of raising members' salary. He
                            regarded the distribution of newspapers distinctly for the benefit of
                            our constituencies. If the $100 proposition were adopted, the effect,
                            under the pocket pressure here, would be, that but few papers would be
                            distributed. It was also an indirect evasion of a constitutional
                            provision. He rather favored the Buskirk proposition, but his vote on it
                            should not commit him to support the $100 proposition.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved to lay Mr. Buskirk's motion on the
                            table.
                        Mr. MILROY made an ineffectual motion that the House adjourn.

                                        NAYS-Messrs. Beckel, Bird, Brown, Burton, Burwell,

                            So the resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. COFFROTH obtained consent to offer an order, which was adopted,
                                that the Door-keeper furnish low seats for the pages when not
                                actively employed.
                            Mr. WOODS introduced a joint resolution (No. 4) to amend the 23d
                                section of Article IV of the Constitution so as to provide for laws
                                such as that the people of incorporated cities, towns, townships,
                                and school districts, may tax themselves for the promotion of
                                schools without reference to a uniform rate of taxation.
                            Which was read and parsed to a second reading.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, submitted a resolution to the effect, that it
                                is the duty of this General Assembly to make a fair and equitable
                                apportionment of the State for representative purposes in Congress
                                and the State Legislature.
                            Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to refer it to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved to refer it to the Judiciary
                                    Committee, with instructions to inquire and report
                                whether, under the Constitution the present Legislature can
                                apportion the State for Senatorial and Representative purposes.
                            The motion was agreed to. 

                        


                        
                             GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. 


                            Mr. BROWN moved the House to order, the printing of 8,000 copies of
                                the Governor's Message and Inaugural-5,000 in English and 3,000 in
                                German.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved to postpone the consideration of the
                                motion, and make it the special order for Monday.
                            Mr. BROWN. What object?
                            Mr. KILGORE. We have not the right kind of a printer.
                            Mr. BROWN insisted that the Governor's message ought to be printed
                                and in our hands at ones. He questioned the wisdom of making the
                                public interest wait on the completion of partizan
                                organizations.
                            Mr. KILGORE. In ordinary times he would have no objection. Mr.
                                Bingham was the State Printer, and every man here knew that his
                                paper, for the past three years, had been opposed to the best
                                interests of the country, and he was opposed to patronizing such a
                                man.
                            Mr. BROWN called the gentleman to order. Mr. Bingham's patriotism was
                                not in the question.
                            Mr. KILGORE went on to show that the public interest could not suffer
                                from a little delay.
                            Pending this question
                            On motion by Mr. BOYD (at 3.50 P.M.) the House adjourned till
                                to-morrow morning 9 o'clock. 
                        
                    
                
                

                
                     IN SENATE.

                    
                        WEDNESDAY, January 11, 1865
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.

                    
                         OFFICIAL HARDSHIPS. 

                        Mr. HORD presented a petition from the officers of Bartholomew county,
                            and Mr. ENGLISH from the officers of Clark county, praying for the
                            enactment of a law granting them additional compensation.

                        These petitions, together with others of a similar character heretofore
                            presented, were referred to the Committee on Finance,
                            and it was ordered that those coming in hereafter shall be so referred
                            without reading.
                    

                    
                         $100 FOR EACH SENATOR IN LIEU OF STATIONERY. 

                        Mr. HORD, from the Special Committee thereon,
                            submitted the following:

                        Mr. President-The Select
                                    Committee appointed under a resolution of the Senate
                                to devise and report a suitable mode of providing stationery for the
                                members and officers thereof, have instructed me to report that,
                                believing in the exercise of a rigid economy, and the use of a
                                frugal and sparing hand in our dealings with the public money, we
                                have used some effort to find the amount of expenditures heretofore
                                     required for purposes of
                                stationery, that a convenient and just system might be devised for
                                an equal and conscionable distribution of the same. The committee
                                have inquired of the Secretary of State, who distributed a portion
                                of the stationery to the members o the preceding session of the
                                Legislature, as to the cost of the stationery thus provided, and he
                                reports that he has no data upon which to estimate the cost of the
                                same, inasmuch as such stationery as was dispensed by him was
                                purchased prior to his entry into office, but he is satisfied that
                                the stationery furnished would exceed, upon an average, one hundred
                                dollars to each member, at the low rates at which stationery was
                                then purchased; and since that time stationery has increased almost
                                three-fold in value,and would economise the finances of the State to
                                pay each member $100, and require the members to furnish their own
                                stationery. Such a measure would avoid the necessity of a stationery
                                clerk and a stationery doorkeeper, at a cost of $12 per day, thereby
                                saving to the State the sum of $732 in these items alone ; and it
                                will secure an equal and just distribution of stationery among the
                                members. The committee therefore recommended to the Senate that each
                                member of the Senate shall be paid the sum of one hundred dollars
                                and the president of the Senate $150, for stationery purposes to be
                                paid by the treasurer of State to the members, on the certificate of
                                the president, and to the president upon his own order ; and that
                                the State librarian shall furnish to the principal and assistant
                                secretaries of the Senate all stationery required by them, upon
                                their own order, and to the chairman of the committees upon their
                                order, on a vote of their respective committees. The committee
                                believing that this arrangement would shut off the sluices of a
                                wasteful extravagance, recommend it to the consideration of the
                                Senate.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, opposed increasing the pay of members in this
                            manner. There is & bill before the Senate, providing that the pay of
                            legislators shall be in gold or silver or its equivalent; and this he
                            took to be the proper way, if an increase of per diem is desired. In
                            good old Democratic times three dollars a day was drawn in paper
                            equivalent to gold; and, in addition, members were allowed to draw such
                            stationery as they might find necessary for their use, be that either
                            much or little. If $100 be voted to each member it cannot but operate
                            unequally, for a working member might expend one-half of that sum in
                            stationery, while a member having but little to do might go home with
                            ail the money in his pocket. He took, it the State Constitution
                            contemplated that members shall receive three dollars per day, not in
                            such paper as is called by the name of "green-backs," but Constitutional
                            currency known as gold and silver, or its equivalent; and therefore the
                            bill referred to ought not to meet with taft disapproval of any person
                            upon this floor.
                        Mr. OYLER thought it might some time be proper to inquire who is engaged
                            in this system of public plunder. If he mistook not, this idea of paying
                            members in gold will meet with sore defeat. This is a covert way to
                            increase our pay, and he was opposed to doing that indirectly which we
                            cannot do directly.
                        Mr. RICHMOND repelled the charge made by implication, that the committee
                            regarded their own pockets more particularly than the weal of the
                            State.
                        Mr. BENNETT favored the adoption of the report of the committee, not for
                            the purpose of increasing his pay, but because he believed the facts set
                            forth in the report, and was sure the plan therein proposed would prove
                            a saving to the State.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that it had been his. intention, and he had so
                            expressed himself, to vote against the principle of the report, but on
                            reading in the morning papers the statement of a gentleman [Mr. Branham,
                            of the House,] who is probably better acquainted than any other with the
                            disbursements and financial affairs of the State, that the expenditures
                            for stationery have generally been more than one hundred dollars for
                            each member, he had concluded that it was proper to favor the
                            report.


                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK demanded the previous question.
                        
                        The demand was seconded by a majority of the Senators elect, and the
                            report of the committee was concurred in by yeas 30, nays 19--as
                            follows:

                        Mr. HORD, from the special committee thereof, returned his bill [S. 17]
                            authorizing the buying of county bonds with unloaned school money,
                            recommending its passage.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        
                        Mr. HORD made an ineffectual motion--yeas 9, nays 40--to suspend the
                            rules that the bill may be put on its passage.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the bill and report were referred to the
                                Committee on Education.

                            Whereupon, and by unanimous consent, Senators left their seats and

                        WEDNESDAY, January 11, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.  The
                        journal of yesterday having been read and authenticated.
                    The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the President of the

                        several branches thereof.
                    On motion of Mr. BROWN, it was ordered to be referred to the
                            Committee on Banks.
                    Mr. SPENCER asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Sullivan, of
                        Vanderburg, till Friday.
                    Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, presented a petion from ------- , with reference to
                        taking acknowledgements of deeds, &c., by soldiers in the army; which,
                        without reading, was referred to the Committee on the
                            Judiciary.

                    
                         COMMON SCHOOL FUNDS. 
                        Mr. RICE submitted the following:

                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, In certain counties of the State
                                        of Indiana, during the past year, large sums of the common
                                        school funds having been lying idle and unloaned by the
                                        County Auditors of said counties, for the reason that no
                                        persons have applied for the loan of the same,
                                        therefore--
                                    Resolved, That the Superintendent of Public
                                        Instruction be requested, at as early a day as possible, to
                                        report to the House the amount of said fund so misapplied,
                                        and from which no revenue is accruing.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted. 

                    

                    
                         LAW OF FREIGHTS. 
                        Mr. COLLINS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Corporations be, and they are hereby
                                        instructed to inquire into the propriety and expediency of
                                        regulating, by law, freights and fares on all public
                                        conveyances in this State; and report at their earliest
                                        convenience, by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        On the motion of Mr. BOYD, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Corporations.
                    

                    
                         DISTRIBUTION OF JOURNALS AND ACTS. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted the following:

                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, By this House, the Senate
                                        concurring, That the Clerk of each Circuit Court of this
                                        State be directed to distribute the Senate and House
                                        Journals and Acts of the General Assembly, on hand in his
                                        office, giving to each Township Trustee and each County
                                        Commissioner, one copy of each of said Journals and Acts;
                                        and he shall distribute the balance as his discretion may
                                        suggest, to citizens in his county: provided that he reserve
                                        two copies of each for the use of his office. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. That will require an act of the General Assembly.
                        On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH the resolution was referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to
                            report by bill.
                        Mr. RICE introduced a bill [No. 9,] to repeal any restriction or limit as
                            to the per centum per annum to be divided to the stockholders of any
                            railroad company that shall have organized and constructed a railroad
                            prior to the adoption of the Constitution of this State, or to the
                            enactment of the General Assembly providing for the incorporation of
                            railroad companies, so that all railroad companies shall be on an equal
                            footing and have the same terms as to dividends upon their earnings.
                        Which was read and passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. GROYES introduced a bill [No. 10,] to amend the act to provide for
                            the compensation of Township Assessors.
                        Mr. STEWARD introduced a bill [No. 11 ]to divide the State into
                            Congressional Districts, and to fix the times when elections for
                            Congressmen shall be held therein.

                        Mr. HARRISON introduced a bill [No. 12] to amend the first section of an
                            act for the better protection of religious meetings, agricultural fairs,
                            and other lawful assemblages of the people. Approved March 3,1859.

                        Which bills were read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                         SOLDIERS' HOME. 
                        Mr. GREGG introduced a joint resolution [No. 5] asking Congress to
                            authorize the State of Indiana to apply certain lands granted to the
                            State for the endowment and support of a College, to the founding,
                            endowment and support of a Soldiers' Home, for the soldiers and seamen
                            of the State who have been disabled, or the families of those who have
                            died or may die during the present war.
                        Which was passed to the second reading. 
                    
                    
                         THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. 
                        The SPEAKER announced the order of unfinished business, (which has
                            precedence,) viz: The consideration of Mr. Brown's resolution to print
                            8,000 copies of the Governor's message and inaugural, &c., pending
                            when the House adjourned yesterday.
                        Mr. BROWN said the Senate had already ordered the printing of the message
                            both in English and German; and it would be economy to make this order
                            now, for the law pays for setting the types but once in such a case. It
                            was also due to our own self respect, and it was due also to the
                            Executive and the public service. Partizan feeling should not be allowed
                            to defeat the dictates of public duty.
                        Mr. KILGORE said his reason for delay was not that it would not be
                            printed by a Republican, but that it was sought to be ordered to be
                            printed by a disloyal man.
                        Mr. BROWN. Did not the gentleman vote for the order for four copies of
                            Bingham's paper yesterday?
                        Mr. KILGORE. We had to do it in order to get a loyal paper. His
                            constituents would not justify him in throwing State patronage into the
                            hands of a man that has been proved to have belonged to a secret
                            disloyal order.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. The evidence before the Commission disclosed no such fact.
                            Mr. Bingham belonged only to the military part of the organization.
                        Mr. KILGORE. Yes, sir, cowardice perhaps prevented his going the whole
                            hog.
                        Mr. BROWN inquired whether the evidence did not reveal the fact, that
                            Governor Morton and other high officials were, for a long time before
                            they acted, advised of the character of that order, and of many of its
                            members?
                        Mr. KILGORE. We wanted every scoundrel in Indiana to get into it.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK had understood that certain persons were employed to go round
                            over the State to get men into the order.
                        Mr. KILGORE. They might have been hired by the Copperheads; they were not
                            by Governor Morton. The gentleman from Monroe warned his party against
                            this, but so did not Bingham.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired merely to say that he had not yet engaged in partisan
                            controversy  here. He supposed we
                            would have to have a free fight here sometime, and asked whether that
                            fight should commence now? If not, then he submitted that this debate is
                            not pertinent to the matter before the House. He himself preferred
                            legitimate legislation. He was willing to meet opponents in the
                            discussion of these questions; but unwilling that they should be
                            obtruded upon us every day and every hour. He trusted that the House, in
                            good faith, would at once take action on the resolution.
                        Mr. KILGORE did not want to take up time in this order of discussion; but
                            they must not ask us to send orders to a disloyal man.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                the Judiciary.
                        Mr. BROWN. Was not the object delay?
                        Mr. NEWGOMB promised immediate attention to the matter.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, asked Mr. Brown whether his feeling of urgency
                            in this matter was on account of his respect for the Governor or the
                            public service?
                        Mr. BROWN. Both, sir.
                        Mr. KILGORE. How long since you acquired that respect for the
                            Governor?
                        Mr. BROWN. Since I had the honor of the acquaintance of his
                            Excellency.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the motion to commit on the table.

                        
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken on Mr. Brown's
                            motion, the result was--yeas 37, nays 57--as follows:

                                        Prather, Eeese, Rhodes, Kice, Riford, Sabin, Shuey, Sim,
                                        Steward, Stiver, Stringer, Sullivan, of Posey and
                                        Vaoderburg, TrusIer, Upson, Welch, Whiteside, Willis,
                                        Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zigler and Mr. Speaker--57. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the motion was rejected; and the question recurred as to Mr. Newcomb's
                            motion to refer.
                        The motion was agreed to, and the resolution was referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.

                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved by the House of Representatives,
                                        (the Senate concurring,) That the two Houses meet in joint
                                        convention in this hill, at 2 1/2 o'clock P. M. this day, to
                                        proceed to the election of State Agent, State Printer, State
                                        Librarian, Trustee of the Wabash and Erie Canal, Director of
                                        the Southern Prison, and Directors of the Northern
                                        Prison.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. COFFROTH said,it was doubtful, whether there was more than one
                            Director to be elected for the Northern Prison. He recited the general
                            statute, page 464, 1 Gavin & Hord, and the act of 1859, and that of
                            1861, special session. He was supported in his view that but one
                            Director was to be elected by the legislation of 1863. He cited pages
                            140, 144, of the Journal of the House of Representatives. of 1863; and
                            moved to refer that part of the resolution which refers to the Northern
                            Prison, to the Committee on the Judiciary, with
                            instructions to inquire whether there be a vacancy or not.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB replied. He thought the set of 1861 did not conflict with
                            the set of 1859. He could not see how the general Prison law could
                            affect the term of directors. We cannot go beyond the act of fixing the
                            term without a special act. He cited the acts.
                        Mr. COFFROTH insisted, that there was no law fixing the term of directors
                            in the Prison north, unless it be by virtue of the law of 1857. An
                            investigation before the committee might throw lighten the subject and
                            prevent litigation.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. It seemed to him that the law of 1859 was explicit in its
                            direction, that these directors shall hold for three years.
                        
                        The motion to refer was rejected-affirmative 37, negative 59 ; and the
                            question recurring on the concurrent resolution, it was adopted.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Railroads be instructed to inquire whether
                                        any, and if so what Railroad company it is, that is charging
                                        a greater rate of passenger freight and tariff (local or
                                        otherwise) than is allowed by their respective charters: and
                                        also to inquire what litigation is necessary, (if any) to
                                        protect the public from such extravagant charges ; and
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN the resolution was referred to the committee on
                            Railroads.
                    
                    
                         SUBSTITUTE BROKERAGE. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted a preamble and resolution reciting the late city
                            ordinance of the town of Indianapolis to prohibit substitute brokerages
                            in said city for recruits for the army outside of Center township; and
                            that said ordinance is believed to be in open violation of the charter
                            of said city, and that its operation is prejudicial to the interests of
                            other portions of the State,and instructing the Committee on
                                the Judiciary to inquire, &c, and report by bill.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was of the opinion that that ordinance was in violation of
                            the city charter. If not, it ought to be held to be so, or worse. The
                            effect of it was to prevent agents from other counties to supply their
                            recruits from soldiers discharged here. He had sometimes done something
                            in the way of gelling men into the service; but if he were to attempt to
                            recruit amongst soldiers from his county, discharged here, instead of
                            occupying his place here, he might have a place in the city jail. He
                            regarded that city ordinance an outrage.
                        Mr. SHUEY also regarded it as an outrage. He cited the fact that
                            recruiting agents were advertising to supply substitutes in his
                            counties. If anything was to be done, he would vote for a law
                            prescribing that any recruiting agent here, recruiting for any other
                            place than Center township shall be locked up and fined $50.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said the object of the ordinance was to suppress these
                            substitute brokerages. If it were a resolution of mere inquiry, he
                            should not oppose it, and he should not oppose it very strenuously any
                            way. He cited the evils of tolerating these substitute brokerages,
                            encouraging and educating bounty jumpers-not filling up the army. He
                            would vote for a law that should utterly wipe out this business. He
                            confessed that he was in favor of 
                            the city ordinance recited in the resolution, so far as it had gone.
                            With regard to veterans from other, counties being enlisted and credited
                            here, he submitted how many veterans discharged here would not go home
                            before re-enlistment? He advised the enactment of a law prescribing the
                            maximum of bounty that shall be offered in the various counties. 


                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The speech of the gentleman from Marion reminded him of the
                            old lady's opinion of Billy Haven's sermon against back-biting--he "took
                            it all to himself." The city of Indianapolis will have all the
                            recruits.


                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Soldiers would usually go to the cities and
                            county-seats to enlist. He did not want any law passed that would
                            prevent men from going into the country to enlist.
                        The preamble and resolution was adopted.


                        Mr. PRATHER introduced a bill [No. 13] for the relief of persons who have
                            lost property by rebel raids, and to provide payment for the same.

                        Which was read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                         THE LAWS IN NEWSPAPERS. 
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Public Printing be instructed to inquire into
                                        the expediency of reporting a bill authorizing the
                                        publication of all laws hereafter enacted in one or more
                                        newspapers in each county, and fixing compensation for the
                                        same.
                                    The resolution was adopted.
                                
                            
                        
                    



                    
                         RELIEF OF SOLDIERS' FAMILIES. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill [No.
                                14] for the relief of families of soldiers and mariners of
                            this State in the service of the United States, and of those who have
                            died or been disabled in such service, and prescribing the duties of
                            certain officers therefor named.
                        Which was read and passed to the second reading.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the constitutional restriction was suspended;
                            yeas 86, nays 9. The bill was read the second time by title, passed the
                            second reading and referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                        A message from the Senate announced here that that body had concurred In
                            the House resolution of this morning for & joint convention of the
                            two Houses for the election of certain public officers at 2 1/2 o'clock
                            this afternoon.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. Since the adoption of the resolution yesterday to mail papers
                            to our soldiers in the army, he had learned that the Christian
                            Commission were supplying the soldiers with papers. He therefore moved
                            that the vote adopting that resolution be now reconsidered.
                        Mr. BROWN understood that the Doorkeeper had already made the contract
                            for the. papers, in pursuance of which they had been laid on our tables
                            this morning. The contract should be carried out.
                        Pending the motion to reconsider, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock
                            P. M.
                    


                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                         The SPEAKER resumed at two o'clock, P. M.
                         A message from the Senate announced, the passage by that body of Senate
                            enrolled bills Nos. 3 and 13, and
                            requesting the concurrence of the House therein.

                        
                             NEWSPAPERS FOR INDIANA SOLDIERS. 
                            The SPEAKER. The pending question is on the motion of the gentleman
                                from Jackson (Mr. Brown) to lay the resolution of the gentleman from
                                Jefferson on the table.
                            Mr. BROWN withdrew the motion to lay on the table.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved that the Speaker be directed to deduct a sum
                                sufficient to pay for those newspapers to be drawn equally from the
                                $100 apiece voted to ourselves yesterday, but withdrew it for
                            Mr. HENRICKS, who submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Stationery Clerk be
                                            instructed to charge each member with the cost of all
                                            the statutes furnished him, and also the cost of all
                                            newspapers placed on his desk for any purpose
                                            whatever.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BROWN moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on
                                    the Judiciary. Almost everything from this side goes
                                to that Committee.

                            
                            The motion was rejected--affirmative 30, negative 37, and the
                                question recurred on adoption.
                            Mr. BRANHAM demanded a division of the question.
                            Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I think I can see, in advance, what will be
                                the result of this newspaper question, and other kindred questions.
                                I know that, so far as the State is concerned, its finances will not
                                be improved. I therefore move to lay the resolution on the
                                table.
                            The yeas and nays were demanded.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK explained, that each member had been furnished with a

                                choice, 70. Mr. Foster, having received a majority of all the votes
                                cast, is duly elected State Librarian, for the term prescribed by
                                law.
                            In the order of nominations for Canal Trustee-
                            Mr. CHAPMAN nominated David M. Dunn, of Cass.
                            Mr. NEWLAND nominated Wm. N. Sangster, of Fountain.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS raised the question that the statute requires this vote
                                to be taken by ballot.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB read from the State constitution the clause prescribing
                                that "all elections by the people shall be by ballot, and all
                                elections by the General Assembly shall be vive voce."
                            The PRESIDENT. That settles the question.
                            Mr. BENNETT. This question was pretty throughly considered by the
                                joint convention of the General Assembly of 1859, and the reason
                                then given for a ballot for this officer was this: the law of 1846
                                prescribes that these officers shall be elected by ballot. This law
                                was regarded in the nature of a contract--a contract made before the
                                adoption of the new Constitution. It was supposed that the State
                                creditors would be glad to get out of the contract, and it was
                                thought best to be as cautious as possible in this proceeding.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK read from the statute of 1846.
                            Mr. NILES was clearly of opinion that it would be proper for us to
                                proceed by a viva voce vote. The Constitution
                                requiring all elections of this body to be by viva
                                    voce, the canal law, specifying a ballot vote, could be
                                held only to indicate that the officer shall be elected. The form of
                                the election could not materially affect the interest of the
                                State.
                            Mr. DUNNING moved to proceed with the election by a viva
                                    voce vote.
                            It was so ordered by consent.
                            Whereupon the vote proceeded and the PRESIDENT reported-

                            Mr. Senator BROWN, of Wells, submitted the following, and demanded
                                that the vote thereon be taken by yeas and nays.
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That it is the sense of this
                                            joint convention of the General Assembly that two of the
                                            Directors of the Northern Prison are entitled to hold
                                            their office for four years from the time of their
                                            election and qualification thereto.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DUNNING said the Convention had no right to determine any
                                question by yeas and nays. He proposed to proceed viva
                                    voce, and let the Judiciary Committee or the Supreme Court
                                take care of the question.
                            The PRESIDENT declared the resolution out of order.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, appealed from the decision, of the Chair.
                            Mr. DUNNING. That cannot be done, sir; because, Mr. President, you do
                                not preside over this body as a legislative body. It is a joint
                                convention for elections. It is not legislative business.
                            The PRESIDENT. We are not here for the purpose of interpreting laws,
                                but for the purpose of carrying out the order of the two Houses of
                                the General Assembly.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, did not pretend to compare his opinion with that
                                of the Chair, but inasmuch as we were here for a specific purpose,
                                and a part of that purpose for the election of the Directors for the
                                Northern Prison, it seemed to him perfectly competent for the
                                convention to say by resolution that those Directors now in office
                                shall remain for two years longer. Taking that view himself, he had
                                submitted the resolution.
                            The PRESIDENT. Is it the pleasure of the convention that these
                                Directors be voted for together or separately ?
                            Mr. BRANHAM proposed separately.
                            It was so ordered by consent.
                            Mr. BONHAM nominated Carlton E. Shipley, of Delaware.

                        Mr. BOWMAN presented a petition from half a dozen township assessors in
                            Washington county, praying for the enactment of a law granting them
                            additional compensation; which was referred to the Committee on
                                County and Township Business.
                    
                    
                         BANK OF THE STATE. 
                        Mr. BONHAM, from the Committee on Banks, returned the
                            bill [S. 29,] authorizing the
                            Bank of the State, or its branches, to reduce their capital stock,
                            recommending passage. The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. CULLEN moved that the bill be considered as engrossed, and read the
                            third time now.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to lay the bill on the table and print two hundred
                            copies.
                        Mr. DUNNING and Mr. BENNETT explained that the bill was simply an
                            enabling act, pointing out the manner in which the Bank or any of its
                            branches can reduce its circulation and close up its affairs, in order
                            to give way to the national currency.
                        Mr. COBB favored the motion to print.
                        Mr. NILES assured Senators that there was nothing wrong in the bill now
                            being considered.
                        Mr. CORBIN objected to urging through important matters. No good or
                            sufficient reason had been given for hurrying this bill over and above
                            others introduced before it, and now waiting action on the files of the
                            Senate. It would be much better to let the bill take its regular
                            course.
                        Mr. CULLEN. The committee carefully considered it this morning, and would
                            be far from insisting on the passage of the bill, was there anything in
                            it but what was right and proper.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS insisted that this was an important matter and should not be
                            passed hastily, and that his motion to print ought to prevail.
                        Mr. BENNETT demanded a division of the question.
                        
                        The Senate refused to lay the bill on the table-yeas 11, nays 33; and
                            refused to print by yeas 12, nays 33.

                        
                        The motion [Mr. Cullen's] was agreed to, and the bill was read the third
                            time and passed by yeas 36, nays 10, as follows:

                                        remote.

                         COMMITTEE ROOMS. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB asked and obtained leave to offer the fallowing:

                        Resolved, That a special committee of the House be
                            appointed to confer with a similar committee on the part of the Senate
                            for the procurement of committee rooms within the Capitol; and if not
                            within the Capitol, as nearly adjacent thereto as practicable.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was advised that Governor Norton had taken rooms at the Bates
                            House, and vacated what is known as the Governor's House.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. It is so.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK then proposed to amend by ordering possession of the
                            Governor's House for committees. But on explanation by Mr. Newcomb, he
                            withdrew it.
                        The resolution was then adopted.
                    

                    
                         STANDING COMMITTEES-ORDER OF BUSINESS. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH (obtaining unanimous consent therefor) moved that 300 copies
                            of the standing committees just announced be printed for the use of the
                            House.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired the Chair to state the daily Order of Business.
                        Mr. SPEAKER. The order of business is indicated in the 53d, 54th and 55th
                            Rules. It is:

                        
                            First. Reception of Petitions.
                            Second-Reports from Standing Committees.
                            Third-Reports from Select Committees.
                            Fourth-Introduction of Joint Resolutions and Bills.
                        
                        And when bills are called for, that is the proper time for motions and
                            resolutions.

                        Mr. BRANHAM. Is not the order of business printed in the rules?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, No sir.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Then I suggest that they be printed with the committees.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired the order of business on & convenient slip of
                            paper. He moved to amend Mr. Griffith's motion, by a request; that the
                            Chair cause the order of business to be printed with the standing
                            committees.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB didn't see the use of printing again what we had already in
                            the rules on our tables.
                        Mr. Buskirk's modification was concurred in, and so the motion was agreed
                            to.
                    


                    
                         PETITIONS. 
                        Mr. MEREDITH presented the memorial of John P. Baird of Vigo county, on
                            the subject of printing Attorney's briefs with the Supreme Court
                            reports, which was referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, presented the memorial of the Common Council
                            of the city of Lafayette, with a letter from the Hon. John Pettit, and
                            accompanying papers and draft of a bill to amend the city Charter so as
                            to enlarge the borders thereof, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        Mr. BROWN obtained leave of absence for Mr. Miller of Clinton-unwell.
                        Mr. RICE presented a petition from the County, Commissioner's of Park
                            county, desiring that the school fund may be loaned in sums to the
                            extent of $1,000, which was referred to the Committee on
                                Education and Common Schools.
                    


                    
                         NEWSPAPERS FOR SOLDIERS. 
                        The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the unfinished business of
                            yesterday, viz: Mr. Higgins' motion to lay Mr. Henrick's resolution of
                            vesterday one the table.
                        Mr. HENRICKS desired the gentleman from Laporte to withdraw his motion.
                            He agreed to withdraw it.
                        Mr. HIGGINS withdrew it accordingly.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. This interminable newspaper question had been a troublesome
                            question from the first. A committee was appointed to get rid of it, to
                            which all motions and resolutions on the subject had besn referred. That
                            committee had reported a recommendation to appropriate $80 to each
                            member, to embrace all his contingent expenses in the line of stationery
                            articles, newspapers, &c. But instead of that the House would have
                            it $100. He considered $80 a large sum for these, purposes; but had been
                            advised that it would not more than cover expenses, as usually incurred
                            here. And after the report had come to this shape, the statutes were
                            stricken out--they having before been furnished to each member by hook
                            or crook. But not satisfied with that, there comes up and the House
                            adopts a resolution to supply our soldiers in the field with 800
                            newspapers daily-a very philanthropic measure-to let them know what we
                            are doing. But let the soldiers read those papers for the last ten days,
                            and it would show him that we had passed but one bill-a local court
                            bill. It would be seen, however, that we were, taking care of ourselves-
                            being furnished with the statutes and newspapers, and the people to pay
                            for them. For one, he was unwilling to allow his record to go to the
                            people in this shape, and therefore he had offered the pending
                            resolution. This was said to be a small matter-involving but a small
                            amount of money. But the question was: Is it ours? There was not a
                            gentleman here but knew the terms on which he comes to this Legislature. 
                        He now renewed Mr. Higgins's motion; but on the appeal of Mr. Buskirk, it
                            was withdrawn for half an hour.
                        Mr. KILGORE, How many papers does the gentleman from Jefferson, send
                            out?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Six copies of the JOURNAL. I am free to say that I do not
                            take the Sentinel.
                        Mr. BROWN. Have you ever seen anything disloyal in the Sentinel?
                        Mr. COLLINS. I have been solicited by quite a number of soldiers to send
                            them Democratic papers, and they have stated that such papers could not
                            pass the lines to them, without disguising them as letters. And I have
                            sent them in that shape.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The Sentinel's course proposes not only to
                            overturn the General Government, but to trample under foot the
                            Government of this State.
                        Mr. BROWN. That was not the question. He announced that when the big
                            fight that was to come, should come here, he was ready. He and his
                            friends would not shirk from any responsibility.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. One gentleman had said be would not send the Sentinel. Another, that he  wanted to send only the Journal. He would ask the
                            gentleman from Jefferson, if he does not know that Democrats are in the
                            field, fighting the battles of their country there? and whether he
                            desires to stipulate here what news such men shall read? Does the
                            gentleman propose to send out partizan newspapers, of only one class, to
                            soldiers of different politics?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. No, he did not. He proposed to send to soldiers in the army
                            such papers as they want. Papers mailed to the army it was better to
                            send by the Sanitary Commission. He took the character of the Sentinel
                            from the character of its editors. He did not read it. He would not
                            overlook the German papers in the distribution to our patriotic German
                            soldiers. And he was disposed to pay for them out of the $100 adopted in
                            the report.
                        Mr. BOYD said more .money was spent in these discussions than the value
                            of the matter in controversy. He had voted for the $100, and he defended
                            it. He did not doubt what gentlemen affirmed of their stationery bills;
                            but then it followed that large amounts were squandered by the officers.
                            He had voted for the $100, and would send the papers proposed.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH deprecated partisan discussion. He was satisfied with the
                            report. Since the resolution of Mr. Kilgore was adopted, he did not
                            complain. But objected to the compulsory proposition of Mr. Henricks,
                            diverting this $100 from the purpose for which it was intended. It was a
                            matter of justice, as well as courtesy, that we should order the
                            Sentinel as well as the Journal. This was a paltry consideration, and
                            the man that had no better capital to commend him to his constituents,
                            did not deserve to have constituents.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Gregory of Warren in the Chair) suggested that more than
                            one hour has been consumed in this debate.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the resolution on the table, but withdrew for-
                        Mr. CHAMBERS. It was not increase of pay to send papers to the soldiers.
                            It was a mistake to say that the Journal or Sentinel was sent to the
                            soldiers by the Christian Commission. They were not sent when he was in
                            the field. He should vote to send these eight papers a day to the
                            soldiers. The moral cowardice that would hesitate about such a matter
                            was not that which our constituents would approve.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. The question was whether we shall pay for
                            these papers to the soldiers.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Both the newspapers and statutes were to be taken out of the
                            $100 by the resolution.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Then we are to pay for the newspapers out of
                            the $100. That was exactly in accordance with the original report. The
                            paying for the statutes was a modification of the report.
                        Mr. HENRICKS (by consent) withdrew that part of the resolution relating
                            to the statutes.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, demanded the previous question.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                        
                        And the yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                            resulted--yeas 67, nays 28--as follows:

                         So the resolution was laid on the table.
                         Mr. BROWN now moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay his
                            motion to reconsider on the table.
                        The latter motion was agreed to. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM took the floor, but yielding-
                        Mr. BROWN submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Doorkeeper of the House
                                        be instructed to contract with the proprietors of the two
                                        German .papers of this city, for two copies of their papers
                                        respectively, wrapped and stamped, for the purpose of being
                                        sent to soldiers.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. BRANHAM refused to give the floor for the resolution, and moved that
                            when the House adjourns to-day, it shall be till to-morrow at 2 o'clock
                            P. M , to give time for the standing committees to organize.
                        Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend the motion so as to say, adjourned till
                            Monday, 2 o'clock P. M.
                        The SPEAKER. That would be inadmissable under the constitutional
                            provision.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that to-morrow would be a much better time to
                            adjourn over, when there might be rooms made ready for the
                            committees.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Rooms could be had.
                        Messrs. Stringer and Chambers now obtained leave of absence till Monday,
                            and Mr. Barwell for two weeks, attending court.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House the report of the Superintendent of the
                            Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb.
                        On the motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was laid on the table.
                        The SPEAKER announced the following special joint committee on the
                            expenditures of the Executive Department: Messrs. Branham, Higgins,
                            Humphreys, Boyd, and Shoaff, of Jay.
                        And the following, under Mr. Newcomb's resolution to procure Committee
                            Rooms: Messrs, Newcomb, Buskirk, and Sim.
                        Mr. Branham's motion, that when the House adjourns to-day, it shall be
                            till 2 o'clock P. M. to-morrow, was now agreed to.
                        Mr. HIGGlNS submitted an order authorizing the Doorkeeper to appoint two
                            Firemen and a Mail Messenger for the House; which was adopted.
                    


                    
                         ANDREW WALLACE. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted the following:

                        
                            
                                
                                     WHEREAS, The law for the government of
                                        the Asylum of the Deaf and Dumb provides that no trustee
                                        "shall be allowed to furnish materials for building
                                        purposes, nor shall they be either directly or indi-  [indir]ectly interested
                                        in the purchase of any article of merchandize or supplies
                                        for the use of such institution.
                                    And whereas, Andrew Wallace has for several years been the
                                        President of the Boards of all the Benevolent and scientific
                                        institutions, including the Asylum for the Deaf and
                                        Dumb,
                                     And whereas, The annual report of the commissioners,
                                        Superintendent and steward of the Indiana Hospital for the
                                        Insane, for the year 1854, shows that one Andrew Wallace has
                                        furnished such institutions about $15,000 worth of
                                        groceries; therefore
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Scientific and Benevolent Institutions be
                                        instructed to inquire and report whether said Andrew
                                        Wallace, who furnished Said groceries is the same person who
                                        was and is the president of the said Boards, and that such
                                        committee be further instructed to make a thorough and
                                        careful investigation into the management of all the said
                                        institutions, and ascertain and report whether any officer
                                        connected with either or all of such institutions has
                                        furnished any materials or supplies to said institutions,
                                        and if any such officer has so furnished such materials and
                                        supplies, to report the name of such officer and the
                                        institution, of which he is a trustee or an officer, and the
                                        value of such materials and supplies, with such
                                        recommendation as may be deemed right and proper under all
                                        the facts and circumstances, and that such committee shall
                                        have power to send for persons and papers and examine
                                        witnesses under oath.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. NEWCOMB could not see the connection between the first paragraph and
                            the latter portion of the resolution. He would not object to it on
                            account of the phraseology, but it was very unfairly drawn. He proposed
                            to amend it go as to allow Mr. Wallace to be present on the examination
                            of witnesses.
                        Mr.BUSKIRK accepted. He did not wish to try Mr. Wallace unfairly. He
                            explained the resolution, showing the connection of its parts. He
                            desired merely that the law should be strictly enforced.
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. 
                        Mr. PUETT introduced a joint resolution (No. 6) to authorize a Convention
                            to amend the Constitution of the State of Indiana to meet the first
                            Monday in May, &c.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the joint resolution be made the special order for
                            Monday, at 2 o'clock, which he subsequently withdrew.
                        Mr. BRANHAM said it should go the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                        Mr. BROWN proposed to make it a resolution of inquiry.
                        Mr. PUETT accepted the modification. And so the resolution was
                            adopted.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved an order for three copies each of the two Indianapolis
                            German newspapers. But modifications being urged, he withdrew it.

                                            Military Committee.
                                
                            
                        

                    
                    
                         NEW PROPOSITIONS. 
                        The following joint resolution and bills were introduced, read the first
                            time, and severally passed to the second reading.
                        By Mr. BONHAM, a joint resolution [S. 8] instructing our Senators and
                            requesting our Representatives in Congress to use their influence in
                            favor of a law increasing the fees of non-commissioned officers and
                            privates in the army of the United States.
                        By Mr. BEESON, [S. 41,]
                            authorizing the sale of certain real estate, being lots 4, 5 and 6 on

                         By Mr. MOORE, [S. 42,] changing
                            the times of holding Common Pleas Courts in Putnam and Clay
                            counties.
                        By Mr. HORD, [S. 43,] authorizing an injunction against tenants who shall
                            unlawfully hold over.
                        By Mr. NILES, [S. 44] declaring joint contracts and obligations to be
                            joint and several in their nature so far as relates to the remedies to
                            enforce the same.
                        By Mr. BONHAM, [S. 45.] amending section 37 of the misdemeanor act.
                        By Mr. FULLER, [S. 46,] authorizing the Secretary of State to have

                            property may be destroyed in consequence of mobs or riots.
                        By Mr. HORD, [S. 48,] declaratory of the law concerning contempts of
                            court.
                    
                    
                         PAY OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. 
                        Mr. Bonaam's bill, [S. 20,]
                            increasing the pay of members and officers of the General Assembly
                            was read a second time by title only.

                        Mr. VAWTER moved to amend as follows:
                        
                            Strike out "Assistant Secretary" in the Senate;
                                also "Assistant Clerk" in the House. Also so as to provide for the
                                payment of two thousand dollars to the Principal Secretary of the
                                Senate for all clerical services of the Senate for regular session,
                                and fifteen hundred dollars for extra session of the Senate, not to
                                include clerical work for the committees. Also to provide for the
                                payment of the sum of twenty-five Hundred dollars to the Clerk of
                                the House for the same service at regular sessions, and two thousand
                                dollars for the same service at extra-sessions. And the sum of
                                eighteen hundred dollars for Doorkeepers for regular sessions of the
                                House and Senate, and fifteen hundred dollars for extra
                                sessions.
                        

                        Mr. VAWTER said he offered the amendment knowing that it would save the
                            State from $2,000 to $5,000 per session. The manner in which clerks are
                            now appointed makes it an object for the officers to increase the number
                            of appointees, instead of decreasing them. The more the appointees, the
                            more number of members can be pleased, and the stronger, becomes the
                            appointing power. This amendment provides for but one Clerk or
                            Secretary, and one Door-keeper for each House. It provides for the
                            payment to each, officer of about one-third the amount which it now
                            costs the State, and still pays them a fair and liberal salary.
                        On motion by Mr. CASON, the bill and pending amendment, was referred to
                            the Committee on Finance.
                    



                    
                         WORK FOR COMMITTEES. 
                        On motion by Mr. BEESON, the following described Senate bills were read

                        Mr. Hord's [26] concerning real and joint contracts.
                         Mr. Douglas's [27] stallion and jack, and [39] Whitley Common Pleas.
                        Mr. Gaff's [36] city apportionment and assessment.
                        Mr. Corbin's [38] State Asylum officers.
                        Senate joint resolutions 4 and 5,

                         Mr. President: The Committee on Military Affairs, to

                                        To the Senate and House of Representatives, in
                                            Congress assembled:
                                    
                                    The General Assembly of the State of Indiana, respectfully
                                        beg leave to memorialize your Honorable body upon matters
                                        herein set forth, and which your memorialists deem of great
                                        importance to many citizens of the State; and to which your
                                        immediate attention is earnestly requested:
                                    Prior to the 1st of January, 1863, the ranks of the old
                                        regiments, then in the field, had become so greatly
                                        decimated by hard service, and frequent engagements with the
                                        enemy, that it became necessary, in order to preserve such
                                        organization, that a general anxiety was felt, both by the
                                        people and the authorities, that they should be speedily
                                        filled up with recruits.
                                    This anxiety greatly stimulated enlistments, and the prospect
                                        of serving in companies, with experienced comrades,
                                        encouraged volunteering.
                                    The men thus recruited in the State of Indiana, had the full
                                        understanding that they were enlisted for the unexpired term
                                        of the old organization into which they were mustered, and
                                        that they would be mustered out of the service at the
                                        expiration on the original term of service of such old
                                        organizations.
                                    In this understanding, the volunteer, the recruiting officer,
                                        the State authorities, and the people, fully participated,
                                        and in the absence of any order from the War Department
                                        affecting the subject, and for reasons following, this view
                                        of the matter was not unreasonable:
                                    
                                        
                                             1st. At the time these enlistments were made the
                                                impression prevailed generally, in the army and
                                                among the people, that the war would end, and the
                                                soldiers be discharged even before the expiration of
                                                the original term of service of the organisations
                                                into which such recruits were mustered.
                                        
                                        
                                            2d. The recruiting was carried on for particular
                                                regiments, and not for the service generally, there
                                                being no general system of recruiting for the army
                                                established, thus naturally producing a belief that
                                                no service outside of or beyond the term of these
                                                regiments would be exacted.
                                        
                                        
                                            3d. The advantages of maintaining old organizations,
                                                and placing recruits among old experienced
                                                associates, under the command of tried officers was
                                                apparent to all, and it was equally apparent that no
                                                recruits could be induced to enlist in any
                                                organization that would terminate prior to the
                                                expiration of, the term for which said recruits were
                                                to be mustered, thereby separating such recruits
                                                from their former comrades and officers, and without
                                                their consent attaching them to organizations in
                                                which they would ba total strangers.
                                        
                                        
                                            4th. Whole regiments had been enlisted and accepted
                                                into the service for terms no greater, thus inducing
                                                the belief that soldiers were desired without
                                                particular reference to the term of service.
                                        
                                        
                                            5th. The impending draft of that year was for a term
                                                of nine months, which induced the belief that
                                                volunteering for a much longer period, as was the
                                                case with such recruits, would be a judicious
                                                arrangement for the Government.
                                        
                                        
                                            6th. At the time these enlistments were made no
                                                system of recruiting had been devised, or talked of,
                                                and of course there could be no intimation that any
                                                regiment would be continued beyond the time of its
                                                original enlistment.
                                        

                                    
                                    With these views, recruiting officers invariably informed
                                        such recruits that they were to be discharged at the
                                        expiration of the term of service of the old organizations
                                        into which they consented to be mustered, and this was
                                        agreed to and concurred in by the mustering officers then on
                                        duty. Recruiting and mustering officers were strengthened in
                                        this view of the case from the general tenor of certain
                                        orders of the War Department, providing for and regulating
                                        recruiting for old regiments, which orders, when critically
                                        considered, were not as explicit as might have been desired,
                                        but nevertheless were apparently on the hypothesis that the
                                        recruiting was for the old regiments, and not for the
                                        general service, and that they would be discharged at the
                                        expiration of the terms of such old regiments. One of these
                                        orders reads as follows, viz:

                                                 General Orders No. 108.]
                                                 I. Whenever volunteer troops are mustered out of
                                                  service, the entire regiment or other
                                                  organization, will be considered as mustered
                                                  out at one time and place, except prisoners of
                                                  war, who will be considered as in service until
                                                  their arrival in a loyal State, with an allowance
                                                  of time necessary for them to return to their
                                                  respective places of enrollment.
                                                By order of the Secretary of War.

                                                Nor was this understanding, as your memorialists
                                                  are advised, confined to the people of the State
                                                  of Indiana, but that it prevailed extensively in
                                                  other States. And this general prevalence of such
                                                  views tended to strengthen the same with the
                                                  people of Indiana. The following official document
                                                  was extensively published in the public journals,
                                                  and greatly tended to increase the probability of
                                                  the correctness of the views generally entertained
                                                  by the people:

                                                SIR-In reply to yours of the
                                                  21st, stating the number of regiments raised in
                                                  your State, and also making suggestions in
                                                  reference to filling old regiments, I am directed
                                                  to say that recruits for old regiments of
                                                  volunteers for three years, or during the war,
                                                  will be discharged at the expiration of the term
                                                  for which the regiment was originally
                                                  enlisted.
                                                By order of the Secretary of War.
                                                C. P. BUCKINGHAM, Brig. Gen. and A. A.
                                                  General.
                                            
                                        
                                    


                                    
                                        
                                            
                                                The foregoing fact , your memorialists believe to
                                                  be sufficient to establish the fact that recruits
                                                  enlisted in old organization, at the time referred
                                                  to, were fully under the impression that they were
                                                  only to serve for the unexpired term of the
                                                  organization into which they were mustered, and
                                                  that their retention in the service after such
                                                  time works as great hardships upon them, and is
                                                  greatly calculated to discourage and dishearten
                                                  them.
                                                Your memorialists are fully aware that the muster
                                                  rolls which said recruits signed, described an
                                                  enlistment for three years, or during the war, but
                                                  at the same time are informed and believe that
                                                  such averments in said rolls were explained to
                                                  them as being mere technical forms, and would, in
                                                  no wise, interfere with the understanding upon
                                                  which they enlisted, and thus did not disturb the
                                                  conviction in their minds that they would be
                                                  discharged with the regiments they were assigned
                                                  to, but, on the contrary, that the Government
                                                  would, in good faith to her soldiers, execute
                                                  fully the agreement made with them by her
                                                  recruiting officers.
                                                Your memorialist are further informed that this
                                                  matter had, by His Excellency Governor Morton,
                                                  been fully laid before the War Department, and its
                                                  fiction urged in reference to the game; and that
                                                  said Department has decided that it can take no
                                                  action in the matter, as, from the form of the
                                                  muster rolls, these recruits would be held for a
                                                  term of three years, without reference to the
                                                  expiration of ithe term of the organizations to
                                                  which they belong. But at the same time, your
                                                  memorialists are confidently of the opinion that
                                                  it is clearly within the power of Congress to
                                                  grant the proper remedy to these worthy men, and
                                                  your attention is respectfully out earnestly
                                                  called to the matteras alike demanded by justice,
                                                  good faith, and sound policy.
                                                One case, your memorialists desire to call your
                                                  especial attention to, as somewhat differing from
                                                  all others:
                                                The company of Captain Charles W. Patton, in the
                                                  45th Regiment, (or 3d Cavalry,) of Indiana
                                                  Volunteers, were emitted entire under the full
                                                  Understanding above set forth, and in all respects
                                                  are entitled to the benefits of the foregoing
                                                  memorial mentioned, as they were recruits mustered
                                                  into an old organization. But their case presents
                                                  another merit not enjoyed by any others. So
                                                  confident were all parties that these recruits
                                                  were simply to serve for the unexpired term of the
                                                  old organizations, that the muster rolls of this
                                                  company show that fact. By reference to such
                                                  Rolls, on file in the office of the Adjutant
                                                  General, your Memorialists find that the

                                                  the muster-in rolls of said company, reads as
                                                  follows:

                        The communication and report were referred to the Committee on Benevolent

                        FRIDAY, January 13, 1865.
                    
                    House met at 9 o'clock A. M. 
                    Mr. HIGGINS moved unanimous consent to dispense with the reading of the
                        journal.
                    
                    The motion was agreed to by unanimous consent.

                    

                    A message from the Senate announced the passage in that body of a bill [S. 6] to amend the act fixing the
                        times of the Common Pleas, so as to change the time in Bartholomew and
                        Jennings; and of a bill  [S. 29] to
                        authorize the State Bank to reduce capital stock in Branches and to close
                        the business of the Bank.


                    Mr. THATCHER obtained leave of absence till Monday for Mr. Whiteside.
                    Mr. WRIGHT (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill  [H. R. 14] relative to corporations
                        for mechanical, manufacturing, mining and quarrying purposes; which was
                        passed the first reading, and ordered to the second reading to-morrow.
                    Mr. WRIGHT moved to suspend the constitutional provision, that the bill might
                        be read the second time. 
                    
                         CLINTON COUNTY CONTEST. 
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, rose to a privileged question. He desired an
                            order of the House to enable him to take the testimony of B. N, Waddle,
                            to be used in his behalf in the contest for his seat in this House. He
                            had supposed that he might do this under the 13th section of the act
                            concerning contested elections. But he had been advised by the Speaker
                            that he could not take affidavits without an order of the House. Better
                            to set forth the reason for his motion, he caused a letter from Mr.
                            Waddle, of Michigantown, addressed to himself, to be read by the Clerk.
                            [Mr. Waddle is politically opposed to Mr. Miller; and his letter sets
                            forth that, since he gave his testimony in chief for the contestant for
                            the seat of Mr. Miller, he had come to the conclusion that there was no
                            fraud perpetrated at the ballot box in Clinton county, at the October
                            election; and that thereupon he was compelled to say to him that he
                            ought to modify his deposition, as due to a political opponent, &c.]
                            This letter was not evidence, and therefore he asked the House for an
                            order to allow him to take this man's deposition at some early day.
                        Mr. KILGORE. It would be necessary to have a resolution of the House to
                            authorize the Committee on Elections to send for
                            persons and papers. He would submit such a resolution, if the gentlemen
                            from Clinton would give way. 
                        Mr. MILLER acquiesced.
                        Mr. KILGORE then submitted a resolution to the effect, That the
                                Committee on Elections be authorized and
                            empowered to send for and enforce the attendance of any and all persons
                            to testify in the said contest, and to send for and use such papers as
                            they may deem necessary.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. If the witness fail to answer their summons, the Committee
                            should have power to go out and take the testimony by deposition. He
                            proposed an amendment to that effect. 
                        Mr. DUNHAM. A witness could not be compelled to cross his county lines.
                            The party here ought not to be deprived of evidence. It seemed to him
                            important to secure a full investigation of the case.
                        Mr. HIGGINS proposed to amend the amendment, to the effect that the
                            parties to the contest go themselves and take depositions.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK accepted the modification.
                        The amendment was agreed to, and then the resolution as amended was
                            adopted. 
                    



                    
                         OIL MINING. 

                        Mr. WRIGHT, under his pending motion to suspend the constitutional
                            restriction and allow his bill to be read the second time to-day, said:
                            It appears that we have vast mines of great richness under the soil of
                            Indiana. Men who have been engaged in the oil, business in Pennsylvania
                            and New York, inform me that there are as rich veins of oil in Indiana
                            as in any of the United States, and that they are now waiting for such
                            modifications of the general law as will enable them them to organize
                            companies to develop them. They will bring large amounts of capital into
                            the State for the purpose of opening mines and making investigations. I
                            hope the House will consent to dispense with the restriction.
                        The SPEAKER. The bill having been introduced out of the regular order, it
                            will be necessary for the House to give unanimous consent for the
                            gentleman's motion.
                        Voices. "No consent." 
                        Messrs. Stinger, Croan, Stuckey, Major, Miller and Upson severally
                            obtained leave of absence till Monday and Tuesday.
                    


                    
                         THE CLINTON CONTEST. 
                        Mr. KILGORE asked for the reading of Mr. Buskirk's modification of his
                            resolution, just adopted.
                        There being no objection, the resolution was read, adding these words.
                            "And if any witness shall be unable to attend, from sickness, or any
                            other cause, then the contestants may take the deposition of such
                            witness, and it shall have the same force and effect as if taken before
                            said committee.
                        Mr. KILGORE moved a reconsideration of the vote adopting the resolution.
                            It seemed to him that the amendment would admit of improper delay. He
                            did not want this matter protracted throughout the session.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was also anxious to get along with the best facility. The
                            amendment only applies to witnesses unable to attend. It will not
                            prevent the committee from reporting at any time they may be satisfied
                            to do so.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. The amendment was a little variant from his understanding of
                            it. As it is written, it says the witnesses shall be subpoenaed here,
                            but if from sickness or any other cause they shall be unable to attend,
                            &c. He wished to strike out "any other cause."
                        Mr. SHUEY. As the resolution stands there might be unreasonable delay. He
                            would give the contestants the right to take depositions within such
                            time as shall be designated by the Committee on
                                Elections.The vote adopting the resolution was
                            reconsidered.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB submitted an amendment embodying the suggestion of Mr. Shuey,
                            inserting these words: "within such time as may be prescribed by the
                            committee, and upon reasonable notice to the opposite party."
                        The amendment was agreed to. 
                        
                         Mr. HIGGINS now moved to strike from the body of the resolution the
                            words, "or from any any other cause;" it was also agreed to.
                        And so the resolution was adopted.
                    


                    
                         BILLS FROM THE SENATE-QUESTION OF ORDER. 
                        In the order of the consideration of bills from the Senate, the bill [S. 3] coming up, was passed the
                            first reading.
                        
                        Mr. TRUSLER moved to suspend the constitutional restriction,
                            resulting--yeas 55, nays 23.
                         The SPEAKER decided that two-thirds of the members present voting in the
                            affirmative, removed the constitutional restriction.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK made the point, that the constitutional restriction cannot be
                            removed without two-thirds of all the members of the House voting in the
                            affirmative. He appealed from the decision of the chair.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH sustained Mr. Buskirk's point, quoting precedents.
                        The SPEAKER said a quorum to do business constitutes the House.
                        Mr. DUNHAM explained the order against the decision of the Chair.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB went behind the precedent of the last House, and read
                            authorities going to show that a quorum to do business might suspend the
                            constitutional restriction. He wished to give such a reasonable
                            construction as would enable the House to proceed with the business of
                            the session.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said, if the construction of the gentleman from Marion
                            obtained, it wou'd unsettle the legality of a large portion of the
                            legislation of the session. He was sustained by Cushing's Manual. He
                            went farther back than the last session, to the decision of Speaker John
                            W. Davis, to the effect that it requires 67 members of the House, not
                            merely two-thirds of the members present, to make a quorum.
                        Mr. DUNHAM showed that a distinction is held between the House and a
                            quorum to do business. He urged respect for the authority of
                            precedents.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB again sustained the decision of the Chair.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, read the constitutional provision, and insisted that
                            two-thirds had not voted for the suspension.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said the Legislature of 1853 had acted upon a loose
                            construction of this constitutional restriction--just as it was proposed
                            here to do--and the consequence was that but three acts of that entire
                            session were able to stand the tests of the courts. He showed the danger
                            of corruption in the legislation of the State, flowing from the proposed
                            departure from these precedents.
                        Mr. TRUSLER asked leave to withdraw the faction to suspend the
                            constitutional restriction.
                        The SPEAKER said his reflections during the debate had fixed his opinion
                            beyond question that the ruling of the Chair is correct. It was taken,
                            however, with great deference to the authorities cited. The section 25,
                            (which had been read,) ought to settle the point of difference between
                            the gentleman taking the appeal and the Chair. The Chair held that
                            two-thirds of a quorum is competent to suspend the constitutional
                            restriction. The gentleman taking the appeal that, wherever the term
                            "House" occurs in the Constitution, it signifies a body of 100
                            Representatives. With this understanding, the Chair referred to section
                            25 of the Constitution, which says: "A majority of the members elected
                            to each House shall be necessary to pass every bill or joint
                            resolution." If by the term "House," as urged, 100 members is always
                            meant, it makes the Constitution require but a majority to pass a bill
                            whilst it requires two-thirds to get at it for consideration. He
                            submitted that this section 25 must be an error, according to the
                            construction of gentlemen.
                        The second point was the absurdity of the conclusion. Section 25 provides
                            that 51 votes is necessary to pass a bill, yet the argument of the
                            gentleman says it requires 67 members to take up business for action.
                            Fifty-one members can't place a bill where it may be acted on without
                            the aid of 16 more.
                        According to section 10, each House, when assembled, shall choose it own
                            officers Would it be held by gentlemen that it requires 51 members to
                            elect a speaker or clerk, or to transact the business of
                            organization.
                        This construction would make yet another absurdity in the Constitution.
                            Take the case of the election of the United States Senator. If each
                            House of the General Assembly, in its aggregate character, can only act
                            by this majority, then this House must give fifty-one votes to elect a
                            United States Senator. And he submitted that there had been instances in
                            which gentlemen have sat in the Senate of the United States without
                            having received the votes of a majority of either branch of the General
                            Assembly, according to this construction.
                        Then the 15th section says: "Either House, during its session, may punish
                            by fine and imprisonment, any person not a member" &c. Was it
                            necessary that there should be fifty-one voting in the affirmative to do
                            that?
                        The Chair still insisted that "House" in the Constitution means a quorum
                            to do business.
                        The Chair understands that the gentleman from Fayette [Mr. Trusler,]
                            wishes to withdraw the motion to suspend.
                        The motion and the appeal were accordingly withdrawn by unanimous
                            consent.
                    

                    
                         SCHOOL FUND. 
                        Mr. WOODS (by consent) submitted a resolution requiring the
                                Committee on Education to inquire into the
                            propriety of prohibiting by law any county board from investing unloaned
                            common school funds in the bonds of the county owning said funds, and
                            report, &c.; which was adopted.

                        Mr. SPENCER asked and obtained unanimous consent to introduce a bill [No.
                            16] to authorize supervisors of roads to remove fences and buildings,
                            where water courses have encroached upon the public roads, and providing
                            assessment of damages in such cases.
                        Which was read and passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. HOGATE obtained leave of absence for Mr. Roach till Monday.
                        Mr. BONNER desired to offer a resolution.
                        Mr. HIGGINS objected; preferring the regular order of business.
                        
                        The bill [H. R. 1] to increase the salary of the Governor, &c.
                        The bill [H. R. 2] to increase,the compensation of Judges of the Supreme
                            Court, coming up in the regular order, were read, and severally referred
                            to the Committee of Fees and Salaries.

                        Mr. Woodruff and Mr. Trusler obtained leave of absence until Tuesday.
                        Mr. Griffith's bill, [H. R. 4,] to increase the per diem of members of
                            the General Assembly, coming up was read, and-
                        On motion of Mr. BONNER, referred to the Committee on Fees and
                                Salaries.

                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton's bill, [H. R. 5,] to legalize certain deeds,
                            mortgages, and other instruments in the Recorder's office of Clinton
                            county, coming up-
                        On motion by Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, modified by Mr. DUNHAM, was referred
                            to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                    

                    
                         REVISED STATUTES. 
                        Mr. GREGORY obtained unanimous consent to submit a resolution, which was
                            adopted, authorizing the appointment of a special committee of three to
                            inquire into the cost of procuring the copy right of Gavin & Hord's
                            Statutes, and also into the probable cost of revising the Statutes of
                            the Scats, and report, &c.
                    
                    
                         DIRECTORY TO THE STATE AUDITOR. 
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, obtained unanimous consent to submit a
                            resolution, which was adopted, that the Auditor of State be instructed
                            to furnish this House with the amount of orders drawn by him for State
                            printing; and also the amount of orders drawn by him on the order of the
                            Agent of State during the years 1863 and 1864.
                    

                    
                         JUVENILE OFFENDERS. 
                        Mr. PRATHER, obtained consent to submit the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Benevolent & Scientific Institutions, be
                                        instructed to inquire into the expediency of establishing,
                                        by law, institutions for the correction of juvenile
                                        offenders, and report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB obtained leave to present a petition, which, without reading,
                            was referred to the Committee on Claims.
                    


                    
                         OFFICIAL COMPENSATION. 
                        Mr. HARRISON obtained unanimous consent to submit the following which was
                            adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Fees and Salaries be instructed to examine the
                                        law fixing the compensation of all State and county officers
                                        receiving State and county funds, and if in their opinion it
                                        is too low, that they be instructed to report a bill for the
                                        increase thereof.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. WRIGHT, (by unanimous consent,) submitted an order instructing the
                            Door-keeper to sand all mail matter by the Christian Commission that may
                            be addressed by members of this House to soldiers in the field.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, moved to lay it on the table.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB made an ineffectual motion to adjourn. 
                        
                        Mr. Wright's resolution was laid on the table, by yeas 54, nays 20.
                        Mr. Buskirk's bill, [H. R. 6,] to establish an Agricultural College at
                            Bloomington, in Monroe county, &c., coming up--it was read the
                            second time.
                        The question being: Shall the bill be engrossed for the third
                            reading?
                        Mr. BONNER moved to refer it to the Committee on
                                Agriculture.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to amend by saying the Committee on
                                Education.
                        
                        On the question of concurring in Mr. Griffith's motion the House
                            divided--affirmative 37, negative 26.
                        The SPEAKER announced no quorum voting and directed a call of the House,
                            which proceeded, and the Clerk reported 73 members present.
                         On motion by Mr. DUNHAM further proceedings under the call were
                            suspended.

                        
                        Mr. Buskirk's bill was then referred to the Committee on
                                Education--affirmative 40, negative 30.

                    
                    
                         CLERKS FOR COMMITTEES. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the Committee on Ways and
                            Means, the Committee on Public
                            Expenditures, and the Committee on Claims
                            be authorised to employ such clerical force as they may deem
                            necessary.
                        Mr. DUNHAM thought One clerk for each committee would be sufficient. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It would be Impossible for the Committee of Ways
                                and Means to get along with one clerk.
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed, to amend by restricting the order to one clerk for
                            each committee.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH thought it entirely safe to trust this matter to the
                            discretion of the chairmen of those committees.
                        Mr. RHOADS proposed to modify the amendment by saying, "not exceeding two
                            clerks" which was rejected.
                         Mr.Dunham's amendment was also rejected.
                        The order was agreed to.
                        And then--at 5:25 P. M.--on the motion of Mr. HOGATE, the House adjourned
                            till Moday at 2 o'clock p. M. 
                    

                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        MONDAY, January 16. 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The reading of the journal of Friday was commenced, when-
                     On motion by Mr. DUNNING the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    Mr. MASON submitted a report from the State Librarian, which was referred to
                        the Committee on the State Library without reading.

                    
                         PETITIONS AND REMONSTRANCES.
                        Mr. HORD presented a petition from a citizen of Bartholomew County,
                            praying for $200 compensation for endeavoring to catch the perpetrators
                            of a daring robbery; which was referred to the Committee on
                                Finance.
                        The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a paper from a citizen of Marion
                            County, complaining of existing legislation with reference to the
                            confinement of insane persons; which was referred to the
                                Committee on Benevolent Institutions without
                            reading.
                    
                    
                    
                         THE JOHN MORGAN AND OTHER REBEL RAIDS. 
                        Mr. VAWTER, from the special committee thereon, returned his bill [S.
                            15.] appointing Commissioners to adjust claims for damages sustained by
                            rebel raids, with a report recommending passage with sundry
                            amendments.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to farther amend by striking out "eight" and inserting
                            "five" dollars a day for the pay of the Commissioners.-- While our
                            soldiers were enduring the hardships of the tented field he should
                            oppose exhorbitant compensation to gentlemen who are surrounded with the
                            comforts of home.
                        Mr. OYLER coincided with the opinions just expressed, and hoped the
                            Senate would understand the value of a dollar.
                        Mr. NILES, in the committee, favored $8 a day. He was not without serious
                            apprehensions that a good deal ot trouble would grow out of this. As the
                            Governor values his character he must appoint men on this commission for
                            above reproach, so that there can be no suspicion of unfair dealing. In
                            order to secure such men he favored good compensation, so that the
                            Governor would have no difficulty in obtaining reliable men on the
                            commission. 
                        
                        The amendment was agreed to, by yeas 21, nays 14.
                        On motion by Mr. DOWNEY the bill was farther amended by providing for
                            claims by administrators and executors.

                        On motion by Mr. OYLER it was--
                        
                            
                                
                                    Ordered, That the bill lie on the table and
                                        200 copies thereof be printed for the use of the Senate.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         COUNTY SURVEYORS. 
                        Mr. RICHMOND, reported from theCommittee on County and Township
                                Business, the bill, [S. 32.] giving surveyors power to
                            administer paths to viewers of roads, recommending that it be
                            rejected.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the bill was laid on the table.
                    

                    
                         ANNUAL REPORTS. 
                        The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the report of the condition of the
                            Sinking Fund, which was referred to the Committee on
                                Finance; and the 18th annual report from the Institution
                            for the Education of the Blind, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Benevolent Institutions. 
                    
                    
                         THE GERMAN LANGUAGE IN COMMON SCHOOLS. 
                        Mr. FULLER offered the following, which was adopted by consent:

                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Education inquire into the propriety of so
                                        amending the common School law as to allow the German
                                        language to be taught in school districts where the citizens
                                        thereof may desire it. 
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         LEGAL DISABILITIES OF NEGROES. 
                        Mr. DUNNING offered the following resolution, with the (printed) memorial
                            referred to:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That the accompanying Memorial
                                        of "Western Yearly Meeting of Friends of Southern and
                                        Western Indiana, and Eastern Illinois, held in Plainfield,
                                        Indiana, in 1864," be referred to the Committee on

                                        expediency of adopting suitable measures to so amend the
                                        Constitution of the State as to remove the prohibition on
                                        negroes and mulattoes from voting; and also to inquire into
                                        the expediency of repealing all laws which impair their
                                        evidence in courts of justice, and embarrass their efforts
                                        in the cause of education; with leave to report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted by consent.
                    
                    
                         CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT. 
                        The PRESIDENT announced the select committee of one from each
                            Congressional District, to which was referred the bill [S. 37,]
                            re-districting the State for Congressional purposes, viz: Messrs.
                            Williams, English, Hord, Downey, Bennett, Thompson, Davis, Culver,
                            Brown, of Hamilton, Noyes and Terry.
                    

                    
                         REFUNDING MONEY BORROWED BY THE GOVERNOR. 
                        Mr. CHAPMAN introduced a bill [S.
                                49] to authorize the State Treasurer to refund Winslow, Lanier
                            & Co.; monies paid by them by request of the Governor, as interest
                            on State bonds, with interest on amounts so paid, and declaring an
                            emergency; which was read the first time.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN moved to suspend the rules that the bill may be read the
                            second time now.
                        
                        A constitutional provision requiring the yeas and nays, they were taken
                            resulting; yeas 26, nays 9, whereupon-
                        The PRESIDENT decided that the rule prescribed in section 18, article IV
                            of the Constitution was by this vote suspended.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS dissented from the decision of the Chair. He did not like to
                            see the rule requiring two-thirds of all the members elected to suspend
                            the constitutional rule, and which has been adopted here by every
                            presiding officer for the past ten years, broken down at this late
                            day.
                        Mr. DUNNING maintained that the chair was right; and if, while acting as
                            presiding officer, he had ever decided to the contrary, he acknowledged
                            that it was an error--an error committed without due reflection. He
                            undertook to say that party spirit would predominate when the vote comes
                            on the passage of this bill, and if we are right we had just as well
                            stand up to it like men as to be faltering and hesitating. Let us see
                            whether we are willing to endorse what the people said ia the October
                            election. The Democratic party, when pure, was the party he delighted to
                            honor, and he trusted the Democratic members of the Senate would make no
                            record that will be at war with the purity that party once possessed. He
                            had been honored with a seat in these legislative halls, from time to
                            time, for the past thirty-eight years, and never yet had bolted, and now
                            announced the determination that be never would bolt on any
                            question.
                        Mr. VAWTER believed that the decision of the chair was wrong, remembering
                            that one of the ablest Senates ever convened in this State had
                            determined, after debate, that it required two-thirds of the members
                            elected to suspend the constitutional rule referred to. He would say
                            that, for one, he stood ready to vote to pay all the just debts of the
                            State of Indiana.
                        Mr. ALLISON was very clear in the opinion that the Constitution required
                            only two-thirds of the Senate to suspend the rule.
                        Mr. GIFFORD wished to exonerate himself from any charge of a political
                            nature in the expression of his opinion on this question, and Insisted
                            the Constitution contemplated that two- thirds of all the Senators elected were
                            necessary to suspend the constitutional provision.
                        Mr. COBB. The Constitution requires two-thirds of the Senate to suspend
                            the rule, and the Senate is composed of fifty members. It has been the
                            practice to require thirty-four Senators in the affirmative ever since
                            he had been a member. The Senator from Monroe, [Mr. Dunning,] will not
                            find as many Senators upon the Democratic side opposed to legitimate
                            appropriations as he probably supposes.
                        Mr. CASON believed if two-thirds of all the members elected be required
                            to suspend the rules, legislation could be stopped at any time by the
                            minority, and that certainly was not the intention of the framers of the
                            Constitution.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. It seems the entire history of legislation recognizes
                            the fact that two-thirds of all members elected are a House and a
                            Senate. That being acknowledged as a fact there would be no difficulty
                            in deciding this question.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS again insisted that the decision of the Chair was not in
                            accordance with the intent and meaning of the Constitution.
                        Mr. BEESON. The new Constitution sought to remedy the evils of hasty
                            legislation,and if he, as a member of the Constitutional Convention,
                            voted for an organic law that two-thirds of the members elect should
                            constitute a quorum to do business, and that it should take two-thirds
                            to suspend the rules, while a majority could enact laws, he certainly
                            voted for an inconsistency.
                        After further remarks by Messrs. NILES and DUNNING-
                        The decision of the Chair was allowed to stand without an appeal, and
                            accordingly the bill was read the second time and referred to the
                                Committee on Finance.
                    

                    
                         NEW PROPOSITIONS. 
                        
                        The following described bills were introduced, read the first time, and
                            passed to the second reading:
                        By Mr. COBB, [S. 50,] providing for the redemption of real estate or any
                            interest therein sold on execution or order of sale, &c.
                        By Mr. DYKES, [S. 51,] to amend section 63 of the common school law.
                        By Mr. McCLURE, [S. 52,] defining the offense of bastardy.
                        By Mr. CULVER, [S. 53,] allowing
                            County Commissioners to organize turnpike Companies, ,&c., to levy
                            taxes for their construction, and providing that they shall be free.
                    
                    
                         DEATH OF HON. N. G. SHAFFER. 
                        A message from the House of Representatives announced the death of the
                            Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, a member of that body from Fulton county; and
                            the passage by the House of resolutions of respect for his memory.
                        The message was again read, when,
                         On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, as a further mark of respect for the
                            deceased, the Senate adjourned. 


                    

                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        MONDAY, January 16, 1865.
                    
                     The House met at two o'clock P. M.
                     The journal of Friday having been read and approved--
                    The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from Messrs. Brett and
                        Ristine, Treasurer and Auditor of State and ex officio Commissioners of the
                        Sinking Fund, together with accompanying papers:
                    Which was referred to the Committee on the Sinking
                        Fund.
                    The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the State Librarian,
                        with accompanying papers:
                    On motion of Mr. HARRISON, it was referred to the Committee on the
                            State Library.
                    
                         BILLS FROM THE SENATE. 
                        The SPEAKER announced the consideration of bills from the Senate on the
                            second reading.
                        The bill [S. 3] legalizing local
                            taxation to encourage volunteering, having been read the second time,
                            and the question being--, Shall the bill be engrossed for the third
                            reading?
                        Mr. ABBETT proposed to amend by inserting, after the word "issued," in
                            the fourth line, the following: "and the Board of Commissioners or any
                            agent duly authorized or appointed by them and inserting in another
                            place the words, "and in the manner."
                        Mr. TRUSSLER moved to refer the bill and amendments to a select committee
                            of three.
                        Mr. BOYD proposed to amend the bill by inserting after the word
                            "legalized," in the 10th line, these words: "shall have been equitably
                            apportioned and credited pro rata to the several
                            townships in the county where such. appropriations shall have been
                            made."
                        Mr. STEWART had an amendment partly prepared, and intended to have made
                            the motion of the gentleman from Fayette [Mr. Trussler.] He hoped it
                            would go to a special committee.
                        Mr. RICE moved to refer the bill to the Committee of Ways and
                                Means.
                        Mr. BRANHAM suggested the Committee on the
                            Judiciary.Mr. RICE accepted; and the bill and amendments were
                            referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. STEWART, having completed his amendment, moved that it be referred
                            (without reading) to the same committee.
                        It was so referred by consent.
                        The bill [S. 13] to amend the 17th section of the County Board act of
                            January 17, 1852, having been read the second time--
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee on
                                the Judiciary.
                        The bill [S. 6] to amend the
                            Common Pleas act of March 5, 1859, so as to change the times of holding
                            Common Pleas in Jennings and Bartholomew counties, having been read the
                            second time--
                        Mr. PRATHER perceived from the reading that the bill concerns the people
                            of his county, and as he was not advised that any change in the times of
                            holding this court was desired by the people there, he moved that it be
                            referred to a select committee consisting of the Representatives of the
                            counties interested.
                        Mr. BRANHAM suggested the Committee on the Organization of the
                                Courts of Justice.
                        Mr. PRATHER accepted, and it was so ordered.
                        
                        The bill, [S. 29,] to authorize
                            the Bank of the State of Indiana to reduce capital stock, &c.,
                            having been read the second time--
                        On motion of Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, it was referred to the
                                Committee on Banks. 
                    

                    
                         HOUSE BILLS. 
                        Mr. Shoaff, of Allen's bill, [H. R.
                                8,] providing for taxing dogs, &c., coming up in order,
                            and having been read the second time--
                        Mr. BURNES moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                                Agriculture
                        .Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, moved that it be referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                        Mr. WOODS. In 1861 we had just such a bill as this, and he would like to
                            see it pass. But as it involved a legal question, he would move that it
                            be referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                        The latter motion was agreed to.
                        Mr. Rice's bill, [H. R. 9,] for an act placing all railroads of the State
                            on an equal footing, so that they shall have the same terms as to
                            dividends upon their earnings--having been read the second time--
                        On motion by Mr. GROVES, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Railroads.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Superintendent
                            of the Institution for the education of the Blind, with accompanying
                            documents.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Scientific and Benevolent Institutions.
                    


                    
                         DECEASE OF THE HON. NELSON G. SHAFFER. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH said: Mr. Speaker, once more is recalled to our minds the
                            proverb, "that in the midst of life we are in death." The unrelenting
                            archer has sent a fatal shaft amongst us and stricken down one of our
                            number. It becomes my painful duty to announce to you, sir, and this
                            House, the death of Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, late a Representative from
                            from the county of Fulton. I can say of the deceased member, that he was
                            a gentleman of genial manners, of a warm heart and cordial nature, and,
                            notwithstanding the asperities of party politics, my intercourse with
                            him during the last session has left upon my memory sentiments of
                            profound regret and respect. I am deputed by an informal meeting of the
                            members in the city, had this morning, to report to you and to this
                            House our proceedings, which I now send up to the Clerk's desk.
                        The proceedings were read by the Clerk, as follows:
                        It having been announced to members of the House that Hon. NELSON G.
                            SHAFFER, of Fulton county, a member of the House, had departed this life
                            last evening, a called meeting was had of members in the city, to make
                            arrangements for the funeral of the decased.
                        On motion of Mr. BOYD, Mr. HIGGINS, of Laporte, was appointed Chairman
                            and F. P. GRIFFITH, of Lagrange, Secretary.
                        On a motion of Mr. BECKETT, the Chair appointed a committee of five to
                            draft resolutions consisting of Messrs. Beckett, Boyd, Glazebrook,
                            Shoaff, of Jay, and James.
                        Mr. BECKWITH, from said committee, made the following report:
                        
                            
                                


                                    WHEREAS, It has pleased Almighty God to
                                        take from among us the Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, late a member
                                        of the House from the county of Fulton; therefore-

                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the members and officers of
                                        the House of Representatives will form in procession at the
                                        Bates House, at 11.45 A. M. of this day, and from thence
                                        attend the corpse to the Union Depot.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That His Excellency the Governor,
                                        the Judges of the Supreme Court, and other officers of
                                        State, now at the seat of Government, be invited to unite in
                                        the procession, and that joint participation on the part of
                                        the Senate be requested.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Chairman of this meeting
                                        be directed to appoint two members of the House of
                                        Representatives to accompany the remains of our departed
                                        friend to his late residence in Fulton county.

                                        Committee.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Messrs. Glazebrook and Milroy were appointed a committee, in accordance
                            with the report, to accompany the remains of the deceased to his late

                            necessary arrangements for the funeral.

                            proceedings of the meeting to the House, when convened in regular
                            session.
                        On motion, it was ordered that the daily papers of the city be requested
                            to publish the proceedings of the meeting-
                        And then, on motion, the meeting adjourned.
                        W. W. HIGGINS, Chairman.
                        F. P. GRIFFITH, Secretary.
                        On motion by Mr. COLLINS, it was-

                        
                            
                                
                                    Ordered, That these informal proceedings be
                                        spread upon the journal.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. PUETT submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the House has received with
                                        deep sensibility the melancholy information of the death of
                                        the Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, late a member of this House; and
                                        that we recognize in this dispensation a renewed admonition
                                        of the uncertainty of life, and of our responsibility for
                                        the faithful


                                    Resolved, That we tender to the family of
                                        the deceased, our sincere sympathy with their afflictive
                                        bereavement.

                                    Resolved, That the Speaker be requested to
                                        forward a copy of these resolutions to the family of the
                                        deceased.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. PUETT said he had the honor two years ago of being acquainted with
                            the Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, and found him to be a most amiable and
                            ingenious gentleman. None of us who knew him but must feel a very deep
                            sense of grief upon this announcement of his sudden decease, after a
                            very short illness. The deceased was about midway of life--about 35 or
                            40 years of age--and a few days ago apparently in as fine health as any
                            of us, but the hand of death has taken suddenly from among us his
                            faithful representative. He was decided in politics, but without any of
                            its animosities. So far as Mr. Puett knew, he was one of those men that
                            made and kept fast friends with all, whether they agreed with him in
                            politics or not, and in this he has left behind him a lesson for all of
                            us. He hoped that some gentleman knowing him better than he did, and who
                            might therefore, be better able to do justice to his memory would take
                            the floor and make a record that would do him justice. For himself he
                            could do  little more now than to
                            pay that he never in his life met with a stranger more generous,
                            ingenuous and genial in his manners, and more ready to discharge his
                            public duties, than this deceased member of the House of
                            Representatives.
                         The resolutions were adopted.
                         On motion of Mr. HENRICKS it was-
                        
                            
                                

                                    
                                        Ordered, That the proceedings of the
                                        informal meeting of members this morning, reported by Mr.
                                        Griffith, be made a part of the proceedings of this House.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        On the motion of Mr. STEWART it was-
                        
                            
                                

                                    Ordered, That the entire proceedings of
                                        this House on this solemn occasion, be communicated by the
                                        Speaker to the family of the deceased.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, As a further token of respect for
                                        the deceased, that this House do now adjourn.
                                
                            
                        

                        Members of the Committee on Benevolent and Scientific
                                Institutions, and Mr. Humphreys, now obtained temporary
                            leave of absence.
                        Mr. Shoaff's resolution was adopted.
                        And then, accordingly, the House adjourned. 
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        TUESDAY, January 17, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                     On motion of Mr. VAWTER, the special order for this hour-being the
                        consideration by the Senate as in Committee of the Whole of the
                            Governor's Message-was postponed till Thursday next at 2 1/2
                        o'clock P. M.

                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES. 
                        Mr. DOWNEY, from the Judiciary Committee, reported
                            back Mr., Oyler's bill [S. 23]
                            amending section 76 of the misdemeanor act, recommending its passage
                            with amendments.
                        Mr. BENNETT, from the same, returned Mr. Thompson's, bill [S. 8]
                            authorising cities to fund their moneys, with amendments, recommending
                            its passage.
                        Mr. CASON, from the same, reported Mr. Milligan's County Treasurer bond
                                bill [S. 14] recommending
                            passage with an emergency clause.
                        Which reports were severally concurred in.
                    


                    
                         $100 TO EACH MEMBER IN LIEU OF STATIONERY. 
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK offered the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That each member of the Senate be
                                        allowed one hundred dollars, and the President of the Senate
                                        one hundred and fifty dollars, for stationery; and that the
                                        Treasurer of State be directed to pay the same to each
                                        member, upon the certificate of the President, and to the
                                        President upon his own order.
                                
                            
                        
                        He said the State Treasurer had refused to pay out moneys without the
                            authority which a resolution of the Senate would give; although the
                            report of the Select Committee on Stationery
                            heretofore concurred in, embodied substantially what was contained in
                            this resolution.
                        Objection being heard-
                        Mr. NILES made an ineffectual motion to lay the resolution on the table,
                            that members might have time to canvass the question and more fully
                            understand the necessity for the adoption of the resolution.
                        Messrs. ENGLISH and OYLER demanded the yeas and nays on the passage of
                            the resolution.
                         Mr. ENGLISH would oppose the voting, directly or indirectly, of money
                            into the pockets of Senators; and, indeed, would oppose the increase of
                            pay to any class of public servants unless we commence with the lowest
                            and go up to the highest.
                        Mr. DUNNING hoped the resolution would pass. The Legislature should have
                            been called together in extra session last month, for the express
                            purpose of passing a law increasing the compensation of members of the
                            General Assembly; but as that had not been done the people of Indiana
                            certainly would not grumble at the passage of this resolution.
                        Mr. RICHMOND assured Senators that the Special Committee on this subject
                            carefully considered it, and had come to the most reasonable conclusion
                            authorized by the complete investigation they had made of it.
                        Mr. MASON thought it useless to discuss the the merits of the question
                            now.
                        Mr. OYLER was of opinion that members are entitled to all the stationery
                            they can use, but not more than $3 per day and as he had said before, he
                            was unwilling to do that indirectly which he had not the nerve to do
                            directly; consequently he opposed the passage of the resolution.
                        Mr. HANNA suggested that these gentlemen could compromise this thing. If
                            any Senator desires to convince his constituency that he is more honest
                            than anybody else in the world, that Senator can give his $100 to the
                            Institution for the Education of the Blind, or for some other benevolent
                            object. [Laughter.]
                        Mr. OYLER withdrew his demand for the yeas and nays.
                        And then the resolution was adopted without a division.

                            monies paid by them at the request of the Governor as interest on State
                            Bands with interest on the amount so paid, with a recommendation that it

                            do his duty without regard to party surroundings; but as this is an
                            important question, which was sprung upon the Senate only yesterday, he
                            moved that the consideration of the bill and amendment be made the
                            special order for to-morrow week.

                         BANK OF THE STATE OF INDIANA. 
                        Mr. HENRICKS from the Committee on Banks, reported
                            again to the House the bill [S.
                                29,] to authorize the Bank of the State of Indiana to reduce
                            the capital stock of branches thereof, and to close up branches under
                            the act of 1855-without amendment, and with a recommendation that the
                            same do pass; and, on his motion, the bill was considered on the third
                            reading.
                        The bill having been read the third time by the Clerk-
                        Mr. HENRICKS. The object of the bill was merely to authorize branches of
                            the Bank of the State to close up their business, or reduce their
                            capital stock to $25,000 or to merge into National Banks. The latter
                            course was contemplated by the late bill. The bill also provided that
                            three members of the Board, instead of five, shall constitute a
                            quorum.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, said the committee was unanimous in the
                            recommendation reported.
                        Mr. BOYB. Would the banks accept?
                        Mr. HENRICKS. It was got up by the banks themselves, and will not go into
                            effect till they do accept.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The fact that it had been suggested by the Banks admonished
                            us to proceed with caution in a matter of such grave importance. He
                            moved that its further consideration be postponed, and that it be made
                            the special order for to-morrow.
                        Mr. HENRICKS acquiesced, and the bill was passed over.

                         SCHOOL FUND. 
                        Mr. EMERSON submitted a resolution reciting that, whereas, the common
                            school law provides that county officers having charge of the common
                            school funds shall not be allowed to loan more than $300 to one man; and
                            whereas, it is impossible to loan said fund under said restriction;
                            therefore-

                                        particular, and report, &c.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the resolution by extending the inquiry
                            into the expediency of investing the common school funds in bonds of the
                            United States. 
                        The resolution and proposed amendment were referred to the

                        It was adopted.
                    


                    
                         PORTRAIT OF DOUGLAS. 
                        Mr. WHITESIDE submitted a resolution to the effect that David Stevenson,
                            State Librarian, on the expiration of big term of office, soon to occur,

                            Douglas, unless the sum of $10 be paid to Him, therefore;
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the State Library be instructed to inquire and
                                        ascertain whether Mr. Stevenson has a right to remove any

                        It was referred to the Committee on the State
                            Library.

                                    WHEREAS, There is an unusual amount of
                                        legislation necessary to be performed by this General
                                        Assembly; and whereas, it cannot be done by a regular
                                        session, unless the greatest diligence is exercised by
                                        officers and members; therefore-


                                    
                                        Resolved, (The Senate concurring) that to
                                        avoid an extra session, and to save "unnecessary expense to
                                        Members and the State, all Standing and Special Committees
                                        be requested to use all possible diligence and despatch in
                                        examining and reporting business back for final action. 
                                
                            
                        


                         Mr. WHITESIDE proposed to amend by way of substitute, to the effect
                            following: That, in order to enable the committees to accomplish the
                            work devolving on them, this House will hold but one session per day
                            commencing at 2 o'clock P. M. 
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, submitted the following amendment, by way of
                            substitute:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That for the purpose of enabling
                                        committees to properly consider and mature such matters as
                                        may be referred to them, this House hold but one session
                                        each day, to commence at two o'clock P. M., until otherwise
                                        ordered.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. WHITESIDE withdrew his amendment.
                        Mr. SHUEY said, under the rules, bills and resolutions could not be
                            offered but before twelve o'clock. If this rule were adopted, he could
                            not see how another bill could be introduced here.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested an amendment of the rules.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed further to amend, by way of substitute, as
                            follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That from this day until the 10th
                                        day of February the House shall meet at 9 o'clock A. M. and
                                        adjourn at 12 1/2 o'clock P. M., at which hour, or at such
                                        other time as the House shall determine, the House shall
                                        adjourn for that day.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. N. said he was in favor of one session a day, and preferred the
                            morning. The Senate meets in the afternoon, and, if the House met in the
                            morning, it would admit of the committees of the two Houses occupying
                            the same rooms.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay. How would the two Houses communicate with each other,
                            if not in session at the same time?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. There would be no trouble on that score.
                        Mr. EMERSON was in favor of the amendment, because of the facility it
                            would afford for getting our mails.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair will entertain the proposition of the gentleman
                            from Marion.
                        It was adopted, and then the resolution as amended was adopted.
                    
                    
                         JOSEPH J. BINGHAM.

                            and especially by what legal right he has drawn money from the, Treasury
                            for public printing, in the absence of legal appropriation for that
                            purpose.
                    
                    
                         SHALL SOLDIERS VOTE?

                                    Resolved, That, the Committee on
                                            Elections be instructed to so amend the
                                        election laws that soldiers absent from the State in the
                                        field may be allowed to vote, fit their place of rendezvous,
                                        for all State and county officers, and report, &c.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to amend the resolution so as to instruct the Committee
                            to inquire into the expediency and constitutionality of such a law.
                        The amendment was agreed to, and so the resolution was adopted.
                        Mr. ATKINSON moved to reconsider the vote just taken, which being agreed
                            to,-He moved to further amend the "resolution by extending" the inquiry
                            into the right to vote by Federal officers.
                        And so the resolution was adopted. 
                    


                    
                         FRAUDULENT VOTING.

                                     Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Elections be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of amending the general election law for the
                                        purpose of preventing fraudulent and illegal voting, and
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        Which was adopted.

                         PENSIONS.
                        Mr. LOPP submitted a concurrent resolution, instructing Senators,
                            &c., in Congress, to use their influence to place the
                            representatives of all persons killed in the war on an equal footing, as
                            to pensions, with those killed in the regular service; but-
                        On the suggestion of Mr. BUSKIRK, he withdrew the preposition, to make it
                            a joint resolution. 
                    


                    
                         COURTS OF CONCILIATION. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire into
                                        the expediency of repealing the law creating Courts of
                                        Conciliation.
                                
                            
                        
                        Which was adopted.
                    
                    
                         FEES AND SALARIES. 
                        Mr. MAJOR submitted the following:
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That in view of the present high
                                        rate of taxation, and probable increase of the same, it is
                                        the duty of this House to enforce the most rigid economy in
                                        the management of the finances of the State ; and therefore,
                                        this House ought to resist any increase of the fees and
                                        salaries of civil officers, other than those where the
                                        necessity is most evident.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, it was referred to the Committee on Fees
                                and Salaries.
                    


                    
                         BOUNTIES-DEBTS CONTRACTED THEREFOR. 

                        Mr. PATTERSON submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            County and Township Business be instructed to
                                        inquire into the expediency of authorizing the Board of
                                        County Commissioners of the several counties of the State,
                                        on application of the proper authorities, or persons, of any
                                        township, or any city, or part of a township, constituting a
                                        sub-district for enrollment, and the assignment of quotas on
                                        calls for troops by the President of the United States, to
                                        offer and pay bounties to persons voluntarily enlisting on
                                        behalf of, and to be credited to, such township, or to such
                                        city or township constituting a sub-district, as aforesaid,
                                        and to levy a special or other tax on the property of such
                                        township or city, or part of a township, for the payment of
                                        such bounties, or any debt that may nave been contracted on
                                        account thereof; and that said committee report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. BROWN did not desire any committee of the House to be encumbered with
                            the labor involved in this resolution. He, said there should be a
                            uniformity of bounties offered throughout the State. Then each locality
                            would receive its just amount of credits for recruits. Otherwise it
                            becomes simply a matter of speculation. He believed the substitute
                            system should be allowed. The State had the authority to determine the
                            manner In which she will raise troops. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM also thought the resolution would work badly, and gave
                            examples, where the Legislature was now called upon to legalize acts of
                            quasi corporations tampering with the taxing power.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, went farther. He would not encourage this
                            local bounty question at all. The larger the city, the worse it was for
                            destroying the equality of credits. He gave examples. He called
                            attention to the inequality of taxing the property of men; in the
                            service to raise bounties to exempt from service men that have stayed at
                            home. There was danger of hasty action in this matter. The system of
                            local bounties ought to be discouraged. He moved to table the
                            resolution, but immediately withdrew it.
                         Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, coincided in the view just taken. He was in
                            favor of a system of taxation on that subject that should be uniform in
                            cities, towns and townships. He preferred to have the matter referred to
                            the Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. TRUSSLER took the same view. Taxation on property uniform throughout
                            the State, it might seem to operate onerously on soldiers in the field,
                            was the only safe rule.
                        Mr. BURNES staged that this system of paying local bounties was grossly
                            unjust in its operation. He should oppose any proposition to legalize
                            such acts in this direction as were illegal.
                        [Here the Speaker suspended business, and for most acceptable
                            information, directed the clerk to read a war bulletin dispatch to
                            Governor Morton, to the effect, that Fort Fisher was captured by assault
                            on the 15th-seven hours hard fighting-our loss about 500 which was
                            received with applause.]
                        Mr. KILGORES moved to lay the resolution on the table, but withdrew it
                            for-
                        Mr. BRANHAM, who hoped it would go to the Committee on
                                Judiciary; and then-
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was referred to the Judiciary
                                Committee. 
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted the following:

                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire and
                                        report to this House, immediately, what legislation is
                                        necessary to protect the citizens of the State from the
                                        ordinance of the city of Indianapolis for the punishment of
                                        persons soliciting enlistments or obtaining substitutes in
                                        said city, and report by bill or otherwise. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. D. thought it necessary that some action should be had in this matter
                            at once. He had, therefore introduced this resolution, although one
                            somewhat similar had been already referred, though not requiring
                            immediate action. He thought the ordinance referred to was most signally
                            unjust. It was we'll known that our troops are discharged here, and this
                            naturally brings and leaves them here to seek for bounties. Then their
                            Common Council here passes this ordinance to prevent outsiders from
                            soliciting any returned soldier to recruit, and punishing such an act by
                            fine and imprisonment. He thought it time that the Legislature should
                            take the city of Indianapolis under its charge, and see whether the
                            rights of citizens of other parts of the State can be affected by them
                            in this way or not. Was the city here to have the pick of our soldiers
                            as soon as they are discharged? These very soldiers, perhaps, came from
                            his county-his township-yet it was assumed that he had not the right to
                            go before such soldiers and ask them if they will not volunteer again
                            for our township. The ordinance he considered unconstitutional.
                            Immediate action was necessary, for it brought upon all men who would
                            solicit recruits the dread, of litigation, and they would do nothing,
                            because desirous not to be brought into the detention and expense of
                            false imprisonment.
                        On reflection, he would prefer to change the reference to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        Mr. BROWN opposed the change of reference. It involved a question to be
                            decided only by men well versed in the law.
                        Mr. CHURCH submitted that the Chairman of the Committee on
                                Corporations was a good lawyer.
                         Mr. HIGGINS said his notion was, that this subject be referred to a
                            special committee.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said we had a similar resolution already referred tax that
                            committee. This might stir them up.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK explained why that committee had not acted. He also preferred
                            a select committee.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB showed how Indianapolis had been deprived of recruits by
                            agents coming up and offering larger bounties. He stated that the
                            benevolence of the city supported many families of soldiers neglected
                            and suffering from the inattention of their counties at home. He did not
                            expect to hear the city maligned on this score, because its Common
                            Council has passed this ordinance to prevent the bounty brokerage by men from counties whose poor
                            were taken care of here, without a reply.
                        Pending the question thereon-
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the Committee on the
                                Judiciary obtained leave to employ a clerk.
                        On the motion of Mr. KILGORE, the Committee on
                                Elections had leave to employ a clerk.
                        On the motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House (at 12:15) adjourned till
                            to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                    

                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        WEDNESDAY, January 18, 1865.
                    
                    The reading of yesterday's journal was commenced.
                    On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    Leave of absence was obtained for Mr. Davis.

                    
                         PETITIONS. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Hamilton, presented a petition, numerously signed, praying
                            for the enactment of a law to suppress tippling houses, which was
                            referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                         Mr. CORBIN presented a petition praying for relief in a case where swamp
                            land had been entered by mistake, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Swamp Lands.
                    


                    
                         GERMAN IN COMMON SCHOOLS. 
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK returned from the Committee on
                                Education a Senate resolution of inquiry as to the
                            propriety of teaching the German language in common schools, with a
                            report setting forth "that they deem further legislation on the subject
                            at present inexpedient."
                        The report was concurred in.
                    


                    
                         AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION. 
                        Mr. NILES, from the Judiciary Committee, reported
                            joint resolutions, [S. 2 and 3 ]see pages 33 and 34 of the BREVIER
                            LEGISLATIVE REPORTS-recommending passage.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES. 
                        By direction of the Judiciary Committee the following
                            described Senate bills were returned to the file, with reports
                            recommending passage.
                        Mr. Cobb's [2] regulating practice on appeals.
                         Mr. Corbin's [10] amending
                            section 322 of the practice act.
                        Mr. Hordes [12] authorizing collection of claims before due.
                        Mr. Brown, of Wells, [16] amending section 349 of practice act.
                        The committee recommended that the bill S. 22-see page 38 of these
                            Reports-lie on the table.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN, from the Committee on Finance, returned a
                            petition praying for compensation for bringing fugitives to justice,
                            with a recommendation that the Committee on County and Township
                                Business bring in a bill authorizing County Commissioners
                            to pay for such service.
                        Which reports were severally concurred in.
                    

                    
                         THE SENATE RULES. 
                        Mr. DUNNING gave notice that he should move to amend the rules for the
                            government of the Senate, as follows:
                        
                            
                                55. The phrase "Orders of the day," as used in the 53d Rule,
                                    shall be construed to include, first, messages from the House
                                    requiring action on the part of the Senate; second, bills on
                                    second reading; third, bills on third reading, and these shall
                                    & acted on in the order above enumerated unless the Senate
                                    otherwise direct. 
                            
                            
                                56. When the consideration of a subject shall be assigned for a
                                    particular day, by order of the Senate, the matter so assigned
                                    shall be designated as the special order of the day, and if
                                    several subjects shall be thus assigned for the same day, they
                                    shall be designated as the special orders of the day for that
                                    day, and any matter so assigned shall be a privileged question
                                    for the day named in the order of assignment.
                            
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT said: Notice is given that on to-morrow I will propose a
                            change in the 53d Standing Rule of the Senate, providing that
                            resolutions of the Senate shall stand last in the order of business.
                    
                    
                         REPAYING MONEYS BORROWED BY THE GOVERNOR. 
                        The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            hour-2 1/2 o'clock-being the bill [S.
                                49] directing the Treasurer of State to refund Winslow, Lanier
                            & Co., monies paid by them, at the request of the Governor, as
                            interest on the State debt, with interest on the amounts so paid; the
                            question being on the amendment, offered yesterday afternoon, striking
                            out from the enacting clause and inserting new matter, appropriating
                            $640,000 to pay interest due on the State debt.
                        Mr. HORD. The bill under consideration is one of momentous interest to
                            this State, as it covertly unfolds a revolutionary principle that may
                            drag us to future misfortune, and sting the vitals of our State. That
                            principle so secreted in the bill, is opposed to the nature and spirit
                            of our popular government, to the safety of the people, and to the long
                            existence of a representative system. Two years ago the Republican party
                            in the General Assembly, with the approbation of the Executive of the
                            State, in defiance of propriety, their dignity and law, locked their
                            hearts against duty, and with an air of scorn left their seats,
                            abandoning all concern in legislative matters, and thereby disorganized
                            and dissolved the Legislature. They prevented the passage of all
                            necessary appropriation bills, and defeated other measures of vital
                            interest to the public weal. The Democratic members were at all times
                            ready to vote for the required appropriations and continue an anxiety to
                            promptly meet such duty. After the opposition had dissolved the
                            Legislature under the stained badge of revolution, without any provision
                            being made for the current liabilities of the State, the Governor
                            attempted to provide for the payment of the interest on the State debt
                            in an illegal manner through Lanier & Co.
                        The public welfare did or did not, in the opinion of the Governor,
                            require the payment of the interest on said debt. If he entertained that
                            opinion, then the Constitution of the State, in Article 4, Section 9,
                            required him to call by proclamation a special session of the
                            Legislature to meet the emergency; and he had the legal authority to
                            make this arrangement, but the representatives of the people in the
                            General Assembly could furnish the only remedy. ir this is to be created
                            into a precedent, legislatures will be a useless excrescence in the
                            State.  You unite legislative and
                            executive power in one hand, and if we tamely pass over this occurrence,
                            we embolden the Executive to a perpetration of future excesses,
                            believing in an amiable and humble submission to every violation of law
                            or duty on his part.
                        We should be jealous of any disobedience to law by officers, as the
                            example creates a looseness in the masses. And especially in this time
                            of war, when there is a great laxity in the general obedience to the
                            reasonable dictates of law we should be particular. A spirit of
                            disobedience fills the air; license and libertinism, in all things, find
                            but little restraint in law. Once respected but now contemned, it lies
                            bleeding, trampled and beaten by the hand that should have been raised
                            in its protection. There is no one left to lift it from its broken
                            State, unless this body will reach forth its hand and wipe from it all
                            stain of its shameless fall, and place it erect upon its pedestal for
                            general respect and obedience. Liberty and law go hand in hand. Smite
                            one, and the other falls with its face in the dust. And it would be
                            meting out but just chastisement for this disobedience to law, in
                            interfering in our public affairs without legislative permission, if we
                            should refuse any repayment. If the money was paid without request of
                            any one authorized to make such request, the gentlemen seeking this
                            appropriation could not voluntarily pay our debt and become our
                            creditors.I am willing, however, to do justice in this matter. I am
                            willing to vote back the money devoted to the benefit of the State,
                            provided there is something in the bill to show that it is not to be
                            construed into any precedent to guide future action. I have some
                            objections to the measure originally introduced; it requires the State
                            to pay interest upon interest at the rate of seven per cent. All that
                            could be asked would be interest at the rate prescribed in the bonds,
                            which I understand is from two and a half to five per cent. I am anxious
                            that right should be done--that the persons advancing this money should
                            be reimbursed--but I do not desire to sanction the principle involved in
                            this matter of permitting the Executive to&deal with State affairs
                            in this way, when there exists & constitutional remedy providing for
                            the payment of the public debt and interest.
                        Mr. BENNETT. I do not know, sir, that an elaborate discussion of this
                            question is necessary to secure the great object sought to be obtained
                            by the passage of this bill. Neither do I flatter myself that I am
                            competent to the task of such a discussion; but, sir, I represent a
                            people on this floor, who feel a deep interest on the issue of the
                            question involved in this measure, And I would not meet their
                            expectations did I fail to do all in my power to secure the passage of
                            the bill now before the Senate. I shall no detain the Senate long, nor
                            retain the floor from older and abler Senators than myself.- And before
                            I present any of the reasons why I shall vote for this measure, I desire
                            to dispose of, so far as I am concerned, all political feeling that may
                            have, to some extent, intwined self around this question and in some
                            degree, perhaps, influenced the action of Senators. I think this is not,
                            and so far as I am concerned, it shall not be a political question. I
                            take it that this question is one that rises far above ill party
                            considerations, and I shall attribute to no Senator sentiments governed
                            less by patriotic motives than I shall claim for myself.
                        A service of three years and eight months in the army, has convinced me
                            that no party can arrogate to itself all the precious blood spilled in
                            this great contest-this second war of independence. I have had the honor
                            to serve under Democratic and Republican Generals. I have had the high
                            and glorious honor to lead Indiana's gallant sons, Republicans and
                            Democrats, upon more than a score of bloody fields, and I know no
                            difference in their loyalty, their patriotism, and their valor. They
                            never stop to inquire the politics of their officers, nor of each other.
                            They do not ask to what party the men in the front or rear rank, on the
                            right or ,he left belong-but with their eyes fixed upon, ind their
                            hearts devoted to the great object to be attained, they move steadily
                            forward, a band of brothers.
                        Then, I beg of Senators, here at home, surrounded by all the comforts of
                            life, acting under obligations of the highest and most honorable
                            character, to be governed by a like spirit. To my Union friends I say
                            let us approach this question and all others, as becomes our great name,
                            and worthy of the great cause for which we profess an especial
                            championship. And to my Democratic friends I can appeal in the name of
                            your great leaders--your Jefferson, your Jackson, and your Douglas-who,
                            as they left here and entered yonder, bequeathed to you a prouder legacy
                            than was ever left by Roman Senator, to noble son.
                        It is unnecessary to review the causes which led to a failure to
                            appropriate money to pay the interest on the State debt. These questions
                            have had their day, and played their part in the political contests of
                            this State, and have been passed on by the people. And I shall only say
                            that I hope every man in the State has been fully satisfied in his
                            desire for factious legislation in Indiana, and that his taste for
                            "bolting" has been fully gratified. For myself, I am ready to vote for a
                            law to punish "bolting" hereafter the same as "bounty jumping." 
                        It is, however, sufficient to state that the Legislature of 1863
                            adjourned without making appropriations to pay the interest on the State
                            debt. And that the Treasurer of State refused to furnish the money from
                            the State Treasury, to make such payment, for the reason that no such
                            appropriation was made. That Governor Morton made arrangements with the
                            House of Winslow, Lanier & Co, of the city of New York, to pay such
                            interest. That they did pay such interest as the same matured upon the
                            State bonds of indebtedness, on the 1st of July, 1863, the 1st of June,
                            1864, the 1st of July, 1864, and the 1st of January, 1865, amounting to
                            the sum of $640,000. That by this bill it is proposed to pay back this
                            money to Winslow, Lanier & Co., with interest at the rate of seven
                            per cent, per annum. This I believe to be a plain statement of the whole
                            case.
                        [Mr. B. then entered into an argument to prove that the State Treasurer
                            was at fault in not promptly paying interest on the State debt as it
                            became due; quoting largely from a pam-  phlet issued by Governor Morton, on the
                            25th of April, 1863, in support of that opinion.]
                        Should the Governor have paid no attention to the matter, and let the
                            credit of the State be ruined by a failure to meet its obligations? Not
                            a Senator on this floor but will scorn the idea, and with me declare
                            that our Governor would have shown himself unfit to be the Governor, of
                            one of Guano Islands instead of the great Commonwealth of Indiana, had
                            he so acted. Then all parties must agree that he did right in making the
                            arrangement he did, and I believe all will concede the justice of a
                            payment of this money to Winslow, Lanier & Co. But some Senators are
                            disposed to refuse the payment of. interest on the sum advanced by
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co. If they are entitled to the money advanced,
                            they are certainly entitled to a reasonable interest thereon. If the
                            interest had not been paid on the State debt by Winslow, Lanier &
                            Go., the same would have drawn compound interest at the rate of 7 per
                            cent, after maturity. So it seems to me that paying them 7 per cent, for
                            saving: the credit of the State, is preferable to paying 7 per cent,
                            after, the credit of the State is ruined by a failure to pay. Beside, it
                            is a well established principle of law, that the purchasers of
                            merchantable paper are entitled to the interest allowable in the State
                            where payable, so that, viewing these parties as purchasers merely, they
                            are entitled to the 7 per cent., interest for they had a clear right to
                            purchase to prevent repudiation, on the doctrine of super
                                protest. Beside, the State realized a large portion of this
                            interest, by the investment of the funds that should have been used to
                            pay the interest on the State stocks, by the Treasurer of State. Messrs.
                            Window, Lanier & Co. have performed an act for which the people of
                            Indiana will be grateful long after all of us are gone, and I am happy
                            to have this opportunity to acknowledge their good services by voting
                            this, their just dues, cheerfully. 
                        Another reason why we should meet this question promptly and fully is,
                            that the people of Indiana have, by an overwhelming majority, instructed
                            us to endorse the action of His Excellency, the Governor of the State,
                            in reference to this matter. Sir, I undertake to say, that never since
                            the history of the State, has any political question been more fully
                            discussed than this one, more fully understood by the people, and more
                            decidedly determined at the ballot-box. This subject was most ably and
                            fairly submitted to the tribunal of the people at the October election.
                            And in almost every county in the State Governor Morton was ahead of his
                            ticket upon this very question. While His Honor, the President of this
                            Senate, possessed all the elements of popularity calculated to win the
                            people, added to superior qualifications, and a character unimpeachable,
                            he had the prestige of a splendid military record, yet Governor Morton
                            ran ahead of him in almost every county. Sir, never was the official
                            conduct of any man more signally indorsed than was his. And it was right
                            that it should be. At the head of affairs of our noble State and a
                            period of great trial, he has successfully carried us through all the
                            perils that have beset us; and to-day the civil war that threatened to
                            envelope us in common ruin has passed away leaving us in peace and
                            quiet. The financial ruin that seemed inevitable has been stayed and, as
                            I hope, forever. Let us, then, pass this act, and say to the country
                            that we love on State, the mother of us all, better than we love our
                            party. Let us say to the Governor, that while some of us may differ with
                            him in politics, we can yet rise sufficiently above party bands to do
                            him justice. But above all let us not fail to carry out the will of the
                            great people of Indiana, whose servants we are. Then each one of us can
                                say, 'Exegi monumentum aere perenius.'
                        
                        Mr. WILLIAMS had been familiar with the halls of legislation for about
                            twenty-three years, and had never yet seen such an attempt as this to
                            pass an appropriation. The amount proposed by the Senator from Vigo [Mr.
                            Hanna] is worded in the usual form. He wanted to pass bills in the usual
                            way, but was not willing to legalize that kind of management in getting
                            the money. He reviewed the bill carefully, and proceeded to show wherein
                            it departed from precedents heretofore established. He also complimented
                            the Treasurer of State, and ventured the assertion that Mr. Brett would
                            account for more moneys made by the office for the State than any of his
                            predecessors and the speaker would not be surprised if time proves that
                            Mr. B was a better keeper of the public funds than those who may follow
                            him.
                        Mr. CULLEN. The Senator from Knox [Mr .Williams] takes exception to the
                            manner in which this bill is drawn. The circumstances are different from
                            any existing heretofore, and hence the whereases in this bill are
                            correct and proper. They simply state what are facts, and what harm can
                            there be to the Democratic party or any other set of gentlemen, from
                            introduction in the body of the bill the facts as they exist? There were
                            moneys locked up in the State Treasury to pay the interest on the State
                            debt but by deficient legislation--whether this or that party is
                            responsible, I am not going to stop to argue--these debts were not paid.
                            Then the question is, whether we will ratify the act of Governor Morton
                            in paying these debts? I undertake to say that the people of the State,
                            by over 20,000 majority, have ratified it; we come here as their
                            servants, and that man is unjust to the people who will refuse to
                            sanction the acts of Governor Morton in this matter. I have been a
                            Democrat, and never cast any other vote until the commencement of this
                            rebellion, but my constituency elected me to stand by Governor Morton,
                            and I come here for that purpose. Upon this question, more than the
                            other, was Governor Morton re-elected, and becomes us to echo the voice
                            that comes up all over the State. That man who will not start up here
                            and pay this money with interest, as you would an honest debt from
                            yourself your neighbor-that man will be repudiated by the people of
                            Indiana, wherever he goes, and he ought to be, sir. It is just as proper
                            to pay 7 per cent, interest for this money as it is to pay the debt
                            itself. The last Legislature was the most disgraceful that ever
                            disgraced the State of Indiana, and Governor Morton did right to not
                            calling them back herein extra session; but  upon that question this vote does not
                            hang. Neither is the legal question to be decided by this Senate. Let us
                            lay aside politics and come up and pay our honest debt, and pay the
                            interest on it too, and then this question is disposed of.
                        Mr. DOWNEY. There are some questions effect that I do not fully
                            understand in regard to this matter, ; which if they were understood
                            might enable us to progress with this question a little more
                            satisfactory, and I presume Senators who have this bill in charge can
                            answer. In the first place I desire to know whether this was a payment
                            for us on cur indebtedness, or whether there was a transfer by those who
                            held evidences of our indebtedness to Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co.,
                            and whether they hold our obligations in the nature of assignees or not.
                            Whether the evidences of our indebtedness were transferred to Messrs.
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co.; or whether without a transfer they made this
                            payment of our debt?
                        Mr. CHAPMAN. They were assigned.
                        Mr. HANNA. It appears these evidences were transferred, and by them
                            assigned to the Treasurer of State, and are now in his possession, held
                            by him.
                        Mr. DOWNEY. The reason I ask this question is this: I understand a
                            portion of these bonds are drawing interest at the rate of 2 1/2 and
                            another at 5 percent. If it was merely a transfer then they would stand
                            in the place of bondholders and be entitled to draw the same rate of
                            interest upon these evidences of indebtedness which have been
                            transferred to them. The force of my inquiry will be seen when I state
                            this as a principle I suppose to be applicable in such a cases. If a
                            person holds an evidence of debt which I gave him and he transfers it to
                            some one else, I suppose that assignee would be entitled to recover from
                            me the amount this evidence of debt calls for, and not a greater amount.
                            There is another question I would like answered. I see from the recital
                            in the preamble to this act that it is stated this arrangement is made
                            by Governor Morton. I would be glad to be informed whether Governor
                            Morton has agreed to pay seven per cent, on the monies advanced.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN. I am informed by the Governor that he made no arrangements,
                            but left it to the good faith of the State.
                        Mr. DOWNEY. In reference to the statement that the last was the worst
                            Legislature ever convened in Indiana, I have nothing to say, having been
                            a member of that body myself, except that there was no duty incumbent
                            upon me at that time, which I was not willing, ready and anxious to
                            perform. This money has been paid without any legal authority for it,
                            and as far as the matter of law is concerned, unless Lanier & Co.
                            can be regarded as assignees, there is no legal obligation resting upon
                            us. I, for one, am willing to vote an Appropriation for the purpose of
                            paying this interest; but it does occur to me that if these gentlemen
                            are to be regarded as assignees of the obligations of the State, as
                            having acquired their rights from an assignment made by bondholders, and
                            without any agreement on the part of Governor Morton, or anyone else,
                            that they are to have any greater amount of interest than named in the
                            bonds, they would not be entitled to have this seven per cent. If the
                            amendment shall not be adopted, I shall be in Favor of amending the
                            original bill so as to require that these evidences of indebtedness
                            shall be presented to the Auditor of State,, and when it has satisfied
                            himself that they ought to be paid, that, he draw his warrant upon the
                            Treasurer, in order that the accounts of these officers shall be kept in
                            the usual manner. I want it understood that I shall attempt to vote
                            right on this question, but it seems to me there is no obligation on us
                            to pay these gentlemen more than the rate of interest named in these
                            bonds.
                        Mr. CASON followed, reciting the history of the doings in the last
                            Indiana House of Representatives; denouncing the military bill of that
                            session as revolutionary in its character, and charging that it was
                            brought forth in sin and conceived in the Knights of the Golden Circle
                            for the purpose of carrying out their hellish acts of treason. The bill
                            had been passed to its engrossment, and we had either to see revolution
                            inaugurated, or take the only remedy we had left, and bolt. I did bolt,
                            and it is one, of the proudest acts of my life, and I care not who says
                            any thing, against it. I went back to my constituency and told them I
                            bolted, and that I never would go back to the Legislature and permit
                            that bill to come up without bolting;-you have my case; you can endorse
                            it or let it alone, I care not a continental d-n. They took me out of
                            bed, and endorsed my acts by a thousand more votes than ever before. It
                            was the first bolt I ever made, and I hope to God it will be the last.
                            Mr. C. justified the Governor's determination not to recall that
                            Legislature, and concluded by referring to; Mr. State Treasurer Brett in
                            complimentary terms.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK gave the history of, the progress of the military bill in
                            the House of Representatives last session; made frequent reference to
                            the Clerk's journal by way of substantiating his assertions, and
                            insisted that the people of the State have sustained the course pursued
                            by the minority in that body. Their action was prompted by a desire to
                            preserve the honor of the State and prevent her soil from being drenched
                            in the blood of our own citizens. We owe it to ourselves, to the State,
                            to the Government and to the flag that has proudly been borne by
                            Indiana's brave sons upon an hundred battlefields-we owe it to them, to-
                            posterity, and to every thing that is good, to come forward and do what
                            the better dictates and judgment of the heart of every Senator prompts
                            to do-appropriate moneys to pay the interest upon a debt the State
                            justly owes. We ought to live above party considerations, and do what
                            every pure and noble principle would prompt us to do in the matter.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that this was not a question of politics, nor of
                            strict law, but it was a mere question of right and wrong to be
                            determined by the plainest principles of justice. The obligations of the
                            State consists of certificates of indebtedness, with interest, payable
                            semi-annually. We failed to pay the interest when due. Were the original
                            creditors presenting the claims, we should all agree that they were
                            entitled not only to the semi-annnal interest, but to interest on the
                            interest, and  that, not at two and
                            a half or five per cent., but at a reasonable rate. Though as a question
                            of strict law, between individuals, compound interest is not
                            recoverable. Winslow, Lanier & Co., as friends of the State, saved
                            our credit, and now ask that we refund to them their money, with seven
                            per cent interest. The claim is reasonable and just. Let us refuse to
                            pay it, and no citizen of Indiana can travel, as such, in any country in
                            Christendom, and hold up his head as an honest man. Credit, public or
                            private, is extremely sensitive. A breath can blast it. And he trusted
                            that we should not, for the mere purpose of saving a few dollars in our
                            pockets, destroy ours.
                        Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend the amendment by adding the following:
                        "And also that the Treasurer of State pay to Wins-low, Lanier & Co.,
                            on account of moneys advanced by them to pay the interest on the State
                            debt, seven per cent, on the amount of money so advanced by them." 
                        Mr. HANNA obtained the floor, but gave way for-
                        Mr. CASON, who moved that the Senate adjourn till to-morrow morning at 9
                            o'clock.
                        The motion was agreed to.

                            recommendation, that it will be laid on the table, and 200 copies
                            printed for the use of members of the House of Representatives.
                        Mr. WOODS, from the Committee on Mileage reported the
                            particular number of miles travel for which they recommended that each
                            member of the House of Representatives be credited with mileage. The
                            report was concurred in, and it was ordered that the amounts so allowed
                            be placed to the credit of each member.
                    

                    
                        SUBSTITUTE BROKERAGE ORDINANCE.
                        The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the unfinished business of
                            yesterday, viz; Mr. Dunham's resolution relative to the Indianapolis
                            substitute brokerage ordinance, on which three motions were pendingone
                            to refer it to the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            another to refer it to the Committte on Corporations,
                            and another to refer it to a select committee, with instructions to
                            report early.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK trusted the matter would be referred to a select committee,
                            as the most expeditious course. There were persons here now desiring to
                            obtain substitutes, but durst not act because of the city ordinance. 
                        The motions to refer to the Committee on the Judiciary
                            and the Committee on Corporations were rejected.
                        The resolution was then referred to a select committee.

                        RAlLROAD TAXATION.
                        Mr. MEREDITH submitted the following:

                                            Ways and Means be instructed to inquire
                                        whether it would not be more just and equal to tax railroads
                                        on the amount of their gross receipts, than by the present
                                        mode of tabing them by the mile; and that, it expedient, to
                                        provide for the same by submitting a bill for that purpose;
                                        and in the same connection to consider if upon such gross
                                        receipts the amounts paid by any railroad upon bonds,
                                        &c., given for money borrowed to construct such roads,
                                        should not be allowed as a deduction.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    

                    
                         ACTS OF CONGRESS.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted an order by way of resolution, requesting the
                            Secretary of State to furnish each member that may desire it, a copy of
                            the acts of Congress, from the extra copies of the acts of Congress in
                            his possession. He said he had understood that quite a number of copies
                            of acts of Congress encumbered the shelves in the Secretary's
                            office.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Was there not a law proscribing how these acts shall be
                            distributed?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. They have been furnished according to law.
                        Mr. SHUEY proposed to refer it to the Committee on the
                                Library.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend, so as to send them to the township
                            libraries.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH trusted that the amendments would be voted down, and that we
                            may have square vote on the resolution.
                        Mr. Shuey's motion was rejected.
                        Mr. BURNES moved that Mr. amendment be laid on the table.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        The resolution was then adopted.

                                    Resolved, (the Senate concurring,) That a

                         Mr. BUSKIRK. This was not the first instance of a similar complaint; and
                            it had been necessary for the House to retaliate. But it might be better
                            to appoint a committee as proposed by the gentleman from Perry.

                        AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
                        Mr. BRANHAM gave notice of amendment of Rule 55, viz: adding these
                            words:
                        "Provided, That revenue and appropriation bills, first
                            of the House, next of the Senate, shall have precedence in the orders of
                            the day, except unfinished business."

                        Mr. STIVERS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire whether
                                        there is any provision in the statute authorizing the taxing
                                        of school land; which have been sold on a credit often
                                        years, for the time intervening between the date of the sale
                                        and the time of making the deed, and if not, to report a
                                        bill making such lands taxable, and defining the mode by
                                        which said taxes can be collected.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        PENSIONS.
                        Mr. LOPP introduced a joint resolution [No. 10] instructing our Senators
                            and requesting our Representatives in Congress to cast their influence
                            and votes in favor of a law placing all persons injured or killed, and
                            their widows and minor children, upon the pension roll of the United
                            States upon an equal footing with those injured or killed in the regular
                            service, which was passed to the second reading. 
                    
                    
                        ABSTRACT OF FEES AND SALARIES.
                        Mr. THATCHER submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, A resolution has been adopted by
                                        this House requiring the Committee on Fees and
                                            Salaries to make and report an abstract of all
                                        the fees and salaries of the various State and County
                                        officers of the State: Therefore, 
                                    Resolved, That said committee be authorized
                                        to employ a clerk to prepere said abstract; and that while
                                        said clerk shall be so employed, he shall receive the same
                                        pay allowed to other clerks of this House.
                                
                            
                        
                         It was adopted.
                    
                    
                        BANK OF THE STATE.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK now called up the bill [S.
                                29] to authorize the Bank of the State of Indiana to-  reduce the capital of branches,
                            &c., which was postponed yesterday on the motion and made a special
                            order for to-day. He said, on examination, he was not very favorably
                            impressed with it.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Brown in the chair) said the question was on the final
                            passage of the bill. It was read the third time yesterday.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. Did the Journal show that fact?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested reading, except the last section.
                         I was read again by the Clerk.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. He was opposed to the bill on principle. It was its evident
                            purpose to enable the branches of the Bank to wind up and go into
                            national banks. By a provision of the original charter their directors
                            could not be at the same time directors of any other bank. Some of the
                            branches might be sincerely desirous of closing business, but he
                            supposed the single object to be to merge into national banking, He had
                            no confidence in that system of banking, and on that ground was opposed
                            to the bill. He would have no objection to allow them to wind up.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB was not surprised at the opposition of a gentleman opposed to
                            all banks, and professing no confidence in any. This was a serious
                            proposition to decrease the number of branches, and all knew the bank
                            was withdrawing its circulation.
                        Mr. PUETT thought the gentleman might forget his opposition, if he would
                            reflect on the amount of capital employed by the men here asking the
                            privilege to wind up. The bill was well guarded. And supposing they
                            desire to go into national banking, should they not have the right to do
                            so? For his part, he had the utmost confidence in the system of National
                            Banks. He had invested what he could in it, and wished tie had the
                            ability to invest as much more.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, was decidedly in favor of the passage of the
                            bill. Those, in whose judgment he had great confidence, had assured him
                            it was all right.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted that the bill, in case of the closing of a branch,
                            did not continue the liability of all the stockholders, as provided ia
                            the original charter. While it continued the liabilities of the
                            stockholders winding up, it seemed to relieve from their liability the
                            stockholders cf other branches. It was suggested to him that there was a
                            constitutional provision requiring these liabilities. He did not like
                            the phraseology. He moved that it be referred to the Committee
                                on the Judiciary, with instructions to inquire whether the
                            third resolution interferes with liability.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. The constitutional provision would override
                            any such interference by the Legislature.


                        Mr. NEWCOMB read the 3d section. He could not see anything here to
                            relieve from liabilities imposed in the charter of the back. The bill
                            was not open to the objection of the gentleman from Monroe. It was not
                            in the power of this House to change the Constitution.
                        Mr. SPENCER moved to lay it on the table and print two hundred
                            copies.
                        Mr. HENRICKS called for the reading of the 5th section of the 10th
                            article of the State Constitution.
                        It was read by the Clerk.



                        


                        The pending motions were rejected; and the yeas and nays being taken on
                            the final passage of the bill, resulted--yeas 68, nays 17--as follows:

                        So the bill passed the House of Representatives: Whereupon, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Ordered, That the Clerk acquaint the Senate

                                     WHEREAS, The present revenue laws are
                                        unequal in their operation, insomuch that some species of
                                        property are burdened with a greater proportion of taxes
                                        than others; therefore-
                                    Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                            Committee be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of so amending the revenue laws as to insure a
                                        more equitable distribution of taxes, and report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.

                            embracing statement of receipts and disbursements since he came into
                            office.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved to lay on the table and print.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said the law provides for the printing.

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Ways and Means be instructed to make a
                                        sufficient appropriation in the general bill on that subject
                                        to pay the expenses of witnesses and others, growing out of

                                            Arrests, created at the last session of the

                                            Committee on Rights and
                                        Privileges.
                                
                            
                        
                    



                    
                         TOWNSHIP ASSESSORS.
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the regular order of business was dispensed
                            with, and the House took up the consideration of bills on the second
                            reading.
                        Mr. Groves's bill [H. R. 10] to provide increased compensation for
                            township assessors coming up for consideration- Mr GRIFFITH proposed to amend, by striking
                            out ''$2 50" and inserting "$3 00" per day.
                        Mr DUNHAM moved to strike out the emergency clause-objecting to attempts
                            to avoid the most reasonable constitutional restrictions, by carrying
                            laws into effect before they are published.

                        Mr. GROVES hoped the emergency clause would not be stricken out. It was
                            now but a short time when the township assessors would be called upon
                            for duty, and as the fees now stood, it was impossible for competent men
                            to be engaged to do the work. No bill before the House needed this
                            clause more than this. The present fees would not pay the tavern bills
                            of the assessor, if he have a horse. He did not want any man acting
                            officially to receive less than a common laborer.
                        Mr. WEIGHT. It was a well known fact that assessors in many counties had
                            refused to receive their commissions upon the plea that it would not pay
                            expenses. Unless the act goes immediately into effect a number of
                            counties would not be assessed at all.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The Committee on Ways and Means had been
                            examining the revenue laws, and they found that a new bill was necessary
                            to embrace all the needed amendments.
                        That bill would contain a provision which would cover this ground. That
                            committee would propose that the assessor's compensation should not
                            exceed a certain amount-that the commissioners should not go above that
                            amount. He hoped soon to be able to report the bill.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the bill and amendments to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH did not like to give this into the hands of the County
                            Commissioners. He had seen cases where they were not willing to give
                            proper compensation. He saw no reason why we should not at once fix it
                            at $3 a day. If the assessor did not earn that, he did not earn
                            anything.
                        Mr. BURNES hoped it would not be referred or amended. It was fairly
                            drawn. It would make the compensation uniform. If there was uncertainty
                            as to compensation, good and competent men could not be found to take
                            the office. If the bill should be passed without the emergency, it fails
                            of its object.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, was in favor of retaining the emergency clause in
                            the case of this bill, but he concurred in the general remark of the
                            gentleman from Floyd.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, thought the diversity of operation by the
                            legislation suggested by the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham]
                            might infringe upon the Constitution. He was in favor of the
                            emergency.
                        Mr. DUNHAM had not been advised of the action of the Committee
                                on Ways and Means, He withdrew his amendment.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB made his motion to refer to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means, that the entire subject might be before that
                            same committee. He proposed to amend by inserting after the words fixing
                            the per diem: "during the years 1865 and 1866." As we shall be called on
                            to increase fees and salaries, he advised that we do not go too far into
                            the future.
                        Mr. WHITE moved to amend by fixing the per diem at two dollars.
                        The bill and amendments were then referred to the Committee on
                                Ways and Means.
                    
                    
                        CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
                        Mr. Stewart's bill [H. R. 11] dividing the State into congressional
                            districts, coming up for consideration-
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to refer the hill to a select committee to be composed
                            of one member from each congressional district.
                        Mr. MEREDITH proposed to print 200 copies.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK accepted.
                        Mr. STEWART. The bill had been prepared with a great deal of care. With
                            regard to population, it equalized the State better than any other that
                            can be made.
                        Mr. DUNHAM (ironically) bore testimony to the correctness of the
                            statement of the gentleman from Rash [Mr. Stewart.] He hoped the bill
                            would go to the Select Committee, and be printed for
                            the edification of the House and the people of the State at large; and
                            above all things else, that it would be printed as a monument of the
                            care and ingenuity of the gentleman from Rush.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH proposed an amendment, and then
                        The motion to refer and print was agreed to.
                    
                    
                         THE THIRTEENTH ARTICLE.
                        The joint resolution. [H. R. 1,] to amend the State Constitution, by
                            striking out the 13th article, coming up 
                        On motion by Mr. MEREDITH, it was referred to the Special
                                Committee on Constitutional Amendments.
                        Mr. Rhoads's joint resolution [H. R. 2,] accepting the grant of lands
                            under act of Congress of July, 1862, (390,000 acres) coming up,
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was referred to the Committee on
                                the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        SCHOOLS.
                        Mr. Woods's joint resolution [H. R. 3] to amend the 8th article of the
                            State Constitution, so as to enable towns and districts to tax
                            themselves for school purposes, coming up-
                        On motion by Mr. WOODS, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Education. 
                        Mr. Wood's joint resolution [H. R. 4,] to amend section 23, article 4 of
                            the State Constitution, so as to provide for laws, that the people of
                            incorporated cities, towns, &c., may tax themselves for the
                            promotion of schools without reference to a uniform rate of taxation,
                            coming up
                        On motion by Mr. WOODS, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Education.
                    

                    
                        RELIGIOUS MEETINGS-FAIRS.

                        Mr. Harrison's bill [H. R. 12,] to amend the first section of the act for
                            the better protection of religious meetings, agricultural fairs,
                            &c., approved March 3, 1850, coming up
                        Mr. SPENCER moved that it be referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary, with instructions to amend it so that it shall
                            not apply to groceries in cities and towns.
                        Mr. HARRISON. It applied only to religious meetings and agricultural
                            fairs. The Supreme Court had decided that the words of the Statute: "If
                            any person shall disturb a reli- ious meeting" does not define a crime. The bill proposed to make it a
                            crime. 
                        It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                    

                    
                        REBEL RAIDS-RELIEF.
                        Mr. Prather's bill [H. R. 13] for the relief of persons who have lost
                            property by rebel raids, &c.--coming up--
                         Mr. SHUEY proposed to amend by adding a, section to the effect, that
                            said commissioners shall first diligently inquire if such complainant or
                            complainants were, or ever have been, members of the order of the Golden
                            Circle, American Knights, Sons of Liberty, or of any other treasonable
                            association; and if such claimant or claimants ever did, by word or act,
                            encourage treason, discourage enlistments, or in any manner give aid and
                            comfort to the enemies of our country,-and if so, then, such claim or
                            claims shall not be allowed, &c.
                        Whereupon followed a debate by Messrs. BROWN and DUNHAM in opposition,in
                            which Mr. KILGORE and others participated,till the hour of adjournment
                            under the resolution of yesterday.
                        So the bill and proposed amendment were passed over informally.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor of
                            State, responding to interrogations propounded by a resolution of the
                            House of Representatives, of yesterday, relative to warrants drawn on
                            the Treasury on account of Public Printing.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK moved an order to print 200 copies.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, that the communication be referred to the Committee
                                on Public Expenditures.
                        
                        Mr. Branham'a motion was agreed to-affirmative 38, negative 35.
                        The SPEAKER annoumced the Committee on Constitutional
                                Amendments, under the resolution by Mr. Reese, viz:
                            Messrs. Reese, Lasselle, Miller of Tippecanoe, Harrison and
                            Meredith.
                        And then-
                        On motion of Mr. SPENCER, [12:50 P. M.]the House adjourned till to-morrow
                            morning 9o'clock.
                    



                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        THURSDAY, January 19, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                     The journal of yesterday was being read, when--
                     On motion by Mr. BONHAM, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.

                    
                        REPAYING MONEY BORROWED BY THE GOVERNOR.
                         The PRESIDET. The business in order is the consideration of the bill
                                [S. 49] pending at the
                            adjournment last evening, authorizing the Treasurer of State to refund
                            to Winslow, Lanier & Co. moneys paid by them as interest on the
                            State debt, the question being on the amendment [Mr. Bradberry's] to the
                            amendment [Mr. Hanna's.] The Senator from Vigo [Mr. Hanna] has the
                            floor.
                        Mr. HANNA. I had not intended nor expected to speak on this question, not
                            being in good health; but there were some things said yesterday by my
                            friend from Boone [Mr. Cason] and other Senators that I cannot let pass
                            by without notice from me. It seems to me Senators have misapprehended
                            the point before the Senate.- The question is a plain one. Whether we
                            shall pay under this bill Lanier & Co. interest upon interest on the
                            money they have advanced? The actual amount we are called upon to pay is
                            $28,527 94. Passing by the circumstance which has led us to the
                            necessity of considering this question-the defection of the fast
                            Legislature-let us look for one moment at the real state of facts now
                            before the Senate. December 1, 1863, Winslow, Lanier & Co. advanced
                            $160,000, and on that sum the interest to January, 1855, amounts to
                            $12,151 28. July, 1864, they advanced $160,000 again, and the interest
                            to January, 1865, amounts to $11,200. June 25, they again advanced
                            $160,000. Of this, there was on hand, on the 1st of January, the sum of
                            $61 830, leaving to be advanced, $98,170, on which they charge interest,
                            $3,550 45; making the whole of their advancements amount to $418,170 00,
                            and the whole amount of interest to January 25, $28,527 94.Mr. CHAPMAN.
                            It is $61,083 64 they have not charged any interest on, which they have
                            deducted from the $160,000, and charged for $98,169 36.
                        Mr. HANNA. Thts will not change the complexion of though in a small
                            degree amending the figures. [Mr. H. then read the form of assignment
                            from bondholders to Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co., and also the
                            assignment of the assignment by this firm to the State Treasurer, to
                            show, as he said, what these men are trying to do for the abolishment of
                            an office created by the State of Indiana.]
                        In answer to the remarks made on yesterday by the Senator from Boone [Mr.
                            Cason] when alluding to the Military bill, which caused the revolution
                            in the House of Representatives last session, he asked what was the
                            state of facts surrounding us ? Members on the other side had determined
                            to organize a Home Guard, and arms were distributed, I am sorry to say
                            and as far as my own locality was concerned, I say, without fear of
                            contradiction, that these arms were distributed to a political party,
                            under a secret organization, called the Union League. I have seen a
                            thousand men, sir, parading through the streets of Terre Haote, and in
                            Vigo county, holding guns owned by the people of the State of Indiana.
                            And more than that, sir, honorable gentlemen of the opposite school of
                            politics from that in which His Excellency is acting, made application
                            under the laws of the State for these guns and they were denied, denied
                            sir, with insults.
                        The people of Indiana were alarmed at this state of facts. They saw no
                            cause for a political party arming themselves throughout the State. And
                            I came here and offered a military bill) and I am willing here or
                            elsewhere to stand up in the discussion of the constitutionally of that
                            bill, if it is necessary to do so. It was offered in good faith by me;
                            and the charge that it was formed in a conclave of Knights of the Golden
                            Circle, come it from whatever quarter it may, I pronounce it here to-day
                            before the Senate and the country, in every word and letter, to be
                            false-false-and false again.  I know
                            no power that will prevent me from sneaking what I conceive to be the
                            truth. Come on with your bastiles, if you will. Erect your gibbets, and
                            pile our trunkless heads mountain high, if you will. And after you may
                            have done all this, the truth will stare you in the face, and the
                            facts-the right and wrong will forever and ever be the same. If you know
                            the truth, speak it, I say, and leave the rest to the God of
                            Destiny.
                        Mr. H. closed by declaring his readiness to care the records of leading
                            men on both sides and pleading that all should stand by the Constitution
                            and laws.
                        Mr. BENNETT. I will ask the gentleman whether that military bill,
                            introduced by you, was prepared wholly or in part by John C. Walker?
                        Mr. HANNA considered the question rather improper, but was willing to say
                            in reply, that be did consult some of the best men in the State, and
                            received suggestions from spins of them. Mr. Walker did not draft the
                            bill, but he did propose some clauses which were incorporated in it.
                        Mr. BENNETT asked if two of the men that were to have charge of the State
                            militia, under that bill, were not members of the Order of the Sons of
                            Liberty?
                        Mr. HANNA. I have ever been against all orders of that kind. I do not
                            know anything about them, and cannot answer the gentleman's
                            question.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. Does the gentleman know of a single instance in which
                            arms were distributed by the State Executive, not in accordance with
                            regulations made in pursuance of law?
                        Mr. HANNA, The question was under discussion in Terre Haute, and an
                            application was made through Mr. Allen, then Auditor of the county, and
                            I am told presented here, and we were told that we could not have the
                            arms, though we complied with the law as near as we could.
                        Mr. OYLER made a general speech in favor of the original bill. It was an
                            act of simple justice to those gentlemen, who came forward and rescued
                            our State from the stain of repudiation on her escutcheon when the dark
                            cloud of treason had settled down upon her. He was surprised that
                            honorable Senators should stand up and talk about the propriety of doing
                            this thing.
                        Mr. CORBIN was in favor of paying the interest on the State debt, but
                            opposed to paying interest upon that interest. He did not look on this
                            as a political question, but regarded it as , it has been put by the
                            Senator from Laporte--upon the question of right and wrong. Not right or
                            wrong to any political party, but right or wrong to the people of the
                            State. It was a maxim that when a party asks equity, he must do equity.
                            Now he asked, if these men that have taken up this party quarrel, and
                            assumed the attitude of advocates for this revolutionary scheme, by
                            helping Governor Morton to carry it out-could they come in before a
                            court of justice with their hands covered with this party slime, and ask
                            that equity be dope to them upon the score of their own right doing?
                            Believing that paying interest upon interest would be but paying a bonus
                            to those who assisted in carrying out a palpable violation of law, he
                            felt compelled to vote against the original bill, and for the
                            substitute.
                        Mr. DUNNING disowned all leaderships, and disclaimed all ambition that
                            way. He was responsible only to bis constituents. It cost him nothing to
                            get into the Republican party, and it would cost him just as little to
                            get out of it. He read from the acts of 1846 and 1847, showing that it
                            was the well settled determination of the people that the State
                            indebtedness shall all be settled up justly and honestly. The lamented
                            Governor Willard set a bad example. It was not right that Government
                            should be run without authority of law; but there were circumstances
                            under which men high in authority must exercise a large discretion in
                            order to preserve the faith of the State. He considered that the
                            opposition to the bill, which he read by sections, arose here more from
                            spite toward the Governor than any indisposition to pay the money
                            advanced or the interest thereon. He closed with general and personal
                            remarks, and rested in the assurance that the bill would pass. He knew
                            it would pass-in the very terms in which it stood before the Senate.
                         Mr. Bradley had leave to withdraw his amendment, but he immediately
                            offered in lieu thereof the following: Strike out from the enacting
                            clause and insert-
                        
                            That the sum of six hundred and forty thousand
                                dollars and such further sum as may be necessary to pay the interest
                                at the rate of seven per cent, per annum on such sums as have been
                                advanced by parties to pay the interest on the State debt is hereby
                                appropriated to pay the interest on the State debt is hereby
                                appropriated to pay the interest due from the State to her
                                bondholders, and upon the passage and approval of this act, that the
                                Auditor of State is directed to draw his warrant on the Treasurer of
                                the State of Indiana in favor of the Treasurer of State for said
                                amounts up to, and including the January interest, A I). 1865, which
                                Paid sum of money is hereby placed under the control of the
                                Treasurer of the State of Indiana, who is authorized, empowered and
                                directed to pay to the owners of the bonds, such interests as may be
                                due thereon, or to the holder or holders of the receipts of such

                                interest as above, to partice making advancements to pay interest on
                                the State debt, and the said Treasurer of State is directed to take
                                proper receipts for such interest or an assignment to the State of
                                receipts, given by the bond-holders for interest due upon our public
                                debt.
                        
                        WHEREAS, An emergency exits for
                                the immediate taking effect of this act, therefore, the same shall

                        Mr. McCLUNG obtained the floor, but gave way for the recess till 2
                            o'clock.

                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        On motion of Mr. MASON, the special order for this hour-being the
                            consideration of the Governor's Message, as in Committee of the
                                Whole-was postponed till to-morrow afternoon, at 2:30

                             WHITLEY COMMON PLEAS.
                            The PRESIDENT announced the committee to which was referred the bill
                                [S. 39] changing the time of holding the Common Pleas Courts in
                                Whitley County, viz : Messrs. Douglas, Noyes and Dykes.
                        
                        
                        
                            THE STATE TREASURY.
                            The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate the annual report of the State
                                Treasurer, embracing a statement of receipts and disbursements, from
                                February 10, 1863, to December 31, 1864; which was laid on the
                                table, and 1,000 copies ordered to be printed for the use of the
                                Senate.
                        
                        
                            MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR
                            Announced. the appointment of Berry R. Sulgrove, Esq , as an
                                Executive Messenger; and the signature of the Governor to a bill
                                    [S. 49] authorizing the
                                Bank of the State or Branches to reduce the capital stock, wind up,
                                &c.
                        

                        
                            REPAYING MONEYS BORROWED BY THE GOVERNOR.
                            The Senate resumed the consideration of the subject pending at the
                                hour of recess for dinner ; the Senator from Clinton being entitled
                                to the floor.
                            Mr. McCLURG. I am in favor of the amendment of the Senator from Floyd
                                [Mr. Bradley,] to the amendment to the original bill. I am willing
                                to regard this question in the abstract as one of right and wrong
                                between the parties. I do not propose to look upon this question as
                                a legal one, but I propose to shape my conduct towards it as a moral
                                one. I am in favor of paying the interest due to bondholders, and
                                interest on the money advanced to pay those debts; but I am opposed
                                to the original bill for the reason it comes to us in the
                                questionable shape it does. I am opposed to the whereases in the
                                bill. The statement made in the preamble is true, but it is not the
                                whole truth, and I am opposed to having a portion only of the truth
                                set forth. If it is set forth that the Legislature failed to make an
                                appropriation, it is nothing but justice that it should also be
                                shown why the appropriation was not made; and if it shows an
                                absolute deriliction of duty by the Auditor and Treasurer of State,
                                let it go farther and show the reason why these officers committed
                                this act of deduction as it is said to be in the preamble to this
                                bill; but there is no necessity for this preamble at all. I
                                understand from the Constitution of the State that the preamble is
                                and can be no part of the bill. I am opposed to this bill on
                                principle. I am not in favor of the amendment offered by the Senator
                                from Vigo, [Mr. Hanna,] because it appropriates only the principle
                                for which the State is liable, and in all business transactions if
                                there is any just cause for the payment of the principal there is
                                for the interest also. I shall act on this principle notwithstanding
                                in doing so I must bow to a political party.
                            [He referred to the history or the Military Bill in the House of
                                Representatives last session, and asserted confidently that it never
                                would have passed the Senate.]
                            We know nothing of secret political conclaves in my district. In all
                                the trying times we have seen since this rebellion commenced the
                                Democracy of my district have stood ; shoulder to shoulder, and have
                                spurned all that would induce a violation of law. When the draft
                                came on we responded, and we responded to the tax collector taking
                                the broad ground that the laws on our statute books must be obeyed.
                                There has been no such thing as an attempt by the Democracy of my
                                district to bring upon the State any revolutionary act, but it maybe
                                when indignity upon indignity has been hurled upon us as a party,
                                and a burning desire of intolerance has swept over our district; in
                                the madness of the hour there may have been some men there that,
                                Samson-like, would have been willing to put their shoulders to the
                                pillars of the temple though they died in its smouldering ruins.
                                Although my heart does not beat one beat in unison with theirs, yet
                                they are men, and human nature was not sufficient to withstand it.
                                But I am happy to say the time of our greatest danger has past,
                                better counsels have prevailed, and to-day that intolerance does not
                                bear quite so hard upon my district as it has. Mr. McClurg closed by
                                assuring Senators the imputation of the gentleman from Monroe [Mr.
                                Dunning] that this discussion was gotten up out of spite against
                                Governor Morton, did not apply to him; on the contrary he
                                complimented the Governor for his care for our soldiers in the
                                field.
                            Mr. ALLISON. Gentlemen in their speeches on this floor ignore
                                political questions, yet they scarcely get well started before they
                                leave the question before the Senate and discuss at length questions
                                of two years ago. He imagined he could see very well the motive
                                prompting gentlemen on the other side. While they seem endeavornig
                                to cover it up, it amounts simply to this: It is to make this
                                Senate, at this session, endorse the action of the Democratic party
                                two years ago. He contended that the officers of State had the legal
                                right to pay the interest on our State debt, and believed if that
                                political case had not been trumped up before that political Supreme
                                Court, the Treasurer of State would have paid over the monies
                                necessary for the semi-annual payments.
                            Mr. COBB asked if the decisions of the Supreme Court are not binding
                                upon citizens of this State.
                            Mr. ALLISON. Ordinarily they are; but let the gentleman answer when
                                he gets up to speak on this question, whether or not this case was
                                not brought before that Court for political effect, and for
                                political effect only. When gentlemen upon the floor of the Senate
                                make a charge so grave as that the Executive of the State furnished
                                arms to a secret political organization, known as the Union League,
                                they should prove it; he demanded the proof, and defied gentlemen on
                                the other side of the house to furnish proof of any such thing as
                                that. [Mr. A. then briefly referred to the military bill, and the
                                action of the last House of Representatives subsequent to its
                                introduction.]
                            Mr. DOUGLAS. It is unpleasant when we should exercise kindness toward
                                each other, that remarks are indulged in here by members
                                representing a noble constituency, who are calculated to alienate
                                each from the other. The discussion has assumed the vilest forms of
                                a political canvass; the last Legislature has been ventilated;
                                gentlemen have gone into secret associations and dug up evidence
                                there, and they have come in here to recite lengthy extracts from
                                political speeches made upon the stump during the last canvass with
                                which they tormented, bored and bedeviled their people at home.
                                [Laughter] And this done here where wisdom should be expected where
                                we  should talk, act and vote
                                like men, and not have a large crowd in the lobbies laughing at our
                                wrangling and ungentlemanly qarrels. This is all wrong; we should
                                have and must have harmony. The question before the Senate is one of
                                right or wrong, shall we pay interest upon interest, or shall we
                                not? He was opposed to paying to strangers a bonus of $30,000 or
                                $40,000 for assisting Governor Morton in his revolutionary measures,
                                but was willing to pay interest which the State justly and lawfully
                                owed.
                            Mr. NOYES, who was a member of the last House, stated that the Union
                                members endeavored to have the necessary appropriation bills
                                introduced early in the session; and cited the remarks of a
                                gentleman who was on the Committee of Ways and
                                    Means, going to show that these bills were kept back
                                for the purpose of getting through the House such legislation as was
                                desired by the majority.
                            Mr. THOMPSON would vote for the bill, and had no serious objection to
                                it, understanding that it is presented as a Democratic and
                                Republican compromise, fixed up in the other end of this building.
                                He admired the remarks made by the Senator from Laporte (Mr. Niles,)
                                and did not wish to detain the Senate from proceeding either in the
                                investigatian of this bill or otherwise. The bill sets forth nothing
                                more nor less than the facts in the case.
                            Mr. T. indulged in some personal remarks of not a very complimentary
                                nature, concerning one of our United States Senators, and concluded
                                by reciting figures to show that the vote of the city of
                                Indianapolis at the late elections was not as large, in proportion
                                to population, as that of many other precincts in the State.
                            Mr. GIFFORD would vote for this appropriation, and for interest at
                                the rate fixed by law in the State of New York, as contemplated in
                                the amendment to the amendment; and in case that failed he would
                                vote for the original bill if the preamble shall be amended so as to
                                strike out the unjust reflections therein cast upon the Democratic
                                party. Referring to the military bill of the last session he said: I
                                am prepared to say from actual knowledge that the bill which seemed
                                to have alarmed the Republican party so much, stood no more chance
                                of passing the Senate at the last session than the Senate was able
                                to turn White river up stream. The matter was fully canvassed, and
                                it was decided in Democratic caucuses at different times that they
                                would not vote for that bill. Hence, if that was the sole ground of
                                their bolting there was no necessity for it.-- The bill would never
                                have received my vote, and I know, from the pledges of other
                                Democratic Senators here, it would never have received their
                                votes.
                            Mr. G. said he would be satisfied with the bill under consideration
                                if the Senate would incorporate in it the following:


                            Provided, That nothing in this act, or in the
                                passage of the same, shall be construed so as to admit a
                                unwillingness on the part of the majority of the Legislature at its
                                session in 1863, to make the necessary appropriation for this
                                purpose; or so as to admit any necessity for the action of the
                                Governor in the matter referred to, or so as to sanction the same as
                                a precedent for future cases.
                            Mr. MASON reviewed the action of the last House on the military bill,
                                and then announced his intention to vote for the substitute offered
                                by the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Hanna,] because he had always been
                                opposed to encouraging any thing like revolution, or members leaving
                                their seats for the purpose of avoiding any matter that may be
                                brought before the Legislature. It is said that this money was
                                expended for the benefit of the State, but strictly speaking the
                                State is not bound for the principle nor the interest.
                            Mr. COBB was not disposed to enter into any political discussion of
                                this question, and if he was his state of health would prevent it.
                                If we pay back to these gentlemen the money they have advanced, we
                                ought also to pay them a reasonable rate of interest for the use of
                                their money; and if the pending amendment be not adopted, he hoped
                                the preamble of the original bill would be modified so as to satisfy
                                Democratic Senators generally. He disclaimed, for the Democratic
                                party, that John C. Walker, Dick Dodd or that class of men were ever
                                leaders in that organization; and insisted that the Democratic party
                                of the loyal States are in no ways responsible for the acts of
                                indiscreet men who may have voted with it, but who have taken up
                                with schemes for the destruction of our government. The Democratic
                                party is loyal, has had its friends upon every battle field, and if
                                it does right, as it will be sure to, two years from now they will
                                be in the majority and the party in power at this day will come up
                                here and do as they did two years ago- disregard the voice of the
                                people of this State.
                            Mr. CORBIN made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to lay both amendments on the table.
                            Mr. NEWTON demanded a division of the queston.

                            
                            The question being first on the amendment [Mr. Bradley's] to the
                                amendment, it was laid on the table, by yeas 29, nays 19--as
                                follows:

                                            Williams-19.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                            The question recurring upon the amendment by way of substitute, [Mr.
                                Hanna's,] it was laid on the table by yeas 33, nays 15,--as
                                follows:

                                            Wood and Wright-33.
                                        NAYS-Messrs. Barker, Bowman, Carson, Corbin, Douglas,

                            Mr. BENNETT then offered an amendment to the preamble of the bill,
                                striking out so such of it as referred to the failure of the last
                                General Assembly to make an appropriation to pay the interest, and
                                to the action of the Auditor and Treasurer of State in consequence

                            Mr. DOWNEY, when his name was called, said: I have intended, from the
                                commencement of this discussion, to vote in favor of an
                                appropriation to repay the money advanced to pay the interest on our
                                State bonds. From the answers of the chairman of the
                                    Committee on Finance, yesterday, I was
                                inclined to regard the transaction as an assignment of the
                                evidences-of our indebtedness to Messrs. Winslow, Lanier & Co.,
                                and that they were entitled to claim only the same rate of interest
                                mentioned in the bonds. Farther inquiry has changed my inclination,
                                and I now regard the transaction as a payment made for us, at the
                                request cf the Governor, and though the State may not be legally
                                bound to pay, I am unwilling to incur the charge of a seeming
                                unwillingness to pay what right and justice may demand, I shall
                                therefore vote for the passage of the bill.
                            Mr. VAWTER, when his name was called, said: I represent a district
                                which gave Governor Morton a majority. The majority then of the
                                district I represent expressed their confidence in the present
                                Executive, and while I was elected as a Democrat, and shall on
                                questions purely political, act with the Democratic party, I feel
                                myself bound by the expressed will of a majority of that district,
                                on matters which are not political, to cast no vote which will cast
                                implied censure upon the Governor who was endorsed by a majority of
                                my Senatorial district. I am proud to acknowledge my obligations to
                                Republicans for a seat in this body. I am a native of Indiana, and
                                by no vote of mine will I ever directly or indirectly refuse to pay
                                a debt which my native State honestly owes. I will not stop to
                                discuss whether Governor Morton and the Republican members of the
                                last House did or did not do right. This is past and gone. We owe
                                this debt, it ought to be paid, and I will never record my vote so
                                as to cast the least shade upon the good character and renown of
                                Indiana. For these reasons I vote aye.
                        

                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                            Was obtained for Mr. Williams till Tuesday. And then the Senate
                                adjourned.
                        
                    
                


                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         THURSDAY, January 19, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER, taking the chair at 9 o'clock A. M., stated the impression of
                        the chair, that there was not a quorum present, and directed a call of the
                        House, which, being executed by the Clerk, a quorum of the House answered to
                        their names.
                    The Journal of yesterday was then read and approved.
                    Mr. HIGGINS obtained leave to withdraw from the files of the House his bill,
                        No. 39.

                    
                        LOCAL BOUNTIES
                        Mr. STINGER presented a petition protesting against unequal assessments
                            for soldiers' bounties, which was referred to the Committee on
                                the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES-INCOMPETENT PHYSICIANS.
                        Mr. BURNES, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges of
                                Inhabitants of the State, to which had been referred the
                            petition of sundry citizens of Huntington, for protection against the
                            practice of medicine and surgery by incompetent persons, reported the
                            same back with the expression of opinion, that legislation thereon at
                            this time is inexpedient, and a motion to indefinitely postpone.
                        Mr. COFFROTH would prefer that some action should ba had on this matter.
                            Other petitions of the same character were coming in. He hoped the House
                            would consent at least that the matter lie on the table.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH was opposed to the indefinite postponement of any matter of
                            so much weight and interest at this. If there way any professions in
                            which a man ought to be thorough, it is medicine. He was surprised at
                            the Committee's apparent eagerness to get rid of this matter.
                        Mr. BURNES had always regarded promptness as a commendable virtue; but he
                            was willing the matter should lie on the table. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. The public was sufficiently protected from imposition in
                            other professions, in virtue of the professions themselves; but there
                            was but little protection against incompetency in a physician. In this
                            he gave the opinion of other betters informed than himself. He moved
                            that the report be laid on the table.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK from the Committee on Corporations, to
                            which had been referred the resolution relative to substitute brokerage,
                            returned the same with a recommendation that it be referred to the
                            select committee on that subject.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. JAMES, from the Committee on Corporations, to
                            which had been referred the memorial, with the draft of a bill, by the
                            Common Council of the city of Lafayette, with a recommendation of said
                            bill to the House.
                         Whereupon, it was introduced by said committee, viz: A bill [H. R.] for
                            an act to amend the 83[rd?] and 84th sections of the act relative to incorporated cities, &c.,
                            approved March 9, 1857. Which was read and passed to the second reading.
                        
                    


                    
                         REBEL RAIDS-RELIEF.
                        The SPEAKER announced the consideration of unfinished business, viz: Mr.
                            Prather's bill [H. R. 13] for relief from losses on account of rebel
                            raids-and pending amendments to-wit; Mr. Shuey's, recited yesterday, and
                            providing also that, the expenses of said commission shall be paid cut
                            of the several sums allowed to such claimants, pro
                                rata. Together with Mr. Brown's amendment, adding to the first
                            paragraph these words: ''Such Commission shall diligently inquire if
                            such claimants were members of the Loyal League, or other treasonable
                            associations;" and Mr. Dunham's amendment to the bill, inserting after
                            the word "Journal," the words "Indianapolis Sentinel."

                        Mr. SHUEY, being entitled to the floor, said the subject coming up
                            unexpectedly, he would move to postpone the bill and amendments, and
                            make them the special order for to-morrow at 10 o'clock A. M.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    

                    
                        CHARLES B. LASSELLE
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted the following:

                        
                            
                                

                                     WHEREAS, From the evidence adduced before the Military
                                        Commission held in the city of Indianapolis, commencing on
                                        the 25th day of October, 1864. in the case of the United
                                        States vs. Wm. A. Bowles and others, on a charge of
                                        conspiracy against the Government of the United States, and
                                        for the assassination of the Governor of the State of
                                        Indiana, it appears that Charles B. Lasselle, of Cass
                                        county, and now a member of this House, belonged to and was
                                        a member of the Supreme Council of a secret order known as
                                        the Knights of the Golden Circle," or "Sons of Liberty," and
                                        that he had voluntarily taken the oath prescribed for the
                                        several degrees of that order, and, as appears from the
                                        evidence taken in said commission, the members of the said
                                        Suprame Council were concerned in the treason and crimes
                                        charged against said defendants, therefore,
                                    Resolved, That a committee of five be
                                        appointed to Investigate the fact whether or not the said
                                        Charles Lasselle was a member of said treasonable order, and
                                        report to the House by resolution or otherwise whether or
                                        not it is consistent with the dignity and respect of this
                                        House for said Charles B. Lasselle to occupy a seat as a
                                        member of this House, and that said committee shall have
                                        full power to send for all necessary persons and papers.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. MILLER had introduced this for the purpose of getting this question
                            into form. He was not acquainted with the gentleman charged here, but as
                            he was told he was very much of gentleman, he hoped he might be able to
                            defend himself successfully. He had put it in this form so that,
                            gentlemen assuming to defend this secret order might not be able to
                            plead that they do not understand the ground we occupy; and that they
                            may defend it as a part of their party organization, if they desire to
                            do so. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH would not discuss the resolution at this time, thinking it
                            would be better to defer its consideration till some future time. He
                            moved to make it the special order for Wednesday of next week, at 10
                            o'clock.
                         Mr. LASSELLE said he would neither oppose nor court this investigation.
                            He might object to some of the terms the resolution, for he professed
                            subjection to the Constitution and laws of his county. So far as the
                            charge involved his reputation as a law-abiding man, he not only
                            challenged, but courted investigation.
                        Mr. PRATHER had no particular objection to the motion. If, however, it
                            were true that a gentleman occupying a seat on. this floor belongs to
                            this order, or has belonged to it, it was due to the House and the
                            country, that investigation be had immediately. So far as he was
                            concerned, he would not consent to sit in this hall with a member of
                            that order. Any member charged with belonging, and knowing it to be
                            true, ought to withdraw. It wartime that we should purge ourselves from
                            this order, not only in the House of Representatives, but in the State
                            at large. He had seen this kind of guerrillaing heretofore, and he
                            advised a bold charge upon those men, and whenever that charge should be
                            made, they would skedaddle. He would offer them a bold front, and no
                            fear of sand-boxes or other missiles.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The question was on the motion to make the resolution a
                            special order. Therefore, debate not being in order, he should not
                            answer the gentleman from Jennings, [Mr. Prather]. The subject of
                            politics had not yet been broached by the Democratic side. But they did
                            not shrink from the contest if the opposite side would provoke it.
                        Mr. PRATHER. Did not the gentleman from Jackson, (Mr. Brown.) declare
                            here, that he was ready to go into it, with sleeves rolled up?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. That was only in debate.
                        Mr. CHURCH. Did the gentleman consider an inquiry relative to the Knights
                            of the Golden Circle a political question?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It has been made such. The gentleman from Jennings had said
                            it was unpleasant for him to occupy a seat on this floor with a member
                            of the order of the Sons of Liberty; to this he could answer that it was
                            unpleasant to him to sit in council with a-member of the Loyal League.
                            Thank God! his instincts on that subject had always been right. He had
                            never belonged to any secret organization never in his life.
                        Mr. CHURCH begged to know if the gentleman desired to defend the Knights
                            or the Sons of Liberty as a political organization ?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It was forcing a discussion he did not desire to enter into,
                            He could never desire to defend any man or set of men guilty of any
                            treasonable act, guilty of conspiracy against the Government of the
                            United States or the State of Indiana. But when the time should come he
                            did not propose to contrast the secret political organizations of the
                            Republican and Democratic parties. Even Gov. Morton in his message had
                            admitted that he was satisfied that a large portion of those belonging
                            to the Sons of Liberty were wholly ignorant of the purposes of that
                            organization. By Wednesday we could be prepared to make this discussion
                            much shorter than it would be possible to make it now.
                        Mr. BRANHAM hoped it would, not be postponed. Discussion could result in
                            no possible good. The resolution of inquiry should go to a committee. If
                            the gentleman referred to in  it was
                            a member of that Order, he was unworthy to sit in this House.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB would have preferred that the resolution had not been
                            submitted. He thought the House had undertaken a pretty large contract
                            if it were attempting to oust from their seats all that belong to this
                            Order. He was not disposed to disturb any of them. If we are to have a
                            discussion, he also would be in favor of postponement. Bat since the
                            gentleman from Cass says he courts investigation, he could not see why
                            we should not have a committee to inquire into the facts. And why not
                            send the matter at once to the committee let them report it back, and
                            then debate?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The reason we desire discussion was: It is a question of
                            privilege. We deny the right of the House to go behind the elections by
                            the people to investigate the qualifications of members.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. He says he wants investigation.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. What else could he say?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. If he desires it, I will vote far it. He can speak for
                            himself.
                        Mr. LASSELLE said he was placed in a very delicate position. He hardly
                            knew what to say. Since the matter had been brought before the House, he
                            left it with the House. He had confidence in the House. And whilst he
                            would not invite charges, he was now ready to challenge investigation.
                            He did not feel like claiming any right-his friends and the whole House
                            he believed would respect his rights here.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said, if we discuss this matter now, there was nothing before
                            us but the general proposition as to the character of the organization.
                            He could not see the advantage of such discussion. He moved its
                            reference to the Committee on Rights and
                            Privileges.
                        Mr. MILLER, of LaPorte, did not think the resolution was in a proper
                            shape for discussion. He could not charge the gentleman from Cass with
                            belonging to the order. He did not know the fact. But the evidence
                            adduced before the Commission had gone abroad to the world. Before there
                            was any discussion, there should be an examination and report by a
                            committee. And the gentleman could go before the committee and make his
                            defense-make pleadings-establish his loyalty to the Constitution and
                            consistent support of the Government of the United States. If the
                            committee exculpate him, we could withhold all discussion. But if the
                            facts as alleged in the testimony before the committee were true, the
                            House and the country out to know it. The principal question with him
                            was: Are gentlemen on the other side ready to defend that order? The
                            gentleman from Monroe had said that the Governor admits that many went
                            into that order without knowledge of its treasonable purposes. He
                            admitted that himself. But if the gentleman from Cass belonged to the
                            Military Division and the Supreme Council, and if their treasonable
                            '"objects and designs were promulgated there, he,must have been
                            cognizant of them, and he ought to purge himself of them. It seemed to
                            him that no view could be taken that would not warrant the appointment
                            of this committee. If the gentleman was not guilty, he intended him no
                            wrong. He could not see how gentlemen could object. At the proper time,
                            he believed it would appear that this organization had gone much farther
                            in treason than anything that had yet been made public-to the extent of
                            signals by which our officers in command could signify a disposition to
                            surrender to the enemy. He asked that the resolution be referred to a
                            committee.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH had an abhorrent opinion of the order of the Sons of
                            Liberty. Whilst he may have mistaken his mission here, he said he had
                            supposed we came here to legislate for the people of the State. But from
                            big observations of the past two days, it seemed that was not the
                            purpose. It seemed that the purpose was to legislate for our parties. He
                            was for his country first and party afterwards. However, he was in favor
                            of the reference. He desired first to get through with the subjects of
                            legislation pressing upon us. George Washington told us to avoid party
                            spirit. But I think he would be considered an old dolard in these days,
                            by gentlemen here, and kicked out of any caucuses by either party,
                            Thomas Jefferson had said, that truth had nothing to fear from, error so
                            long as reason was left free to combat it. Gentlemen here seemed to be
                            ready for fight on both sides; but he could see neither philosophy nor
                            Christianity in such a course. It might be all right if this were a
                            political cabal, and we all on the stump; but if we are here to
                            legislate for the benefit of the State, let us lay aside these
                            firebrands till we get through with more important matters. Since he
                            came into this hall he had felt sometimes as though there was no
                            providence over the affairs of men, but that agitation is the proper
                            element of life. I do not propose to humbly ask of our Democratic
                            friends as to what we may and what we may not do, but without reference
                            to the opinions of gentlemen upon that or our own side of the House, I
                            propose in determining my own course to first ask myself: Is it right?
                            and if so, pursue it, responsible only to God my country and
                            society.
                        Mr. RICE demanded the previous question, but withdrew it for-
                        Mr. COFFROTH, who suggested conclusion to the effect that this was not a
                            question of sufficient importance to go to a committee. When he had
                            concluded-
                        Mr. RICE renewed the demand for the previous question, and there was a
                            second, and the main question was ordered
                        The SPEAKER held that rule 35 cuts off motions and amendments, and that
                            the main question was on the adoption of the original proposition.
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon, resulted,
                            yeas 55, nays 34, as follows:

                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        Mr. HOWARD introduced a bill, [H. R 53,] for an act to amend section 14
                            of the act to provide for a uniform mode of doing township business
                            &c., approved February 18, 1859.
                        Mr. COOK introduced a bill, [H. R. 54] for an act to amend section 82 of
                            the Common School act of March 11, 1861, so as to authorize County
                            Auditors to make loans of the Common School revenue in sums not
                            exceeding $1,000, and declaring when this act shall take effect.
                        Mr. WOODS introduced a bill, [H. R. 55,] feign act authorizing a canal
                            from the Calumet river to Lake Michigan, for the purpose of draining a
                            portion of the swamp lands of Lake and Porter counties.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, introduced a bill [H. R. 56] for an act to repeal
                            the act to ascertain the amount of the fees and salaries of the Clerks

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Elections be instructed to inquire into the

                                        depriving from the right of suffrage, those persons who have
                                        or may flee to Canada, or any other foreign, country, to
                                        evade the draft, and thus release themselves from the

                                        their own country.

                                     Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Elections be requested to inquire into the
                                        expediency of so amending the election laws of the State of
                                        Indiana, as to require a registration of at least forty days
                                        before voting, of all the voters of each and every township,
                                        to be kept by the Township Trustee, and that said Township
                                        Trustee shall provide for such registration, and give due
                                        notice thereof, by advertising in the newspaper of most
                                        general circulation in such township.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    


                    
                        PARTY QUESTIONS.
                        Mr. FOULKE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That no question of a partisan
                                        character shall be introduced in this House, until the
                                        needful legislation, so essential to the prosperity of this
                                        State, shall have been performed.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB suggested the difficulty in determining what matter involved
                            party questions. Most anything could be perverted. He moved to refer the
                            resolution to the Committee on Rights and
                            Privileges.
                        Mr. BURTCN proposed to amend, by way of substitute, as follows:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, All political issues which
                                        heretofore divided us have been in a manner decided at the
                                        ballot-box, and there is now but one vital issue before the
                                        people, namely, the issue of greenbacks;
                                    and,Whereas, This great issue has apparently enhanced our
                                        national prosperity by elevating the two most cherished
                                        commodities of the country, namely, gold and negroes;
                                        and,
                                    Whereas, Our individual prosperity and our national safety
                                        necessarily depend in a great degree, if not entirely, upon
                                        the greenback; issue; therefore,
                                    Resolved, That, in order to harmonize all
                                        confliting elements upon this floor, we forget, for the
                                        present, all past political differences, unite heart and
                                        hand upon this heavy issue, and cause it, if possible, to
                                        redound to the honor and glory of our common country.
                                    Resolved, Further, that to this end, it
                                        behooves the dear people in this emergency, to look well to
                                        their pockets, and to this end, while they place their
                                        hearts "upon things above," namely, gold and negroes, they
                                        should not forget to place their hands upon the things
                                        below, namely, greenbacks.

                                    Resolved, Finally, that this is the only
                                        policy we can pursue, if we would compensate ourselves for
                                        the losses sustained, because of the many battles fought and
                                        victories lost and won in the "irrepressible conflict"
                                        between "truth and error," which, though it has "covered our
                                        waters and darkened our land" with blood and mourning, has
                                        nevertheless, produced a never-ending issue, that will
                                        remain ever green in memory, till Abraham shall declare that
                                        war and greenback's shall be no more.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution and proposed amendment were referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                    
                    

                    
                         RULE 55.
                        Mr. BRANHAM now called up the consideration of his proposition to amend
                            the 55th rule of the House, as recited yesterday.
                        The amendment was concurred in as a part of the Rules of the House of
                            Representatives. 
                    
                    
                        STATUES FOR MEMBERS.
                        Mr. SPENCER submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That the State Librarian be and
                                        is hereby requested to supply each member of the House, who
                                        has not yet been furnished, with the second volume of the
                                        Revised Statutes, (Gavin & Hord,) at his earliest
                                        convenience, in accordance with previous instructions from
                                        this House to that effect, and that the Clerk be instructed
                                        to inform him immediately of the adoption of this
                                        resolution.
                                
                            
                        

                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to amend, by inserting these words: "Who have not yet
                            been furnished."Which was agreed to.
                         The resolution was adopted.
                    


                    
                        AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK gave notice of an amendment of the rules, which he would
                            propose to-morrow, It was suggested by the holding of the Speaker under
                            the 35th rule, that the previous question cuts off motions and
                            amendments. He should propose to supply words which had been left out by
                            the printer. His amendment would be to insert in said Rule 35, after the
                            word "upon," in the fifth line, these words: "a motion to commit, if
                            such motion shall have been made; and if this motion does not prevail,
                            then"--

                            resolution requesting our Representatives and instructing our Senators
                            in Congress to use their influence to the end that a bonded tobacco
                            warehouse may be authorized at Evansville.
                        He said there was no other tobacco mart in the State except the city of
                            Evansville, which comes next to Louisville in importance; and that there
                            should be two bonded warehouses in Kentucky, and none in Indiana, is not
                            exactly fair.
                        The petition lies on the table.

                            report when the Clerk of the House may deliver messages, (prefaced by
                            several picksniffian preambles.) coming up-
                        Mr. BENNETT moved to amend as follows:

                                        the last night of the session, when nonsense will be in
                                        order.
                                
                            
                        

                        Several Senators expressing the belief that no such a string of preambles
                            was ever passed by the House-
                        Mr. BENNETT withdrew the amendment, and, on his motion, it was-

                        
                            
                                
                                    Ordered, That the preamble and resolution
                                        be returned to the House, with an inquiry whether they
                                        really were adopted by that body.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        ANOTHER HOUSE RESOLUTION.
                        A preamble and resolution from the House of Representatives, urging
                            committees to greater diligence, coming up-
                        Mr. BENNETT moved to amend by adding: "That each branch of the General
                            Assembly be allowed to regulate their own domestic in sitatutions in
                            their own way."

                            on the table.

                        FRIDAY, January 20, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER called to order at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed the roll call,
                        which discovered a quorum present.

                        a memorial to the Congress of the United States.
                    The SPEAKER [Mr. Wiggins in the Chair] laid before the House a communication
                        from the Governor announcing that he had authorized B. R. Sulgrove to make
                        Executive Communications to the General Assembly during the present
                        session.

                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            reported back Mr. Shoaff, of Allen's, Dog bill [No. 8] recommending its
                            passage.
                        On motion of Mr. HARRISON, the report was concurred in.
                        Mr. BROWN, from the same committee, returned the resolution of the House
                            of Representatives relative to the printing of the Governor's Message,
                            recommending the printing of 11,500 copies-8,000 in English and the
                            remainder in German-10,000 for the Governor, and 3,500 for the use of
                            the House of Representatives.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the report was concurred in.
                        Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,
                            reported back to the House Mr. Miller, of Tippicanoe's bill [No. 2,]
                            increasing the compensation of the Judges of the Supreme Court, with an
                            amendment of the third section, inserting "$2,500" instead, of
                            "$3,000".
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, proposed to amend by re-inserting the
                            $3,000."
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the bill, report and amendment were reported to
                            the Committee on the Judiciary.
                    



                    
                        AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
                        Mr. BRANHAM gave notice of his intention to-morrow to propose an
                            amendment to the 54th Rule-to strike out "twelve," and insert "ten and a
                            half o'clock" as the time when the order of business for the day shall
                            end.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.

                            amend the 406th section of the general practice act of June 18,

                            section or the county surveyors' act, approved June 17, 1862.
                         Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, introduced a bill, [H. R. 67,] for an act to
                            entitle attorneys to hold liens on judgments.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, introduced a bill, [H. R. 68,] for an act to
                            authorize the Boards of County Commissioners to make donations and
                            receive subscriptions for the purpose of erecting monuments to the
                            memory of those from their several counties who have lost their lives or
                            may lose their lives in the present war.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS introduced a bill [H. R. 69] for an act to amend section 1,
                            10, 11 and 20 of the Supervisor's Act, approved March 5, 1859.
                    

                    
                         COLLECTON LAW.
                        Mr. WOODS submitted a resolution to the effect that the
                                Committee on County and Township Business, be
                            instructed to consider the propriety of amending the collection law so
                            as to employ township collectors, instead of the present manner of
                            collection.
                        It was rejected. 
                    

                    
                        COMMON PLEAS.
                        Mr. COFFROTH introduced the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Organization of Courts be instructed to
                                        inquire into the expediency of abolishing the Courts of
                                        Common Pleas, and report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                        Mr. BROWN obtained leave of absence for Mr. Dunham-attending court.
                    
                    
                        REBEL RAIDS-RELIEF.
                        The SPEAKER announced the consideration of the special order, viz: Mr.
                            Prather's bill [H. R. 13.] with the pending amendments.
                        The question being on Mr. Brown's amendment, recited yesterday-
                        Mr. SHUEY said he was not at all combative in his temper, as intimated by
                            the gentleman from Floyd, (Mr. Dunham.) He did not wish to bring himself
                            into conflict with any. He especially desired not to get into a
                            political discussion, unacquainted as he was with parliamentary
                            usages.
                        
                        The pending bill authorized a commission to examine claims for property
                            lost by the John Moran raid. I intended to offer simply suggestions to
                            the committee to which it was referred. I had carefully examined the
                            character of these secret organizations, and had come to the conclusion
                            that they were treasonable per se that no man could approach their
                            vestibules Without knowing their disloyal intentions. This being my
                            opinion, I was unwilling to allow the proposed relief to men of this
                            State whose influence through these organizations brought John Morgan
                            and his band into this state. I had carefully examined the report of
                            Gen. Barrington, and then, reading the statements of such men as Bingham
                            and Heffren, I found that they fully sustained the statements of General
                            Carrington. Hence, I have a right to say that every individual who went
                            into that organization, knew at the time that it was disloyal, and that
                            they went into it for disloyal purposes. I found from Gen. Garrington's
                            report, that upon several occasions these men had been watching the
                            approach of the raiders; that their secret organizations feed knowledge
                            when John Morgan was to arrive at the Ohio river; and that when he was
                            about to approach word went out to him to wait; and that when he did
                            come, it was at a time when they fully expected him. And I have it from
                            gentlemen on this floar, that during the raid they found billets of
                            paper on the path of the raiders, directing them where they could find
                            good Union men to prey upon.
                        Mr. BROWN [interposing.] I desire the gentleman to name these men.
                        Mr. SHUEY. That is not my purpose now; but if the gentleman will come to
                            me privately, I will name them.
                        Mr. BROWN. Will the gentleman yield the floor?
                        Mr. SHUEY. Not for that purpose. I am giving these considerations, Mr.
                            Speaker, as reasons which actuated me in offering this amendment.
                        Now, if I am mistaken-if there are members of this order, merely of the
                            vestibule or political organization, who are loyal-it may be proper for
                            the committee to modify my amendment so as to exclude such from its
                            operation. The distinguished gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Dunham] says
                            there is a political part of the organization in which there is nothing
                            treasonable.
                        Let us inquire just a moment into that. This order wes organized and
                            established within the borders of this State at a time when the Nation
                            was struggling for its existence; when it was the special duty of every
                            good citizen, every patriot, to support and maintain the constitution
                            and laws of the land; at a time when every man should have kept himself
                            in readiness to enforce the laws both of the State and Nation. And I say
                            that any man who, in a time like this, will raise his hand and swear
                            that he will obey without question the Supreme Commander of a secret
                            order, when there is a supreme commander of the armies of the United
                            States, authorized by the constitution, must be a disloyal man. I
                            understand that it is my duty to hold myself in readiness for the call
                            of the President of the United States and of the Governor of the State
                            of Indiana, and I say it is treason for any man to get up and swear that
                            he will obey the Supreme Commander of the Sons of Liberty. I hold in my
                            hand the form of that oath, which I will read:
                        "I do further swear, that I will, at all times and in all places, yield
                            prompt and implicit obedience, to the utmost of my ability, without
                            remonstrance, hesitation or delay, to any and every mandate, order or
                            request of my immediate M. E. G. C in all things touching the purposes
                            of the O. S. L., and to defend the principles thereof, when assailed in
                            my own State or county, in whatever capacity may be assigned to me by
                            authority of our order," &c.
                        This pamphlet from which I read was taken from the safe of the Most
                            Excellent Commander, therefore it is not an Abolition or Republican
                            lie.
                        Now, sir, is it true that, in time of war, when the institutions of our
                            country are jeopardized, is it true that, as men of Indiana we do not
                            owe our chief allegiance to the authorized commanders of the armies of
                            the State and Nation? If not, then for a man to voluntarily to take this
                            obligation, is treason.
                        I have further proof, Mr. Speaker, that there were traitors in Indiana,
                            and in my simplicity, I had come to the conclusion that there are really
                            no traitors in the State except those belonging to the secret political
                            order of the American Knights, or Sons of Liberty. I will ask the Clerk
                            to read the following letter from Col. Cyrus L. Dunham to the
                            Governor:

                                        GOVERNOR:
                                    
                                     This will be handed to you by Major Atkisson, of the
                                        glorious old 50th, who comes home to gather up out
                                        deserters; I hope he will have all the aid and influence you
                                        can give him. Vigorous measures must be adopted, or our
                                        army, under the influence of the scoundrels and traitor at
                                        home, who are, by their letters, scattering discontent
                                        amongst our soldiers, will be demoralized and destroyed, and
                                        the scourge of this war will, in less than six months, be
                                        rolled back upon the fair fields of our own glorious
                                        Northwest. These men know not what they do. and if they
                                        expect any general sympathy in the army they are reckoning
                                        without their host.
                                     I hope you will use your influence at Washington to get a
                                        law passed requiring all the United States Marshals and
                                        their deputies, all collectors of internal revenue and their
                                        deputies, to arrest all deserters and lodge them at the
                                        nearest military post, making it also a penal offense,
                                        indictable in the District Court of the United States, for
                                        one to harbor or employ a deserter, knowing him to be such,
                                        and the knowledge that the individual had been in the
                                        service of the United States should be prima
                                            facie evidence of knowledge that he was a deserter,
                                        making all contracts with a deserter void. Do not, for God's
                                        sake, let this army be so weakened that we shall be driven
                                        back in humiliation to witness the desolation of our own
                                        homes.
                                    
                                         Respectfully yours.
                                        C. L. DUNHAM.
                                    

                                
                            
                        


                        Mr. Speaker, we were informed here the other day, by the distinguished
                            gentleman  from Floyd, that this
                            organization sprung into existence by reason of the arbitrary and
                            oppressive acts of the National Government; and in consequence the
                            people had to flee for protection into secret organizations. But now, at
                            the time of writing of this letter-February, 1863-nearly two years ago,
                            this distinguished and patriotic Colonel in the army, notifies the
                            Governor at home, that these scoundrels and traitors at home are writing
                            letters to the soldiers, and scattering discontent amongst them, and
                            causing desertion and making it probable that the tide of this war would
                            be rolled back upon our glorious Northwest by such raids as in that of
                            John Morgan, and advising the Governor to adopt vigorous measures
                            against them. Now, I confess I had the weakness to believe this
                            statement by the Colonel Commanding the 50th Regiment. But because,
                            forsooth, the Governor thought proper to carry out his
                            recommendation-for that very reason-as a politician, not as a Colonel-he
                            comes here and tells us and the people of Indiana, that all these acts
                            which he recommended should be taken by the Governor, were arbitrary and
                            unjust, and that the people were in some sense justifiable in seeking
                            protection in secret and treasonable lodges, to get out of the way of
                            his own advice to the Governor.
                        Sir, what does it mean to adopt vigorous measures to arrest the influence
                            of these scoundrels and traitors? The Governor looked about and
                            discovered these men in secret conclave, plotting treason and
                            establishing military organizations for the express purpose of resisting
                            the constituted authorities of the State. And I commend him for his
                            sagacity in sending men to go and work themselves into the confidence of
                            these traitors, and get themselves inside of their secret conclaves--all
                            the time acting under the advice of the distinguished Colonel of the
                            50th Regiment. And now in this discussion complaint is made because the
                            Governor thought proper to call on such men as General Carrington and
                            Mr. Stidger, to make examination into those conclaves. Complaint in made
                            because he employs agents to inveigle men into these organizations! If
                            Mr. Stidger, with the knowledge of the Governor and General Carrington,
                            did inveigle men into this organization, let us refer again to the
                            advice of the Colonel's letter. I say, if the Governor did employ
                            vigorous measures to expose and suppress this order, he anted under the
                            advice of the gentleman from Floyd. He is fully justified by the advice
                            of this letter. And if Mr. Stidger can be fairly charged with getting
                            men into this order for political effect, then I might charge the same
                            thing against Gen. McClellan for sending men to Richmond to get within
                            the rebel lines for the information of the service of the United States.
                            McClellan acted upon the same principle which enabled Mr. Stidger to get
                            into the inner oath of the Sons of Liberty.
                         But there is urged another reason why the Sons of Liberty are at heart
                            excusable, if not justifiable. It is said that these men had to go into
                            this organization to protect themselves from the Loyal Leaguers. If this
                            is true, it does not seem that they understood very well what loyalty
                            is. If it is true, as stated by the gentleman from Floyd, that it was
                            the darkened curtains of the Loyal League that drove them into this
                            organization, they must be understood their organization very well; for
                            since the time of their organization, they have never raised a finger
                            against the Loyal Leaguers, because they knew they would strike them the
                            hardest blows when they struck at the heart of the Government, I
                            undertake to say that there is not a particle of proof the Sons of
                            Liberty ever raised their against the Loyal Leaguers, but as they gave
                            and comfort to the enemies of the Government.
                         But here is an important fact that ought to be taken into consideration.
                            It is well known that two years ago, there was not a lodge of Loyal
                            Leaguers in the State. They were hardly in existence at the time the
                            Colonel of the 50th Regiment advised vigorous measures against the
                            influence of the traitors and scoundrels in these secret
                            organizations.
                        Sir, I once took upon myself the obligation of the Loyal League, and I am
                            free to say, that the man that would refuse to take upon himself that
                            obligation on account of the matter contained in it, is a traitor. It
                            was the same obligation that was taken here by members in the
                            organization of this House.
                        I am told on this floor, by men for whom I have a very profound respect,
                            that it is exceedingly unpleasant to them to sit in this Hall with
                            members of the Loyal League. I will ask such gentlemen what evidence
                            they have that there was ever a disloyal sentiment uttered in a lodge of
                            the Leaguers ? Did they ever arm, or pretend to arm themselves for any
                            purpose whatever? I deny it. But I say here, that they are organized for
                            this single purpose, to be in readiness to obey the first call for
                            service by the State or National Government.
                        Mr. BROWN. Is it not a part of the creed, that they shall not vote for
                            any but a certain class ?
                        Mr. SHUEY. No sir. I will say this much: that it is a universal
                            understanding among Loyal Leaguers, that they will not vote for
                            traitors-and they regard as traitors those giving aid and comfort to the
                            enemy.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. I will ask the gentlemen if they regard all Democrats as
                            traitors ?
                         Mr. SHUEY. Not by any means. 
                        Mr. BROWN. I understand these leagues are organized to be ready for
                            military service. I will ask whether any of them entered the service at
                            the time John Morgan invaded the State?
                        Mr. SHUEY. I can only answer for my immediate neighborhood. I wrote to
                            the Governor that myself and fifty others were ready to come forward.
                            But we were informed that we were too late. But I am informed that in
                            the central and southern portions of the State, they turned out almost
                            en masse.
                        But I want to call attention to another fact. It is well remembered that
                            during the invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania, the Loyal Leaguers of
                            Baltimore rushed forward, and by their promptness and patriotic devotion
                            to their country saved the city of Baltimore from the flames by the
                            torch of Early and his thieves.
                        Mr. Speaker, I would say to gentlemen candidly that, in my judgment, the
                            money of the loyal people of this State ought not to be given to disloyal men. I am willing, in the
                            language of the gentleman from Floyd, to let bygones be bygones; and so
                            far as party animosities are concerned, I have preached the same thing
                            ever since the rebellion began. But in times like these, when the
                            national life is imperilled, when I see men organized for the purpose of
                            giving aid and comfort to the enemy when I see men elected to office and
                            figuring in our armies, talking about State sovereignty men in the
                            vestibules of the Sons of Liberty affirming that the National Government
                            has no right to coerce a State, giving all the weight o their influence
                            to aid and comfort my enemies and your enemies, and the enemies of
                            mankind when I see such men in communication with "their Southern
                            brethren," and inviting their bloody raids to roll in upon our homes; I
                            say it is due to common justice that we should protect ourselves, and
                            especially that we should afford them no assistance whatever. 
                        I might say, sir, that I am in favor of this bill in itself; but I do
                            think that the Commission it creates ought to be compelled to inquire
                            into the loyalty of the men presenting claims For these reasons, sir, I
                            submitted my amendment, without consulting any member on the floor.
                        Mr. HOWARD [interrupting.] Does the gentleman propose to exempt those
                            claimant from taxation ?
                        Mr. SHUEY. Not by any means. I say Mr. Speaker, that those identical
                            persons are the traitors and scoundrels of the gentleman from Floyd, who
                            have brought the raiders upon us to raise our taxes to relieve the
                            suffering they have caused. And for that reason, if I had the power, I
                            would bring to bear upon them i little special legislation. I would
                            confiscate every dollar of their property. I will say here that any man
                            who knowingly and intentionally gives aid and comfort to the enemy, in
                            time like these, should be held as having no right which loyal men are
                            bound to respect.
                        Mr. HOWARD. What does the gentleman think of those members of the order
                            that helped to capture John Morgan ?
                        Mr. SHUEY. Why, sir, of them I would say "Let a repenting rebel live."
                            [Laughter.]
                        I will say now, in conclusion, that I did no intend to thrust this into
                            the House as a political question; but the gentleman from Floyd has told
                            me, that when in my amendment used the words, ''Knights of the Golden
                            Circle," "American Knights," "Sons of Liberty," and "other secret
                            disloyal organizations." I hit Democrats right in the eye. I certainly
                            did not think so, for I know there are Democrats that do not deserve to
                            be classed with these orders. I know these organizations are
                            treasonable, and ought to be so regarded. When we speak of these
                            organizations we do not speak of the Democratic party.
                        Mr. BUSSIRK said it might be well for us to look at the question. The
                            gentleman from Jenning introduced this bill for the relief of citizens
                            of the State from rebel raids. The gentleman from Elkhart had submitted
                            an amendment, directing the Committee to inquire into the loyalty of
                            claimants. The question was on the adoption of the amendment. He had
                            answered a gentleman yesterday, that it was unpleasant for me to sit
                            here with a member of the Loyal League. His objection to such was, that
                            their proceedings were secret, and they were oath bound. He said to the
                            gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange, [Mr. Shuey,] that when the people
                            of the Northern counties had sacrificed and served for the State and the
                            United States as the people of the Southern counties, then their
                            assertions on account of recent organizations might come with a better
                            grace. For 20 or 30 miles north of the Ohio river, they had almost
                            constantly slept on their arms, whilst, by his own aspersion, the people
                            of the northern counties and the gentleman from Elkhart were too late
                            when they tendered their services.
                        Mr. SHUEY disclaimed saying any thing that could be construed into an
                            aspersion of the people of the Southern portion of the State.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It was in the amendment the gentleman offered. A very large
                            number will present claims that belonged to the Sons of Liberty. Members
                            of the order of the Sons of Liberty were the first and swiftest pursuers
                            of John Morgan.
                        Mr. SHUEY. Were they known and conspicuous members of the order.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Yes sir. Eren Horace-Heffren, whom he did not desire to
                            defend here or elsewhere, went after Morgan; the gentleman from Floyd
                            followed him into the State of Ohio. His objection to the amendment was
                            the assumption that it was disloyal and treasonable to belong to the
                            Sons of Liberty. If membership there were disloyal and treasonable, so
                            was membership in the Loyal League. In his judgment there was no
                            difference. If any claimant under the bill had invited the raid, or
                            aided the raiders, such should not be relieved. But he could not see the
                            purpose to proscribe one third of the territory of the State, and almost
                            one half of the voters of the State, without making opposition here. The
                            Governor had recommended the appointment of the proposed commission. Yet
                            the Governor, with all his partisan feelings, was not so prescriptive
                            ana narrow-minded as to proscribe any class of claimants. The Governor
                            displayed some libarality in his public estimate of the Sons of Liberty,
                            which was well received by Democrats here. He trusted that the amendment
                            of the gentleman from Elkhart would find but few supporters, and that
                            the bill will be passed.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, proposed an amendment to the effect, that said
                            Commission should not allow any claim presented by any person belonging
                            to any disloyal organization, or who had invited the John Morgan raid,
                            or counseled resistance to the draft or encouraged desertion, and he
                            demanded the previous question.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH desired to offer an amendment.
                        Mr. RIFORD asked the gentleman from Tippecanoe to withdraw his demand for
                            the previous question, that he might propose an amendment by way of
                            substitute;
                        Mr. BROWN rose to a question of order. There were two amendments to the
                            bill already pending-that of Mr. Shuey and one offered by  himself. Mr. Dunham's amendment was
                            withdrawn.
                        The SPEAKER sustained the point.
                        Mr. BUSKlRK moved to lay the amendments of Mr. Shuey and Mr. Brown on the
                            table.
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Tippecanoe, (Mr. Miller,) has demanded
                            the previous question.
                        Mr. MILLER withdrew the demand.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK made again his motion to lie on the table.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB demanded a division of the question.

                        
                        The first question being on the motion to table Mr. Brown's amendment, it
                            was decided in the affirmative-yes 87, nays 1.
                        The next question being the motion to lay Mr. Shuey's amendment on the
                            table; and the yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                            the result was-yeas 43, nays 45-as follows:

                                        Stringer, Trusler, Upson, Welch, Whiteaide, Willis,
                                        Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zeigler and Mr. Speaker-45.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. FERRIS said he voted to lay the amendment on the table, because he
                            believed in his heart that there were hundreds of thousands of loyal
                            Democrats who may have been drawn into this organization without knowing
                            their principles.
                        Mr. GROVES, when his name was called, said: When I vote for this
                            amendment, I do not vote against a Democrat receiving remuneration for
                            his losses.
                        So the House refused to lay the amendment on the table. 
                        The next question being on the adoption of Mr. Shuey's amendment.
                        Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the amendment by adding:
                        
                            
                                



                                    Provided, That no claim shall be allowed to
                                        be allowed to any person who may have been convicted of
                                        crime of having belonged to any treasonable association, or
                                        of having given aid and comfort to the public enemy, before
                                        any court of competent jurisdiction.

                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BROWN moved to refer the bill and pending amendments to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        [A message in writing was now received from the Governor, by the hand of
                            B. R. Sulgrove.]
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill and
                            amendments till Tuesday, 10 o'clock, at which time he gave notice that
                            he would move for an afternoon session.
                        Mr. BROWN. There was always a time every session of the General Assembly
                            when gentlemen would deliver themselves on political questions.
                         Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, hoped the subject would be disposed of at
                            once.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved to make it a special order for Tuesday
                            week.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. Newcomb's motion was then adopted
                        So the bill and amendments were made a special order for next Tuesday 10
                            o'clock.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the regular order of business was suspended,
                            and the House took up the orders of the day.
                        Mr. Spencer's bill [H. R. 15 ] to
                            authorize the removal of fences and buildings on highways destroyed by
                            floods, coming up-
                         On motion by Mr. PRATHER, it was referred to the Committee on

                         WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        A message from the Senate announced the passage in that body of a bill,
                                [S. 49] to refund money to
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co., advanced by them at the request of the
                            Governor, to pay interest on the State debt.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the orders of the day were suspended, and it
                            was read the first time and passed to the second reading.

                        COUNTY WAR BONDS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB obtained unanimous consent, on behalf of the

                         On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, (the constitutional restriction being
                            suspended for the purpose-yeas 72, nays 2,) the resolution was passed

                        A motion by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe county, the orders of the day were
                            suspended  for the consideration of
                            the Governor's message just announced. The message transmits a letter
                            from Robert Stockwell and others, proposing to donate to the State the
                            college building of the Stockwell Collegiate Institute and grounds (160
                            acres) for the purpose of the proposed Agricultural College and
                            farm.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, said if members of the General Assembly
                            desired to visit these buildings and grounds, he was authorized to state
                            that there would be tendered to them a free ride on the railroad to
                            Stockwell and back.
                        On motion by Mr. OLEMAN, the message and paper was referred to the
                                Committee on Education.Messrs- Sullivan of Scott,
                            Lasselle, Puett, Ferris and James obtained leave of absence till next
                            week.
                        And then at 12 1/2 o'clock P. M- 
                        On motion by Mr. BURNES, the House adjourned till to-morrow morning nine

                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        SATURDAY, January 21, 1865,
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and ordered the roll call,
                        which proceeded, and discovered a quorum present.
                    The journal of yesterday was read and authenticated.
                    A message from the Senate announced the passage there of a concurrent
                        resolution for a flag on the dome of the Capitol.

                    
                         ROADS.
                        Mr. SABIN presented a memorial from sundry citizens of Steuben county,
                            asking for $1 50 a day for labor on the highways; which was referred to
                            the Committee on Roads.
                    
                    
                        SUBSTITUTE BROKERAGE.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary
                            returned the resolution referred to them with reference to the
                            Indianapolis substitute brokerage ordinance, with a recommendation that
                            it be referred to the Select Committee on that
                            subject.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        SAMUEL H. PATTERSON.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, to which was
                            referred the petition of Samuel H. Patterson, reported that the
                            committee were satisfied that the State was indebted to the said
                            Patterson in the sum of $2,091 34; and he also reported a bill to pay
                            him.
                        The report was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                        A POINT OF ORDER.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. Mr. Speaker, should not the bill just reported be read? The
                            practice of the House has been that a bill reported by a committee be
                            read the first time when reported.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted that the bill should be read in the order for the
                            introduction of bills.
                        The SPEAKER. If a committee report a bill, it goes to the calendar, and
                            when we reach the calendar, it is read the first time, but of course the
                            Chair submits to the authority of the House.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. When will it be read?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. It was his impression that concurrence in the report of the
                            Committee, places the bill on the first reading.
                        After further debate on the order
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when a Committee makes a
                                        report on any matter referred to them, accompanied by a bill
                                        or resolution, the bill or resolution be read and acted on
                                        at the time of making the report.
                                
                            
                        
                        The SPEAKER entertained the resolution.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted, that the resolution was a proposition to change
                            the rules. It required one day's notice. An amendment of the rule on
                            Monday might correct the difficulty. He was ready himself to give notice
                            of his intention on Monday to move to amend the rules, to the effect,
                            That when a Committee report a bill or resolution, action should be
                            taken thereon at the time; and that when the Committee report an
                            amendment to a bill action shall be taken at the time on concurring in
                            the report.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, would rather adopt that course.
                        The SPEAKER. It might work better if the resolution of the gentleman from
                            Tippecanoe limited the action, of the House to the first reading of the
                            bill or resolution.
                        Mr. MILLER acquiesced and so modified his resolution.
                        Mr. BROWN. It cannot be done but by notice.
                        The SPEAKER considered the resolution not in the nature of a change of
                            rules, but simply the adoption of a resolution declaring the sense of
                            the House as to the meaning of a rule, which could be changed any day of
                            the session.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, withdrew his resolution for the purpose of
                            giving notice of amendment of the rules.
                    
                    
                        COMMON SCHOOLS.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, reported back the joint resolutions [H. R. 3
                            and 4], by Mr. Woods, to enable towns and districts to levy and collect
                            taxes for the support of Common Schools; and also to amend the State
                            Constitution on the same subject, with the expression of opinion, that
                            legislation on that subject at this time is inexpedient. The difficulty
                            sought to be removed can be remedied by increasing the taxes for the
                            support of Common Schools under the present Constitution. This committee
                            is now preparing a bill on that subject, of a uniform character, so that
                            common schools may be taught for from six to eight months of the year in
                            every town and district in the State.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    


                    
                        PER DIEM OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                         Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,to
                            which was referred Mr. Griffith's bill [H. R.4 ] to fix the per diem and
                            mileage of members of the General Assembly, and provide officers
                            therefor, reported the same again to the House, with an amendment
                            striking out the second and third sections thereof, alleging that
                            section 8, of article 4 of the State Constitution fully provides that
                            cash House shall choose its own elective officers.
                        
                        Mr. GRIFFETH asked that the 2d and 3d sections of the bill be read. He
                            desired also to know whether the report did not recommend the passage of
                            the bill as proposed to be amended ?
                        The report then went to the table, under the foregoing ruling of the
                            Chair.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH stated that at sometime he would have to appeal from the
                            ruling in this order.
                        The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman appeal from the decision of the
                            Chair?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. The pressure on the rules was too small now.
                    


                    
                        INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted an order by way of resolution to the effect, that
                            clerks of the Senate in delivering messages to the House of
                            Representatives be requested to wait till there is nothing before the
                            House before their messages are announced.
                        Mr. B. said he understood that the clerks of this House, charged with
                            messages to the Senate, were compelled to wait at the door of that body
                            till the pending business was disposed of He considered that order of
                            the Senate right and proper, But he had introduced this resolution now
                            more particularly because he had learned, that the concurrent resolution
                            on this subject submitted by Mr. Groves, and adopted by the House the
                            other day, when it came before the Senate, was treated with no respect
                            whatever-honorable Senators declaring that the Senate would attend to
                            its own business in its own way, and would submit to no dictation from
                            this House.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB supposed he could sympathize with the feeling of indignity
                            evinced by the gentleman from Jackson, if he had as much dignity as that
                            gentleman. Bat, as it was, though the lex taliones
                            might be a good principle, and answer well in practice in some cases, he
                            advised to drop the matter. Little good could come from agitating small
                            matters.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, suggested a committee to report the cost of this
                            frivolous legislation-catching mice.
                        Mr. CHURCH. Such an order might put an effectual stop to the intercourse
                            between the two Houses.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB showed that it could not be adhered to in the closing
                            business of the session.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair begs to say, with reference to the resolution of
                            the gentleman from Brown, that he has regarded this matter as amply
                            provided for by the Rules of the House; and in pursuance of the
                            authority of the Chair, he has informed the Doorkeeper, that no message
                            should be announced when business presses on the House. I think this is
                            the general ruling in such cases as to the order of intercourse between
                            legislative bodies. The Chair certainly could not recognize a messenger,
                            at a time when he could not recognize a member on the floor of the
                            House.
                        Mr. BROWN withdrew his resolution.
                        Mr. Branham's motion to amend rule 54, recited yesterday, was now taken
                            up and adopted.
                        Mr. RHOADS, from the Joint Committee on Enrolled
                            Bills, reported that said committee had presented to the
                            Governor Mr. Brown's enrolled act [H.
                                R. 3] for signature.
                    
                    
                        HON. HENRY WALKER.
                        Mr. GREGG submitted an order, which was adopted, tendering the use of the
                            Hall of Representatives to the Hon. Henry Walker, next Tuesday night,
                            for a public lecture on the condition of the country.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS. 
                        
                        Mr. BIRD introduced a bill [H.R. 71,] for an act for the relief of Ann
                            Vizard:
                        Mr. HENRICKS called up from the table the Finance
                                Committee's report, submitted this morning by Mr. Boyd,
                            and their bill [H. R. 72] for an act to reimburse Samuel H. Patterson,
                            lessee of the Jeffersonville prison, in the sum or $2,091 34, for money
                            paid by him for convict labor:
                        Mr. RICE introduced a bill [H. R. 73 ] for an act to amend sections 6,
                            10, 14, 20 of the Supervisor's act of March 5, 1859:
                        Mr. MILLER of Clinton, introduced a bill [H. R. 74] for an act relating
                            to the forms of conveyancing of real estate sold by Sheriffs,
                            prescribing certain duties of Clerks of Courts in relation thereto, and
                            providing compensation therefor:
                        Which bills were severally read and passed to a second reading.
                    
                    
                        WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the regular order of business was dispensed
                            with, and the House took up the consideration of the bill,[S. 49.] to authorize the State
                            Treasurer to refund Winslow, Lanier & Co. moneys paid by them by
                            request of the Governor, as interest on State bonds with interest on
                            amounts so paid, and declaring an emergency.
                        Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend the bill by striking out all after the
                            enacting: clause, and inserting an appropriation of $640,000 for the
                            payment of the several installment interest due on the State debt, to be
                            disbursed by the Treasurer.
                        Mr. C. said his proposition was simply to pay the interest on the State
                            debt through the Treasurer of State-not to pay it to particular
                            individual, as A, B, C, D, &c. By calculation she interest was
                            ascertained to be so much-He desired the yeas and nays on the adoption
                            of the amendment.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. If there was no other object in offering the amendment it
                            would at least delay the passage of the bill. It was well known that
                            this interest could not be paid in the usual form. The Senate bill was
                            as near the usual form as we could get it. Gentlemen were mistaken when
                            they say the definite amount to be paid is ascertained. Winslow, Lanier
                            & Co. were paying this interest now every day.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Could we not know what is the debt, and what the interest?
                            It was an easy matter for us to compute the amount.-Payment could as
                            well be authorized in the usual form now as at any other time past. If
                            any person had seen proper to pay this interest, he has become the
                            creditor of the State, and is entitled to receive the money by the
                            operation of the amendment.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM. We could not pay it in the usual form. There was no Agent of
                            State, at least none to whom we would be willing to transmit the
                            money.
                        Mr. SPENCER. Were not these men (Wins-lows, Lanier & Co.) buying up
                            these coupons and getting them assigned to them as brokers?
                        Mr. HOGATE. They were registered stock.
                        Mr. BROWN. Had not Winslow, Lanier & Go. refused to pay anything for
                            the State till the States' money was deposited to secure them?
                        Mr. BRANHAM never heard any intimation of the kind.
                        Mr. BROWN. It was known that Mr. Brett, the State Treasurer, had
                            deposited $400,000 in New York, to the credit of the original
                            bondholders of the funded debt, and that Winslow, Lanier & Co.,
                            assumed their liability after that.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Either the gentleman from Jackson [Mr. Brown] or himself was
                            mistaken. Prior to the time of the State's interest falling due,
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co. deposited in one of the banks in New York a
                            sum of money sufficient to pay the interest. They had nothing to do with
                            checking out the money-did not pay it from their own counter. It was
                            under the control of the State-deposited to the credit of the State. All
                            he knew about this $400,000 was that it has been customary for the
                            Treasurer of State to transmit and deposit in New York an amount of
                            money sufficient to pay the accruing interest. But Mr. Brett did not do
                            this. As he understood it this $400,000 was not under the control of
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co., but that M. L Brett could take it again
                            to-day. He got his information from Mr. Brett himself. It could not make
                            much difference how this interest is paid, so it is paid. Better let Mr.
                            Brett do the business: for, considering the extraordinary circumstances
                            under which Mr. B. hag been placed, Mr. Branham thought he acted very
                            prudently-saying nothing about his refasing to pay the interest when
                            due.
                        Mr. BROWN. What was the rate of interest proposed by the Senate bill-was
                            it the rate in the bonds ?
                        Mr BRANHAM. Seven per cent.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. When was it ever heard of that a State had paid interest
                            upon interest?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. When was it ever heard tell of that a State refused to pay
                            her debts, with plenty of money in the Treasury ?
                        Mr. BROWN. It was when a Governor refused to call the Legislature
                            together to make the appropriation.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. As to the question of interest upon interest, the State had
                            been making money out of funds which should have paid this interest. He
                            understood that she had realised some $12,000 or$14,000 by the
                            financeering of the Treasurer.
                        Mr. DUNHAM would like to ask the gentleman whether there is anything due
                            to the State Treasurer for that service--whether that $12,-000 or
                            $14,000 amounts to anything more than this: that the State Treasurer had
                            received into the Treasury as a part of the revenue of the State
                            interest bearing Treasury Notes? Were these $12,000 anything more than
                            the proceeds ?
                        Mr. BRANHAM'S understanding was that these interest-bearing Treasury
                            notes were not received for revenue--that they were bought by the
                            Treasurer for the purpose of making money.
                        Mr. DUNHAM asked for the authority of law by which the Treasurer should
                            change that money?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It was in the same volume where the law was found
                            authorizing pay for the State printing.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. That would do very well for buncombe, but he would be obliged
                            to the gentleman to show the particular clause of the law that
                            authorizes the Treasurer to make that exchange. On the contrary, he
                            would ask the gentleman whether there was not a positive law against
                            it?
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, read from Gavin & Hord, page 650, to show the
                            authority for the Treasurer to have paid the interest as it fell due. He
                            had understood that some of this interest had been paid from the
                            Treasury, which had been made necessary on account of rebel
                            confiscations--it having been thought better to pay it than to go into
                            court. He spoke no blame against the Treasurer. He could see no reason
                            why we should not pay interest upon interest to Winslow, Lanier &
                            Co., on the money actually paid out for us.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK showed that Mr. Branham's objection was not well taken. There
                            were four installments of interest due and unpaid-those of July, 1863,
                            January and July, 1864, and January, 1875. These four installments
                            amounted to $640,000 at the rate of interest fixed by law--part bearing
                            5 per cent, and part 2% per cent. The amendment of the gentleman from
                            Huntington, [Mr. Coffroth,] proposes to appropriate that sum. The
                            gentleman had said all the interest has to be paid. Concede it. The
                            amendment provides that the Treasurer of State shall pay to the
                            bondholders such interest as shall be due on their bonds. Then it
                            provides that he shall pay to the assignees of the bondholders the
                            amount due them. In that way it provides for the whole interest due the
                            last two years. The Senate bill simply makes an appropriation for the
                            amount that has been paid by Winslow, Lanier & Co., and leaves
                            unpaid the amount that has not yet been claimed by the bondholders. Some
                            of the bondholders had not fifed their claims.-- The original bill makes
                            no provision for such--the amendment does. The gentleman conceded that
                            there is a difficulty in making payment in the usual way, in COD
                            sequence of the particular condition of the Agent of State. By the terms
                            of the amendment, this money was placed tinder the control of the State
                            Treasurer, who was direcred and empowered to pay it out. This was the
                            advantage of the amendment over the original bill; it makes an
                            appropriation for the whole amount of interest due the last two years,
                            while the Senate bill is only for the amount that; has been paid by
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB understood that the amendment proposes making an
                            appropriation for the interest on the debt--ignoring the fact that the
                            interest has been advanced and paid by Wins-low, Lanier & Co., and
                            ignoring, also, the fact that they have been requested to do so. The  original bill recognizes both--that
                            the State's creditors were satisfied--that these men had become our
                            creditors in their stead. He objected to delay; every day's delay
                            increased our indebtedness to this firm, and the bill ought to be passed
                            promptly. Members are going home at 12 o'clock. He would move to lay the
                            amendment on the table.
                        Mr. DUNHAM appealed to the gentleman to withdraw that motion.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. All we ask is to have a square vote on the amendment.
                        Mr. BROWN. And we might go to Madison.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB withdrew the motion, and demanded the previous question.
                        The SPEAKER, The previous question applies simply to the pending
                            amendment.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB withdrew the demand.
                        Mr. Coffroth demanding the yeas and nays they were ordered and taken,
                            resulting--yeas 31, nays 49--as follows:

                        So Mr. COFFROTH'S amendment was rejected, and the question recurred on
                            the engrossment of the bill.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend by striking out all after the enacting
                            clause and inserting the following:
                         That the sum of $640,000 be and the same is hereby appropriated to pay
                            the interest upon the public debt, falling due July, 1863, January and
                            July, 1864, and January, 1865. That upon the passage and approval of
                            this act, the Auditor of State shall draw his warrant on the Treasurer
                            of State for said sum of money, and that said sum of money is hereby
                            placed under the control of the Treasurer of State, who is authorized,
                            empowered and directed to pay the owners of the bonds of the State such
                            interest as may be due and unpaid thereon, and to the assignee or
                            assignees of the several installments of interest on such bonds, and the
                            said Treasurer is directed to take proper receipts for such interest,
                            and an assignment to the State of the assignments made by the
                            bondholders for such interest. 
                         Section 2. That interest at the same rate as is borne by the bonds
                            themselves shall be paid to the bondholders or their assigns us on the
                            unpaid installments of interest on such bonds from the time such
                            installments became due to the present time; and such farther sum is
                            hereby appropriated as may be required to pay such interest on the
                            unpaid installments of interest on our public bonds. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It would be perceived that the only difference between this
                            and the amendment of the gentleman from Huntington, [Mr. Coffroth,] was
                            in the second section. la the first section it provides for an
                            appropriation of $640,000. t The second section provides that we will
                            pay interest at the rate of five per cent, end 2 1/2 per cent. Say
                            $5,000,000 of the bonds bear interest at 5 per cent. And all
                            advancements to pay the State's interest to the present time shall draw
                            5 per cent. Then say there are three millions of the debt only bearing 2
                            1/2 per-cent ; we propose to pay that amount of interest on the advances
                            mads on that. Winslow, Lanier & Co., having paid it, we propose to
                            allow them just the same rate of interest that the bonds themselves
                            beer. We do not know upon what principle these gentlemen in New York can
                            voluntarily make payment of the State's interest at 2 1/2 per cent, and
                            than ask us to pay them 7 per cent. It is a well known principle of law,
                            that the sovereign never pays interest except it chooses to do so. Now
                            if this had been paid on contract with Winslow, Lanier & Co., then I
                            concede that the law of the State of New York would govern as to the
                            amount of interest. But when I asked Mr. Chapman about that the other
                            day, in the Senate Chamber--and he was at the time consulting with the
                            Governor--he said there was no such claim or understanding with Winslow,
                            Lanier & Co.--that there was no contract. It is not pretended that
                            there was any contract for the payment of seven per cent, or any other
                            rate of interest. Then, as there is no legal demand for interest, we
                            propose to pay the same amount of interest the bands themselves call
                            for.
                        Mr. CHURCH demanded the previous question.
                        Mr. BROWN. If this gag system is adopted, and we are to be cut off from
                            discussion, we will take the responsibility of doing what we should to
                            protect our rights.
                        The Speaker's hammer interposed, and there was a second to the demand for
                            the previous question.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on the main question, which being
                            taken, resulted--yeas 44, nays 33.
                        So the main question was ordered, viz: "Shall the Buskirk amendment be
                            adopted?"
                        Mr. BUSKIRK Moved that the House adjourn; but on consultation he moved on
                            order that when the Houss adjourns to-day it shall be till Monday at 2
                            o'clock P. M., which was agreed to.
                        On motion by Mr. HIGGINS, it was--
                        
                            
                                

                                    Ordered, [informally,] That this subject be
                                        made the special order for Monday, 3 o'clock P. M.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from Private Secretary
                            B. R. Sulgrove, stating that Mr. Brown's Common Pleas Court Bill, [H. R. 3,] had been approved and
                            signed by the Governor.
                        Mr. Thatcher obtained leave of absence for Mr. White.
                        And then--at 12:5 P. M.--the House adjourned till Monday, 2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                    

                


                


                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        MONDAY, January 23, 1865.
                    
                     The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR resumed the Chair at two o'clock p. m., and directed
                        a call of the Senate, but at the suggestion of a Senator, [Mr. Brown, of
                        Wells,] it was not proceeded with.



                    
                        WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, asked and obtained leave to record his vote "no" on
                            the passage of Senate bill No, 49. He understood that Wins-  Winslow, & Lanier & Co. never paid
                            out one dollar of their own money in behalf of the State, but that there
                            was an arrangement between them and the Treasurer of State, whereby they
                            were abundantly secured; and that the profits expected to be derived
                            from the appropriation of money which has already been voted by this
                            Senate, was merely a part of the spoils to be divided between the
                            parties in this transaction. When the Legislature, by the revolutionary
                            action of the Republican members of the last session was broken up,
                            there were suggestions at once made by conservative Democratic members,
                            that if an extra session were called an appropriation would be passed to
                            meet the interest on the State debt. Subsequently there were written
                            assurances procured from various Democratic members of both branches of
                            the General Assembly, to the effect that if an extra session was called,
                            they would pledge themselves the first measures of that extra session
                            should be the passage of the necessary appropriation bills to pay the
                            interest on the State debt and to carry on the public institutions.
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co. were cognizant of these pledges, and they were
                            well acquainted with the political complexion which attended the matter
                            at that time; yet under this peculiar private arrangement, already
                            hinted at, this interest was paid upon the State debt. Under these
                            circumstances, without elaborating to any greater extent, he ventured
                            the assertion that this General Assembly, or rather the State of
                            Indiana, is no-more indebted to Winslow, Lanier & Co. than to him;
                            and if the same private arrangement had been put in his hands he would
                            have been just as able to have paid off the interest on the State debt
                            as Winlow, Lanier & Co, For these reasons he voted against the
                            bill.
                        Mr. BENNETT asked what was the private arrangement referred to.
                        Mr. BROWN had intimated that there was a private arrangement, and his
                            information came from such an authentic source that he could not doubt
                            it. He might have been misinformed, but upon his information be was bold
                            to make this statement. Under a different understanding-he had said he
                            should vote for this appropriation, but then a different phase has been
                            given to this matter, and of course he could not vote for it now.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. Do I understand that by an arrangement of the Treasurer of
                            State the interest was paid?
                        Mr. BROWN understood that the Treasurer of State deposited moneys in New
                            York, and that it was the State's money that paid the interest and not
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co.'s money.
                        Mr. OYLER, If the Treasurer of State has made any such private
                            arrangement it is a matter that ought to be Inquired into by the
                            Legislature. At the proper time this Senate and the Legislature will owe
                            it to themselves to inquire into this matter, and if necessary appoint a
                            committee with power to send far persons and papers He looked upon it as
                            a fraud practiced upon the Legislature, if the charge be true as made by
                            the gentleman.
                        Mr. BROWN desired to say again that his information might not be correct,
                            and yet it came from such an authentic source that he could not doubt
                            it. He would be willing to vote for the measure suggested by the
                            gentleman from Johnson. He noticed by the proceedings in the House as
                            reported last week that there must have been some idea of this kind
                            there. 
                    


                    
                        FEES OF COUNTY AND STATE OFFICERS.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the committee--one from each
                            Congressional District--to which was referred Mr. Dunning's bill [S. 67]

                            compensation, was referred to this committee.

                            region, to the serious inconvenience of the petitioners and others,
                            which was read and referred to the Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges.

                            praying for a change in the law granting licenses to sell spirituous
                            liquors, so that the applicant shall be compelled to procure the
                            signature of a majority of the voters in the town before obtaining a
                            license, which was referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance.
                        Mr. DUNNING presented a petition from the Treasurer of Brown county,
                            praying for relief in the sum of $3,555 59-public money stolen from the
                            safe provided by the commissioners of said county, which was referred to
                            the Committee on Finance.

                        Mr. MOORE, from the select committee thereon, returned his bill, [S. 42 ] changing the times of

                         PROPOSAL TO SELL SWAMP LANDS.
                        Mr. WRIGHT introduced a joint resolution, [12,] authorizing the Auditor
                            and Treasurer of State to sell certain swamp lands belonging to the
                            State, and conveyed to the State by the General Government, November
                            7,1857, known as indemnity lands, which was read the first time.
                        On motion by Mr. WRIGHT it was read the second time, by title only, and
                            referred to the Committee on Swamp Lands.

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Finance be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of passing a law exempting the property of all
                                        soldiers from execution while absent from home in the
                                        service of the United States, with leave to report by bill
                                        or otherwise.

                        Mr. MOORE offered the following, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Finance be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of reporting a bill exempting from taxation five
                                        hundred dollars' worth of property belonging to widows and
                                        orphans, and that they report at as early a day as is
                                        possible.

                        Mr. DOWNEY offered the following, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            County and Township business be instructed to
                                        inquire what farther legislation, if any, is necessary to
                                        promote uniformity in the assessment of the value of
                                        articles of personal property, of the same kind, in the
                                        different townships of each county, and report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    




                    
                         WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        Mr. OYLER offered the following:


                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, It has been charged upon the
                                        floor of the Senate, by a member of the Senate, that in the
                                        payment of the interest of the debt of the State of Indiana
                                        for the past two years, by Messrs. Winslow, Lanier &
                                        Co., that the said Winslow, Lanier & Co. did not use
                                        their own funds, but that they made an arrangement with the
                                        State Treasurer, by which the funds of the State were used
                                        in the payment of said interest; therefore,
                                    Be it Resolved, That the Treasurer of State
                                        be requested to report to this House, at an early day, it
                                        any such arrangement was made, and that a committee of------
                                        be appointed to inquire into the facts, with power to send
                                        for persons and papers.
                                
                            
                        

                         Mr. CULVER thought, the resolution calling upon the Treasurer of State
                            to furnish the desired information was sufficient; and if his report was
                            not satisfactory, then the Committee of Investigation
                            could be authorized. He had no doubt that the money was in New York, but
                            with the understanding that the claim would bs paid; and thought it was
                            still subject to the order of the Treasurer of State. If there was
                            anything wrong about the matter, of course he would favor a full, fair
                            and free investigation. He moved to strike out of the resolution all
                            that refers to the appointment of a committee
                        Mr. OYLER was astonished at the remarks coming from the Senator from
                            Wells. Were he convinced of this fact, he would change his vote upon the
                            passage of the bill. But what harm could be done by authorizing a
                                Committee of Investigation? His purpose was not
                            to be discourteous to Mr. Brett; the Treasurer of State; on the
                            contrary, that gentleman could have no objection to such a committee,
                            but would rather desire it. The charge has gone out-it is all over the
                            length and breadth of this land, and we cannot stop it. That gentleman
                            stands accused at the bar of public opinion of a base attempt to swindle
                            this people out of thirty or forty thousand dollars and divide the
                            proceeds with Winslow, Lanier & Co. We owe it not only to ourselves
                            but to these gentlemen that this matter should be sifted to the bottom.
                            He did not believe for one moment that there was any truth in it, but
                            insisted there was a necessity for an investigation to free these
                            gentlemen from the imputation.

                        Mr. VAWTER had no objection to a thorough, full, free and fair
                            investigation, but as a personal and political friend of the Treasurer
                            of State objected to a call for an official communication from that
                            officer, coupled with a resolution authorizing the appointment of a
                            committee to investigate the facts therein to be set forth. At the time
                            this interest was paid, Winslow,Lanier & Co. used their own moneys
                            and sometime last March or April, upon consultation with various
                            individuals, Matthew L. Brett not as Treasurer of State, deposited with
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co. $400,000-the money, so far as the papers show,
                            his own--and the interest upon that stands credited to the State of
                            Indiana,
                        Mr. DUNNING hoped the Senator from Johnson, [Mr. Oyler,] upon reflection
                            would modify  his resolution so as
                            to leave off that part which calls for a committee. The statement from
                            Mr. Brett would be a statement of facts. He was tired of hearing charges
                            that there was something wrong about this transaction. What induced him
                            to vote for the passage of the bill was the fact that the money was
                            advanced by Winslow, Lanier & Co. He thought they were entitled to
                            interest upon it. If any arrangement has been made between the Treasurer
                            of State and Winslow, Lanier & Co, by which the money of the State
                            has been used, and not the money of Winslow, Lanier & Co., let
                            Senators who voted for the passage of the bill know that they have been
                            deceived, but if they have not been deceived, and these are mere rumors,
                            for the purpose of reflecting upon the party who has advocated and voted
                            for the passage of this bill, let us be enabled to say that we stand
                            justified before the public, and than these are mere rumors, circulated
                            by men who don't consider the matter as they ought. This remark does not
                            apply to the Senator from Wells, as he has not made a charge here for
                            which he vouches as a Senator.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, thought he had sufficiently explained himself. He
                            repeated, the rumor might not be reliable. This is a mutter he had not
                            heard within the political circles of the capital of our State, but it
                            was circulated throughout; the State-he beard it before he cams to the
                            capital, and it was on that account he thought it might be something
                            more than a rumor.
                        Mr. CORBIN had been laboring under the same kind of delusion the Senator
                            from Wells had. He had been relying upon Madam Rumor for the statement
                            in regard to when this deposit was made by the Treasurer of State with
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co. He was told as he supposed from authority that
                            could be relied upon that the Treasurer deposited some $400,000 in
                            March, 1864, but had since round out from the Treasurer himself that the
                            papers of assignment were made at the same time the deposit was made,
                            and that was in November last. He would not be willing to call upon the
                            Treasurer for information by a resolution, which at the same time would
                            be casting a censure upon that officer; and consequently favored the
                            motion to strike out.
                        Mr. McCLURG favored the amendment proposed by the Senator from
                            Tippecanoe, [Mr. Culver.] There seems to be too slender a foundation
                            upon which to compel, by resolution, the Treasurer of State to make a
                            report to the Senate, and at the same time coupling it with the guards
                            of a committee to investigate, for fear his report might not be
                            correct.
                        Mr. THOMPSON was surprised to hear this charge made by the Senator from
                            Wells. In the discussion of this question gentlemen on the opposite side
                            must have brought out all the points before the Senate-there could have
                            been nothing left out. If anything of this kind existed, the Senators
                            from Lawrence and Vigo had the intelligence and boldness to have
                            presented it; and were it a fact, there is not one Senator here who
                            would have countenanced the bill. Under no circumstances can the Senate
                            avoid giving this a fall and fair investigation. When a Senator gets up
                            and makes a statement here, he regarded it as a matter of great
                            importance; the community attaches importance to it, and the Senator's
                            district attaches importance to it; and every honest man must, because
                            the Senator is supposed to be acting under a solemn oath.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, thought it singular that he did not get himself
                            clearly understood. He did not attach sufficient importance to this
                            rumor to allow that to control his action in regard to the bill. It was
                            for weightier reasons that he voted against the bill. He wished it
                            distinctly understood that he characterized it as an intimation, and
                            nothing more, of a private arrangement between Mr. Brett, Winslow,
                            Lanier & Co. and the Governor. And now for gentlemen to get up and
                            magnify that intimation into something of great importance, is assuming
                            the character of the ridiculous more than anything else. The fact that
                            he heard it, outside of the political capital is in favor of the opinion
                            he had formed, particularly when he heard it through good sources-men in
                            high positions-men who have enjoyed the confidence of the people of the
                            State. He was almost tempted to name them, and would do so but for fear
                            it might be betraying confidence. He trusted circumstances may exist
                            which would entirely satisfy us all. A simple resolution requesting the
                            Treasurer of State to report, is all that is necessary, under the
                            circumstances. He trusted what he had now said would afford a sufficient
                            explanation of the statements he made at first.
                        Mr. OYLER withdrew that portion of his resolution, which authorized the
                            appointment of a committee.
                        The resolution as modified was adopted.
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        MONDAY, January 23, 1865.
                    
                     The SPEAKER took the Chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and directed the Clerk to
                        call the roll.
                    A quorum being thus ascertained and reported present and answering to their
                        names- and the journal of Saturday having been read and approved-


                    
                        WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        The SPEAKER stated the special order-the consideration of the bill [S. No. 49] to repay Winslow,
                            Lanier & Co.,-the question pending when the House adjourned on
                            Saturday, was the adoption of the amendment of Mr. Buskirk. Thereupon
                            the House was under the operation of the previous question, the main
                            question had been ordered to be put, and the yeas and nays had been
                            demanded and ordered.
                        
                        The yeas and nays being taken thereon resulted-yeas 33, nays 45-as
                            follows:

                        
                            
                                

                                    YEAS-Messrs. Abbett, Becket, Bird, Brown, Buskirk, Collins,
                                        Colover, Groan, Glazebrook, Gregg, Hargrove, Humphreys,
                                        Hunt, Laselle, Lemon, Lopp, Miller of Clinton, Milroy,
                                        O'Brien, Osborn, Patterson, Perigo, Puett, Richardson,
                                        Roach, Shoaff of Allen, Shoaff of Jay, Spencer, Stenger.
                                        Stuckey, Veach and White-33.
                                    NAYS-Messrs. Banta, Boyd, Branham, Burnes, Church, Cox,
                                        Crook, Foulke, Goodman, Gregory of Montgomery, Gregory of
                                        Warren, Griffith, Groves, Henricks, Hershey, Higgins,
                                        Hogate, Hoover, Johnson, Kilgore, Major, Meredith, Miller of
                                        Tippecanoe Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb, Oleman, Prather, Reese, Rhods, Riford,
                                        Sabin, Shuey, Sim, Stewart, Trussler, Upson, Welch,
                                        Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zeigler and Mr. Speaker-45.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the amendment was rejected.
                        The question recurred on ordering the bill to be engrossed.
                        Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the bill as follows:
                        Amend the preamble by inserting the following:"
                        
                            
                                
                                    AND WHEREAS, Such bond-holders as assigned
                                        to Winslow, Lanier & Co. their claims for installments
                                        of interest, who assigned the same to Mathew L. Brett, who
                                        is now the legal holder thereof."
                                
                            
                        
                        Amend the first section by striking out the names of Winslow, Lanier
                            & Co., and insert-the name of Matthew L Brett.
                        Mr. B. said the preamble set forth all he desired to say now. These bonds
                            were not coupon bonds, but registered bonds. The holders' claims for
                            interest on them were assigned to Winslow, Lanier & Co., who agreed
                            to pay the interest when due. At the same time Matthew L. Brett
                            deposited with Winslow, Lanier & Co, about $400,000, and afterwards
                            a smaller sum, amounting together to about $600,000; and then Winslow;
                            Lanier & Co. assigned the assignments they held from the original
                            bondholders to Matthew L. Brett, who now holds these assignments. To
                            whom, then, was the State Indedbted?--to Winslow, Lanier & Co., or
                            to Matthew L. Brett? In his judgment, the State could only take up these
                            assignments by paying this interest to Matthew L. Brett.
                        Mr. DUNHAM said a disposition was manifested Saturday to cut off debate
                            on this question. He and those who acted with him desired to be
                            recognized on this floor, as peers of the representatives of the people
                            from other portions of the State, be they of whatever political faith
                            they may. He desired to have it felt that they represent a tax-paying
                            people, having interests in the welfare of the State, and a people of as
                            much earnest patriotism as any claiming representation on this floor.
                            They had a right to be heard candidly and fairly; and then, if the
                            majority chose to pass the bill, he and his friends' had simply to say
                            amen, and let them take the responsibility.
                        This was not simply a question whether we are willing to pay this
                            interest and uphold the credit of the State. Not a Democrat here that
                            did not want this: we all wanted it. But there was that in this question
                            which rises above all the State credit itself-it was a question of the
                            constitutional rights of the citizens of the State, involving a great
                            fundamental principle which lies at the foundation of the State and
                            national Governments-that the voice of the people shall be heard in the
                            administration of the Government. State credit was as nothing by the
                            side of this principle. It was the right of the people, through their
                            representatives, (not the Exeutive) to appropriate the money which they
                            contribute for the administration of the Government, according to the
                            laws which they, through their representatives, shall make. State credit
                            amounted to but little, when you take from the people this right. State
                            credit was valuable only as it secures the authority and influence of
                            the State to protect the rights of the citizen.
                        He started at this point that no money should be taken from the people,
                            except by the consent of the people's representatives. "Money was power,
                            and from the earliest, days of English history, from which we have
                            copied our civil rights to a great extent, they have held the
                            fundamental right of the people to appropriate money as the corner-stone
                            of their liberties. Give to the Executive the power to take the peoples
                            money and appropriate it as he pleases, and public liberty would soon
                            sink into insignificance. This was not a question of State credit so
                            much as it was an inquiry whether the laws and Constitution of the State
                            shall be maintained in the administration of the Government? Whether the
                            Executive of the State, without the advice and consent of the people's
                            representatives, shall take it upon himself to judge of the necessities
                            of the Government, and in his own phrase, run the machine on his
                            own-account?
                        The man that would take away from the people the control of the money of
                            the State he regarded as disloyal, not merely to the integrity, but to
                            the very existence of the State. Here we split--he and his friends being
                            accounted disloyal, because they did not believe the course pursued by
                            Governor Morion would uphold the character of the State and secure the
                            rights and liberties of the people.
                        What were gentlemen attempting to do? They wanted to pay the interest,
                            not to the creditors of the State, but to Winslow, Lanier & Co. He
                            had told the Committee on Ways and Means, the only
                            time he had been in session with that committee, that he was willing to
                            vote for an appropriation of money--$640,000 as proposed by the
                            amendment of the gentlemen from Monroe, leaving it in the hands of the
                            Treasurer to pay to those entitled to receive it. But that would not
                            answer the end that is aimed at here. The end and object of the majority
                            was not merely to pay interest upon interest, but to uphold the course
                            of Governor Morton--to say to us that we must sanction what we believe
                            to be an usurpation on the part of the Executive. Here was where we ate
                            invited to issue, and here he was determined to put himself right.
                        The Governor and his friends had contended, that no appropriation to pay
                            the interest on the State debt was necessary. The Governor had told us
                            as much in his message, intimating that the disbursing officers of the
                            Treasury had been guilty of a dereliction of public duty. Was it not
                            necessary? Then to-morrow, if he mistook not, the new Auditor of State
                            went into office; and if he conscientiously believed what the Governor
                            and his friends have said if true, he has nothing to do but to draw his
                            warrant on the Treasury for this money. But that he would not attempt to
                            do. But gentlemen come now and ask an appropriation--and they were
                            urging its passage with the fact that this debt was increasing $140 a
                            day--when they have been telling the country for the last year that no
                            appropriation was necessary, and that the Auditor and Treasurer of State
                            were guilty of a dereliction of duty. Gentlemen could not escape this
                            point. No need of further proof of this official dissimulation.
                            Gentlemen come in here, and by their votes  endorse what the Treasury officers did,
                            andwhat Ristine, and Brett, and Hord have said, as often as they vote
                            and ask us to vote for this $640,000. It was not necessary to discuss
                            the authority of law for the Treasurer to pay his or not. It was enough
                            for him to point to the decision of the Supreme Court, and to say that
                            it was not the prerogative of Governor Morton to stand up and say that
                            the decisions of the Supreme Court are not the law of the land; and
                            Governor Horton himself was just as much bound by them as the humblest
                            clodhopper in the land.
                        As to the plea that Winslow, Lanier & Co. had paid this money to
                            sustain the credit of the State, Mr. D. spoke at length. Mr. Lanier knew
                            the law--had practiced in the Supreme Court of the State, and understood
                            the whole question--understood the power of the Executive, the State
                            officers, and the controlling power of the General Assembly in the case.
                            It was heralded by the Indianapolis Journal that the Governor had made
                            this arrangement, with this firm without giving them any legal claim on
                            the Governor or the State--that they did it out of pure patriotic regard
                            for the credit of the State. But now since the election, there was some
                            difference. Now they wanted usance for their money--about seven per
                            cent, as a salvo for their tender regard for the credit of the State of
                            Indiana. They knew, if the Governor was wrong, they were particeps criminis in the transaction. He was himself lawyer
                            enough to tell them that, and be argued the correctness of the
                            principle, These bankers knowing this, they carefully provided for their
                            repayment; and the fact of that careful provision was rehearsed in the
                            pending amendment submitted by the gentleman from Jackson [Mr. Brown.]
                            In all his legal life he had never seen a case more carefully
                            guarded--it was most carefully planned to carry out the political
                            schemes of the Governor and secure the interests of these bankers.
                        Mr. D. spoke an hour, bringing other considerations to bear on the
                            question.
                        When he had concluded, and fortified his position with illustrations and
                            readings from the law-
                        A message from the Senate was received announcing the action of that body
                            on sundry propositions.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The only question before us was, whether we should repay the
                            gentlemen that have advanced a large amount of money for the State. Bat
                            the gentleman from Floyd had found another-the question of the credit of
                            the State in the rights of the people. He would tell that gentleman that
                            the people had already decided that question. The issue had been made in
                            the late election all over the State, and the people had sustained the
                            Governor, Would any man feel himself outraged by his neighbor that might
                            step forward and pay his debt, and save him from protest in bank? Such
                            was the act of Winslow, Lanier & Co. He was glad that we had a
                            Governor capable of grasping the great issues of the two years past, and
                            saving the imperilled credit of the State without calling the former
                            Legislature together. This was a debt of honor. It was of more justly
                            binding force than that of a debt by the judgment of the courts. The
                            gentleman had at last said that he was willing to pay this interest-not
                            to Winslow, Lanier & Co., but to Mr. Brett. He admitted the rule of
                            law, that where his friend paid his debt voluntarily, there was no
                            obligation of law to compel him to repay his friend. But be considered
                            the law in this case, as in a bill of exchange, paid by an acceptor for
                            horror. The law merchant would support an action for the accepter for
                            honor. He regarded the act that saved the calling again together of the
                            last Legislature as a, great public benefaction. No Legislature had done
                            so much as that to destroy the Constitution of the State, whereof the
                            gentleman would seem to be so tender. He could not see the wisdom of
                            calling that Legislature back to do anything else for the State. The
                            gentleman had taken the position that the passage of the Senate, bill
                            would amount to an indorsement cf the decision of the Supreme Court
                            sustaining the State officers in refusing to pay this interest as it
                            fell due. The provisions of law (which he read,) was clear against that.
                            The maxim that the sovereign never pays interest, was not binding in
                            cases where interest had been promised or contracted to be paid. And
                            where was the law which prescribes that we should pay only the interest
                            named in the State bonds? He showed that in such cases the statute
                            prescribes that interest shall be paid. If the State were entitled to be
                            sued in her own courts, she would be compelled to pay interest on the
                            Winslow claim at six per cent. That rate in the State of New York was
                            seven per cent.
                        Mr. BROWN interposed a question whether it should be the interest
                            mentioned in the bonds, or the New York rate.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. He was asserting no new principle. When money becomes due,
                            it bears interest. We should not ask them to take less than the New York
                            rate. Investments of their money in Government bonds would have paid
                            them 15 per cent. A just exposition of law required this payment; and
                            justice and equity required it without law.
                        The last session of the Legislature was not the first example of breaking
                            a quorum. He referred to that of 1858, when it was done by Democrats
                            upon the simple question as to whether one man or another should
                            represent a certain district in the State Senate. And he recounted how
                            the trust funds of the State had disappeared under the hand of
                            Democratic Legislatures. And to this day neither the school fund nor the
                            swamp land fund, &c., had been repaid. Governor Willard did not call
                            again that Legislature. And the gentleman from Floyd, who held the
                            office of Secretary of State at the time, had not complained of
                            Willard's "running the machine" alone.
                        Mr. DUNHAM insisted that his opposition to that part of the Willard
                            administration was well known in the State. The acts of 1859 were passed
                            to guard the State's interest in such cases, which Governor Morton
                            violated.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB saw no violation of law by Governor Morton. He proceeded to
                            show that, notwithing the lack of appropriations, Democratic officials
                            received their pay. He did not speak as though he would be regarded as
                            cen- [cen]sorions upon the acts of
                            the dead. But if it was praiseworthy in. Governor Willard to take money
                            out of the Treasury without law in 1857, where was the blame against
                            Governor Morten, because he finds men in New York to advance nearly half
                            a million of dollars to save the State's credit? He gave instances of
                            the facility with which Democratic members had broken a quorum on bills
                            that were not worth the paper on which they were written, as well as on
                            the gravest questions of legislation. But to break a quorum with them
                            was unconstitutional now. Like other quack doctors, they had got sick on
                            their own medicine. They said let by-gones be by-gones, but at the same
                            time, they were ready to raise political issues on almost every
                            question.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said he was desirous of closing the discussion. He rehearsed
                            the provisions of the Senate bill, and the effect of Mr. Brown's
                            amendment, and submitted the facts which justify the amendment. He
                            proceeded to read a copy of the receipt taken of the State creditors by
                            Winslow, Lanier & Co., to the following effect: "We, whose names are
                            hereunto subscribed, in consideration of cash paid us by Winslow, Lanier
                            & Co., do assign to Winslow, Lanier & Co. all sums of money
                            payable to us by the State of Indiana, as they stand opposite to our
                            names, and we hereby constitute the said Winslow, Lanier & Co. our
                            attorney to draw the same in our name--to collect and receive the same,
                            and receipt there" 
                        We had been told, that to protect the credit of the State this firm had
                            come forward voluntarily and paid the interest due on the public debt;
                            but this statement was questionable. It had been stated, also, that they
                            relied solely on the good faith of the State to repay them. But they did
                            not rely on the faith of the State. They presented here such a claim as
                            legally entitled them to demand of the State the interest they advanced
                            to the bondholders. They did not pay a dollar till they obtained the
                            assignment he had read, winch gave them the same right to demand
                            interest of the State which the bondholders themselves had. But now,
                            what interest have Winslow, Lanier & Co., in this assignment? By way
                            of answer, Mr. B. read a paper, dated: " Office of Winslow, Lanier &
                            Co., 52 Wall street, N. Y., Nov. 9, 1864," to this effect: "For value
                            received, we hereby assign and transfer to Matthew L. Brett, the
                            assignment made to us by said creditors of the State of Indiana, with
                            full power and authority in the said--Matthew L. Brett to collect the
                            same, and receipt therefor, to the State of Indiana, as fully and
                            completely as we are authorized to do so ourselves." Signed, " Winslow,
                            Lanier & Co." Mr. B. read also a statement by J K. Gapio, that he
                            had attended to the matter of the several payments of money
                            above-mentioned, on behalf of Winslow, Lanier & Co. and for Mr.
                            Hudson, and that he knew they were all correctly made; and certifying
                            that he was placed in the office of Winslow, Lanier & Co. for this
                            purpose by Gov. Morton.
                        Now, said Mr. B., what right have Winslow, Lanier & Co. to demand
                            anything from the State of Indiana? The bondholders assigned to them
                            their claims for interest, and on the 9th of November, 1864, they
                            assigned the bondholders receipt to Matthew L. Brett. Shall we then make
                            payment to this firm? I can no reason for it.
                        The reference to the law-merchant was not good pleading. It did not
                            govern in this case. He gave examples. All that could be legally claimed
                            against the State was the interest mentioned in her bonds. If the State
                            failed to pay the interest, when due, there was no legal claim for a
                            greater rate than the bonds call for. He recited the facts in the whole
                            transaction. Winslow, Lanier & Co. took the State creditors'
                            assignments, as in a business transaction, to obtain a legal claim
                            against the State.
                        There was this difference between Democratic and Republican bolting,
                            (both equally reprehensible and unconstitutional;) Democrats,unlike
                            Republicans, never defeated important legislation by it.
                        Hereupon followed a conversation across the House, in which Mr. Newcomb,
                            Mr. Griffith, and Mr. Kilgore took part, with reference to questions and
                            recollections of the Republican bolt in the close of the sessions of
                            1863 and 1858.
                        Mr. B. showed the impossibility of passing what is called "the military
                            bill," if Republicans had remained in their places and resisted it. It
                            would have been time enough for them to have broken a quorum after the
                            Governor's veto. Then the Governor himself would have defeated it by
                            retention. The plea of bolting on account of the military bill was not
                            sustained by the facts. It was a sheer pretence. He was himself opposed
                            to the bill; and when voted for its engrossment, he explained that be
                            did so to enable him to move a reconsideration of the vote.
                        There was an outside understanding last Saturday that we were to offer
                            our amendments to this bill without debate. It was known, of course,
                            that they would be voted down. But when the gentlemen from Huntington
                            submitted his amendment, and before half a dozen sentences were spoken
                            upon it, a demand was made for the previous question. I then adverted to
                            the outside understanding and appealed ineffectually to gentlemen to
                            take on the gag, because the gentleman from Floyd desired to be heard. I
                            then said I had amendment which would give the gentleman from Floyd an
                            opportunity. I offered amendment, and again the previous question was
                            demanded in violation of the a outside of the House.
                        Mr. B. gave this explanation to set himself right against an erroneous
                            report of his position in the editorial columns of the Indianapolis
                            Journal of to-day, in which it was stated that he threatened to
                            bolt.
                        Mr. BRANHAM took the floor, but gave way for a motion to adjourn.
                    



                    
                        THE WALKER LECTURE.
                        Mr. BROWN gave notice that the lecture would not take place till
                            Wednesday night.
                        Mr. Stivers obtained a leave of absence.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, (at 5 1/2 o'clock) 
                        The House adjourned till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.

                     The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.

                        pages 54 and 63) lie on the table. 


                    
                        NEW PROPOSITlONS.
                        
                        The following described bills were introduced read the first time, and
                            severally passed to the second reading, except in the case stated.
                        By Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, [S. 80,] to amend section 18 of an act to repeal all

                        Mr. DUNNING, by request of the Doorkeeper, stated that a flag which could
                            be hoisted upon the dome and hauled down as occasion might require,
                            would cost the sum of $200, and as the resolution of the Senate
                            contained a proviso, that the flag must be procured on reasonable terms
                            or not at all, the Doorkeeper desired some expression on the part of the
                            Senate as to whether $200 was a reasonable sum to pay for the flag.
                        SEVERAL SENATORS-"no," "no."
                        The LIEUT. GOVERNOR stated that the Doorkeeper would consider himself
                            exonerated from further action under that resolution, as the sum named
                            is not a reasonable price.

                            Senate bills numbered 71 to 79 inclusive (introduced yesterday) were

                            Pleas Courts, on appeals from judgments of Justices of the Peace, coming
                            up in regular order, it was read the second time.
                         Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to amend the bill so as to provide that costs
                            shall follow judgments in all cases.

                        INDIANAPOLIS AND THE RECRUITING SERVICE
                         Mr. RICHMOND offered the following, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire by what
                                        authority of law the Common Council of the city of
                                        Indianapolis, by ordinance thereof, prevents the enlistment
                                        of persons into the military service of the United States,
                                        within the corporate limits of the city aforesaid, unless
                                        the person so enlisted shall credit himself upon the quota
                                        required to be raised by said city; and that said committee
                                        report by bill or otherwise, at their earliest

                         GENERAL MUSTERING OFFICE.
                        Mr. BENNETT offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, By the Senate (the House of
                                        Representatives concurring), That the Adjutant General of
                                        the  State of Indiana
                                        be instructed to use his influence to induce the proper
                                        authorities to establish a General Mustering Office in the
                                        city of Indianapolis, where recruits can be mustered and
                                        credited to any district, county, township, or city, in the
                                        State of Indiana, or such other regulations as may produce
                                        the effect of giving districts other than the 6th district,
                                        an equal right to procure volunteers from among persons who
                                        may visit the city where the Military Headquarters of the
                                        State are situated.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT. The object of this resolution is apparent to every Senator.
                            Heretofore, a General Mastering office was established in this city,
                            where recruits could be mustered into the service, and credited to such
                            county, township, or city, as the recruit might elect. This office has
                            lately been abolished, so that now no recruit can be mustered into the
                            service, unless he consents to be credited to the 6th Congressional
                            District, which arrangement works a great injustice to all the other
                            districts. This city is the capital, and military headquarters o the
                            State. Large numbers of persons, seeking opportunities to enlist come
                            hither in order to have the benefit of such bounties as may be offered.
                            Discharged soldiers and those who have served their time cut, although
                            residing in different parts of the State, pass through this city on
                            their way borne, and large numbers of strangers, not residents of the
                            State, visit here, and are willing to enlist. The absence of a General
                            Mustering office prevents other districts from sharing in the enlistment
                            of such persons as recruits, and permits the 6th District to monopolize
                            all this material, which belongs equally to all parts of the State. It
                            might be said that other districts could enlist men here, and have them
                            mustered in such districts as they were desired to be credited to. But,
                            sir, the authorities of the city of Indianapolis, taking advantage of
                            the absence of a General Mustering office, have passed an ordinance
                            prohibiting the recruiting of men in the city for any other district,
                            and severely punishing persons for attempting to do so. Respectable
                            gentlemen from other parts of the State, have come here and recruited
                            men who are not citizens of this district, and when attempting to take
                            them to some other district to be mustered into the service, have been
                            arrested by the city police. Sir, I consider this attempted monopoly an
                            outrage upon the people of the State. Some of my constituents have been
                            here, and although instructed by the liberal and patriotic people whom I
                            have the honor to represent, to pay bounties of five hundred dollars for
                            recruits, yet they were driven off by this infamous city ordinance which
                            seeks to monopolise the business and prevent a competition from liberal
                            counties, with their illiberal arrangements. The city does not belong to
                            the City Council; it is the property cf the whole State, and exists only
                            by reason of the support it has drawn from the people of the State.
                            Soldiers should be allowed to credit themselves where they please. And
                            an equal right, and fair chance to enlist men in this capital, the
                            common property of us all, is all we ask, and that we intend to have. I
                            believe this resolution a proper step toward such an honorable
                            arrangement.
                        Mr. RICHMOND. The motive which induced me to offer the resolution which I
                            did a short time ago is this: A friend of mine the other day picked up a
                            recruit belonging to his county and was taking him back on the cars,
                            when two gentlemen of the city police seized upon him and took him off
                            as a prisoner. I consider it to be an outrage upon the citizens of the
                            State at large, and I think legislation is necessary to check this evil.
                            I introduced the resolution to bring the thing before, the
                                Judiciary Committee, in order that it may be
                            handled in proper style.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. The object of the city ordinance on this subject was to
                            break up the business of bounty brokers who flocked here from all parts
                            of the State. The ordinance, he thought, was gotten up under the advice
                            of certain military officers here, and if wrong he hoped it would be
                            removed. After the city gets clear of these bounty brokers, he thought
                            gentlemen who might come here from different pprtions of the State to
                            obtain recruits in good faith, would be received with kindly
                            feelings.
                        The resolution was then adopted.

                        Mr. DOUGLAS offered the following, which was adopted:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That for greater protection of
                                        the traveling community, the Committee on
                                            Railroads be instructed to examine as to the
                                        expediency of fixing the qualifications of engineers and
                                        conductors on railroads running within the State of Indiana,
                                        and the establishment of a Board of Commissioners, whose
                                        business it shall be to examine and license, if qualified,
                                        applicants for these positions; prohibiting any person
                                        running a train as engineer or conductor, without a
                                        certificate of qualification; and the committee be requested
                                        to report by bill, or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    

                    
                         A DOG TAX.
                        Mr. COBB offered the following, which was adopted: 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on

                        Mr. STEWART, from the Committee on the State Library
                            submitted a report, commending the service of the late Librarian in the
                            neatness and good order of the room-recommending that $1,000 be annually

                        Mr. WHITESIDE having learned that the language of his resolution relative
                            to the matter of this claim on the Douglas portrait was taken as a
                            reflection on the official reputation of the late Librarian, he asked
                            leave to withdraw it. He desired to remove any impression of that sort.

                         THE CLINTON CONTEST.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, rose to a privileged question. He made a further
                            application to the House tor further authority to go out and take the
                            testimony of Mr. Waddell, to be read in the contest for his seat here,
                            to aid him in his defense. He feared that the witness would not obey the
                            summons of the Committee. He was expecting same of his friends to move a
                            resolution for him.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, the contestor for the seat of
                                        Cornelius J. Miller, Representative from the county of
                                        Clinton, has been notified by the contestee in the paid
                                        case, of his (contestee's) intention to proceed to take the
                                        deposition of one B. N. Waddle, on Thursday day the 26th
                                        instant, at Micbigantown in Michigan township in said
                                        county, to be read in evidence in said case; therefore
                                    Resolved, That the said contestee be
                                        allowed to take the deposition of said witness at the said
                                        time and place; and that the same be admitted in evidence in
                                        said content; and that said contestee be granted leave of
                                        absence for that purpose.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. MILLER appealed to the majority to do him justice in this matter. He
                            caused the affidavit of Benjamin M. Waddell to be read by the Clerk, to
                            exculpate him from the censure in some quarters, implied in a surmise
                            that the letter from said Waddell which he had before caused to be read
                            to the House, was not genuine.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted that Mr. Miller had made a case that the House ought
                            to regard, and send a summons to compel the attendance of this
                            witness.
                        Mr. KILGORE made a statement of the proceedings of the Committee
                                on Elections, alleging that there was no intention on the
                            part of any member of the committee to prejudice the rights of either
                            party, He wished only that the matter be attended to soon.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to limit the time of taking this deposition by
                            adding to the resolution these words: "Provided said depositions be
                            taken within/one week from the present time."
                        Mr. COLLINS. The gentleman from Allen accepts the modification.
                        The resolution was adopted.

                            on Mr. Brown's amendment.
                        Mr. BROWN asked and obtained leave to withdraw his amendment, and submit
                            the following amendment to Mr. Shuey's amendment:

                            2 o'clock P. M. this day; and he moved to postpone the further
                            consideration of the special order till that hour.
                        The motionswere severally agreed to.
                    
                    
                        WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                        The SPEAKER next announced the order of the consideration of the hill [S.
                            No. 49] to repay Winslow, Lanier & Co , &c.,-the question being
                            on the adoption of Mr. Brown's amendment.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, (being entitled to the floor,) said it was enough for us to
                            know that the reason this interest was still unpaid was in the failure
                            of the last Legislature, The honor of the State was pledged for the
                            payment of this interest. It was not put upon the ground of a legal
                            obligation, but on higher ground. When the State pledged her honor, it
                            amounted to more than simple compliance with law. The Governor of the
                            State, as every man should, felt an interest in preserving the honor and
                            integrity of the State; and he set about, as in duty bound, to see what
                            he could do in order to preserve the public credit; and he found those
                            who were not only able but willing to step forward and pay this
                            interest. I know that in the last canvass it was said on the opposite
                            side, that they never would refund one dollar of this money. That issue
                            was discussed before the people; and the people made their verdict, and
                            with that verdict I am content.
                        The gentleman from Floyd has made a speech on this subject, in which he
                            carried out the idea that the Governor had trampled under foot the
                            Constitution of the State, and that it was by disregarding that
                            instrument that he was enabled to make these payments. But still we
                            point to this as a faithful act of the Executive Governor Morton never
                            attempted to use one single dollar of the public money to meet this
                            public obligation. He did not propose to divert from the State or County
                            Treasuries one dollar of money controlled by law. But in obedience to
                            the requirements of law he goes about to see if he can maintain the
                            public credit of the State--and he accomplishes it. And there is not a
                            true friend of the State--a man who loves honor, truth and justice in
                            this broad land--but will applaud the act of the Governor, and applaud
                            the act of those men who stepped forward and saved the public credit.
                            And all the gentleman's remarks about violating the Constitution has no
                            more to do with this matter than Don Quixotte's fight with the wind
                            will.
                        But following the gentleman from Floyd, comes the gentleman from Monroe
                            with an amendment to pay these men the same amount of interest due on
                            our bonds.
                        Mr. B. rehearsed the manner of the origination ot this State debt--how
                            the five per cent. bonds were given-and how the 2 1/2 per cents--for
                            accumulated interest.
                        And now, when the Treasury is full of money we refuse to pay this
                            interest. One gentleman says, the State is sovereign, and they can not
                            compel us to pay interest, and you may take what you can get. If that is
                            what is meant by sovereignty, I thank God that I am not a sovereign.
                            But, sir, I will say that no honest man-I make no pretensions as a
                            lawyer-can excuse the State from paying interest on this interest from
                            the time it fell due until it shall be paid.
                        He gave illustrations. He did not propose to ventilate the session of
                            1863 till we shall have got through with these financial questions. Not
                            one dollar of those deposits by Mr. Brett was paid on this interest.
                        Mr. BROWN. Will the gentleman explain then why those deposits of $640,000
                            were made?
                         Mr. BRANHAM. I cannot explain an action that never took place.
                        Mr. BROWN. Why then did Winslow, Lanier & Co. assign their assignment
                            from the bondholders to M. L. Brett?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. I will state the facts. After the failure to pay the
                            interest in July, 1863, Governor Morton made an arrangement with
                            Winslow, Lanier &Co. to make the requisite advancements. But in
                            consequence of a secret combination here in Indiana, Mr. Walker, Agent
                            of State, refused access to the books, so that the interest could not be
                            paid properly. I could read the correspondence that took place
                            thereupon-and I will say that the House owes it to the country to
                            publish that correspondence-but I will not consume time. But after a
                            while they got a copy of the Stock Register-some time in December, 1863,
                            and this company made their deposits for the interest. On the first of
                            January, 1864, their deposits had not all been taken ont. Then they
                            deposited, I think, $94,000 more, for the purpose of paying the January
                            interest.
                        At that time not one dollar had been received in New York from Indiana.
                            They had also paid the interest accruing the July following. And
                            sometime about the first of November, 1864, Mr. Lanier came out here and
                            assign-  ed to Mr. Brett receipts
                            for the interest they had paid, and Mr. Brett makes a special deposit in
                            New York, to his own credit, of about $400,000. Not one dollar of that
                            has been used by Winslow, Lanier & Co., and M. L. Brett can take it
                            out at any time. Consequently, this firm have not used one dollar ot the
                            State's money in this transaction. "What I talk about I got from Mr.
                            Brett. It is true that the money is there to his credit; and it is true,
                            also, that if this bill passes, Winslow, Lanier & Co. will get that
                            money. This is the object of the bill- to settle for the payment of this
                            interest on the State debt, with interest at the New York rate.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. This $630,000 was on special deposit; was it for the purpose
                            of inducing Winslow, Lanier & Co. to pay the January interest; and
                            they refused to pay the January interest until that money was
                            deposited.
                        Mr. BRANHAM explained that Winslow, Lanier & Co. had checked out
                            money deposited for a special purpose. He had the statement of Mr.
                            Lanier corroborated by Mr. Brett, that they bad not used one dollar of
                            that $630,000.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. What benefit did they expect to derive from that deposit of
                            $630,000?
                        Mr. BRANHAM could say nothing more than he had already with reference to
                            the benefit they expected from that deposit.
                        He replied to Mr. Buskirk's allegation yesterday, that "the bolt" of the
                            last session was not on account of the certainty of the passage of the
                            military bill. He suggested that that bill was maneuvered in the secret
                            counsels of the opposition. He, at that session, appealed to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means to pass over that
                            bill, and let us do the pending business of pressing public importance.
                            He told the House that bill should not pass. He gave emphatic notice. If
                            they did not intend to pass that bill why was it passed to the
                            engrossment? He recited something of the severity of parliamentary
                            oppression indured by the minority in that Legislature--a motion that
                            the door be closed, and a remonstrance against it applied to the
                            doorkeeper, which could not fully be expressed in words. He regarded it
                            as the proudest period of his public service to have resisted the
                            majority of that House of Representatives, and it would have been well
                            for all the border States if the designs of unscrupulous partizans could
                            have been as successfully resisted in them.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK next took the floor. He submitted again that the Military
                            bill was not the true pretext for the bolt. He stated the duty of
                            minorities generally. They should not act with sole reference to
                            embarrassing the majority. He quoted Mr. Branham's opinion that the
                            Constitution justified the majority in bolting, pending the report of
                            the committee to wait on the Governor on the second day of that session
                            ; and with regard to the right of revolution-more than a month before
                            the Military bill was reported. Mr. Branham then claimed the right of
                            revolution in its broadest sense. He also read from the same official
                            record [The Brevier Reports] a sketch of his own remarks at that time,
                            showing the small difference between disunionism in the South and the
                            principle by which it was sought to justify the Republican bolt of the
                            last session. 
                        Mr. B. alleged that it was the inflammatory speeches of the gentleman
                            from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.] that brought about the vote ordering the
                            engrossment of the "Military Bill." The majority were not to be
                            intimidated by the gentleman. It was well known that that bill was voted
                            down in three caucuses, and that the Military
                                Committeerefused to report it, and Mr. Hanna had to
                            introduce it himself.
                        Mr. BRANHAM (in his seat,) why did not the majority bring back the
                            minority?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. They had not the power to restrain such a disregard of the
                            Constitution and laws. He had shown that the gentleman was an apologist
                            for bolting. When he (Mr. B.) consented to bolt, he would not justify
                            himself under the Constitution.
                        By way of answer to Mr. Griffith yesterday, be read the ten several
                            conditions on which the Republican members of the last House were
                            willing to come back to their places?, and he canvassed their character,
                            and the dishonor that would have followed on the submission of the
                            majority. A conqueror could hardly propose harder terms than did this
                            recusant minority. No wonder that their terms were rejected with scorn
                            and loathing.
                        He then showed the condition of the calendar of business at the time of
                            the bolt, in connection with the rules requiring two-thirds to take up
                            business out of order, and inferred the impossibility of the passage of
                            that Military bill-151 bills on the Speaker's table, having precedence
                            of that bill.
                        Mr. KILGORE inquired whether there was not a time early in March, when
                            the Republicans asked but one condition on which they would return?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK admitted that the gentleman did so propose, but it was not in
                            writing, and considered too late by the caucus, and that proposition
                            also placed the majority at the mercy of the minority. Those interviews
                            were regarded somewhat in the light of the attempted negation up there
                            at Niagara Falls.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said hereafter he should insist on the
                            enforcement of the 31st rule. No member shall speak twice without leave.
                            He denied that there was any issue before the people with reference to
                            that previous Military bill. He stated what were the issues of 1862. The
                            Democrats succeeded that year, because they would have a more vigorous
                            prosecution of the war. The difficulty with the last House of
                            Representatives was that they endeavored to make issues, instead of
                            carrying out the decisions of the people. He denounced the last
                            Legislature, and especially the Military bill, the climax of its
                            absurdity, and disregard of the Constitution. He then recited the issues
                            of the canvass of 1864, especially the bolting question, and the
                            executive acts of Governor Morton, and the Republicans were sustained by
                            a triumphant majority. He justified his bolting on the ground that it
                            was taken with the motive to counteract and resist the tendencies to
                            revolution.
                        In conclusion, I will say to gentlemen of the other side, oppose this
                            bill as bitterly as you please-defeat it if you can-but before-you cast
                            that dishonor upon the State of Indiana, for God's sake, by some act of
                            yours, blot  out her proud record
                            in this war for the preservation of the Union. Ignore your association
                            and connection with the brave sons of the Hoosier State, whose blood has
                            reddened every battle-field, from Gettysburg to the Rio del Norte. Tear
                            from the flags deposited in the tender keeping of the State, to
                            perpetuate the valor of her sons, the names of the sanguinary fields
                            upon which they have vindicated and sustained the proud name of Indiana,
                            and which you propose to destroy by your opposition to this bill. Say to
                            the world that you have lost all sense of honor--all patriotism--all
                            regard for the men who have sacrificed their lives for the preservation
                            of the Union, and then place upon the journals of the House, if you
                            will, your votes to go down through all time to come, so that future
                            generations, when you, Mr. Speaker, and I, and all who hear me now have
                            gone down to the slient grave-when the mould shall have gathered upon
                            our memories, as it will upon our tombs, may pronounce upon your action
                            and mine in reference to this bill and the vindication of the honor of
                            the State and her patriotic dead, the verdict we respectively
                            deserve.
                        And then the House took a recess till two o'clock P. M. 
                    

                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        Mr. DUNHAM rose to a personal explanation. The other day, in debate on
                            this bill, (Mr. Prather's H. R. No. 13) the gentlemen from Delaware saw
                            proper to contradict a statement he then made. He now held in his hand
                            the Ritual of the Union League, and he desired to read with reference to
                            the truth of what he then affirmed. Article 10, page 2 of that document
                            he read:
                        "Each member of this lodge shall promptly provide himself with at least
                            one good shotgun, musket or rifle, and a sufficient supply of fixed
                            ammunition for the effective use of the same."
                        He stated also that he was misrepresented in the Indianapolis Journal in
                            the statement that "Mr. Dunham defended the order in its acts,"
                            referring to the Sons of Liberty. So far from justifying that order, he
                            had constantly and earnestly condemned all secret political orders and
                            associations.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB had not seen the article referred in the Journal--certainly
                            he did not write it. But he understood the gentleman to justify their
                            arming.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. The whole history of his life was a testimony against bearing
                            arms secretly about the person.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted a motion to refer the bill and amendments to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the fourth section by adding these words to
                            the end of the section:
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    "And shall as soon as their labors are completed, report
                                        their proceedings and the facts upon which each claim is
                                        founded, to the "Revisory Board," separating said claims
                                        into the following classes:
                                    
                                         Claims for property taken, destroyed, or
                                            injured by rebels.
                                         Claims for property taken, destroyed, or
                                            injured by Union forces under the command of U. S.
                                            officers.
                                         Claims for property taken, destroyed, or
                                            injured by Union forces not under the command of United
                                            States officers, with a statement showing specifically
                                            in each case under what circumstances, and by what
                                            authority, such property was so taken, injured and
                                            destroyed.
                                         Each claimant for personal property shall prove
                                            whether the same was listed in his name in 1863, for
                                            taxation in this State and if so, whether be placed the
                                            valuation thereon; and no claimant for the loss or
                                            destruction of property so listed, and valued by
                                            himself, shall be allowed a greater sum than such
                                            valuation.
                                    
                                
                            
                        


                         Mr. BROWN. The reason why he desired this matter to go to the
                                Judiciary Committee was this: If the amendment of
                            the gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange be adopted, there will have to
                            be two Commissions appointed one to inquire into the legality of the
                            claims and the other to inquire whether the person to whom the claim, is
                            owing is loyal or disloyal, He disputed the power of a commission to sit
                            on such a grave question, &c.
                        The motion was agreed to.

                        
                            WINSLOW, LANIER & CO.
                            On motion by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, the regular order of business
                                was suspended, and the House took up the bill [S. No. 49,] to repay Winslow,
                                Lanier & Co.
                            The question pending being on the adoption of Mr. Brown's amendment. 
                            Mr. WRIGHT having the floor, recited the history of the State debt.
                                The faith of the State was pledged for the interest. It was the
                                opinion of eminent, lawyers that, if the State failed in paying this
                                interest, her creditors might come back for the original amount of
                                the debt. He also adverted in deprecating terms to the course of the
                                opposition in the issues of the late election canvass, and the
                                proceedings of the last House of Representatives. When he had
                                concluded-he demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. BROWN desired the floor.
                            Mr. DUNHAM desired to offer an amendment, to be read for
                                information.
                            Mr. WRIGHT adhered to the demand, and there was a second affirmative
                                38. negative 35.
                            Mr. BROWN and Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays on the
                                question, Shall the main question be ordered, which being
                                taken resulted-yesas 48, nays 37 so the main
                                question, viz: Shall Mr. Brown's amendment be adopted, was ordered
                                to be put; and the yeas and nays having been ordered thereon, and
                                being taken, resulted-yeas 33, nays 52, as follows.

                                            Chambers, Church, Cox, Crook, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke,
                                            Goodman, Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren,
                                            Griffith, Groves, Henricks, Hershey, Higgins, Hogate,
                                            Hoover, Johnson, Kilgore, Major, Meredith, Miller, of
                                            Tippecanoe, Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb, Olleman,
                                            Prather, Reese, Rhodes, Rice, Riford, Sabin, Shuey, Sim,
                                            Stewart, Stringer, Sullivan, of Posey and Vanderburg,
                                            Trusler, Upson, Welch, White, Whiteside, Willis,
                                            Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zigler and Mr. Speaker-52.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the amendment was rejected, and the question recurred on ordering
                                the bill to be engrossed.
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM desired to propose an amendment and moved to refer the
                                bill and amendment to the Committee on Claims.
                            
                            The SPEAKER explained the order, ruling out the amendment. 
                            Mr. BROWN, Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. BUSKIRK insisted that the bill was
                                still being considered on the second reading.
                            The SPEAKER. The main question on Saturday was simply on the
                                amendment; but to-day when the bill may be passed the third reading
                                there was another vote beyond the Amendment, viz, the ordering the
                                bill to the third reading, and that question is reached by the
                                operation of the previous question. Authorities were presented.
                            The bill was then ordered to the third reading and read the third
                                time by the Clerk.
                            Mr. DUNHAM now moved his amendment again, with the motion to refer
                                the bill to the Committee on Claims with special
                                instructions.
                             Th'e SPEAKER held that the previous question carried the bill
                                through to the title.
                            Mr. DURHAM and Mr. BUSKIRK argued that the force of the previous
                                question was exhausted in the vote ordering the bill to be read the
                                third time. That there was now another question beyond the ordering
                                to the third reading, not under the operation of the previous
                                question, namely: "Shall the bill pass?" and that the amendment was
                                in order.
                            Mr. PUETT insisted that we could discuss the merits of the bill on
                                its passage; and if so there was no force remaining in the previous
                                question.
                            Mr. DUNHAM insisted that there was a necessary implication for the
                                admission of his amendment by way of reference with special
                                instructions, in the latter clause of the 59th rule. His motion
                                would be to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                    Claims with instructions to strike out in lines eight
                                and nine these words: ''From the date of the deposit to meet skid
                                interest to the time of payment" and insert in lieu these words: *
                                "from the time of payment of interest paid by them until the time of
                                deposit with them by the Treasurer of State in November, 1864."
                            Voices. ''Object."
                            Mr. BRANHAM demanded the previous question; and there was a second,
                                by the House.
                             Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. BROWN made the point: If the Chair hold the
                                bill under the operation of the previous question, how does the
                                Chair entertain a motion by the gentleman from Jefferson for the
                                previous question?
                            The SPEAKER overruled the point. 
                            
                            And so the main question was ordered, and the bill put on its final
                                passage, the vote resulting--yeas 52, nays 33--as follows:

                            Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, (when his name was called,) explained that while
                                he was willing to pay all just,and legal debts of the State, he was
                                not convinced that the bill in its present shape should meet his
                                approbation; and therefore he voted "No."
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                            Mr. BROWN desired unanimous consent to offer a resolution for
                                allowing Messrs. Glazebrook and Milroy $30 for expenses incurred by
                                them for carrying home the remains of the late Mr. Shaffer.
                            Mr. HENRICKS objected.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK desired unanimous consent to present a claim of Morrison
                                and Ray.
                            Mr. DUNHAM objected.
                            Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay the
                                motion en the table.

                            
                            Mr. BROWN demanding the yeas and nays, they were ordered, and being
                                taken, the vote was reported--yeas 56, nays 27.
                            So the bill was finally passed the House of Representative beyond
                                reconsideration.
                        


                        
                            SENATE BILLS.
                            The SPEAKER announced the regular order, the consideration of
                                messages and bills from, the Senate.

                            Were severally passed the first reading.
                            The joint resolution [S. No.
                                    5] affecting certain persons therein named on the United
                                States pension roll, was ordered to the third reading. 
                        
                        
                            PER DIEM OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH'S bill [H. R. No. 4] fixing the per diem and milage of
                                members of the General Assembly, and providing officers therefor,
                                &c., coming up in order, with the amendment of the
                                    Committee on Fees and Salaries, proposing to
                                strike out the 2d and 3d sections.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH explained the provisions of the bill, showed wherein it
                                proposes to amend the general statute, page 356, and urged
                                considerations against the adoption of the amendment.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK preferred to retain these sections.
                            Mr. MAJOR. It was thought by the committee that the constitutional
                                provieion was sufficiently explicit as to officers of the General
                                Assembly.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. The Constitution prescribes that each House shall elect
                                its own officers, and the laws prescribe what the offices shall
                                be.
                            
                             Mr. BRANHAM. It was a law that would never be observed; but the
                                committee objected chiefly to the compensation and the authority of
                                the principals to appoint assistants, beyond the control of the
                                House.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH. He did not understand that the bill gave the privilege
                                of the appointments of assistants beyond the control of the House.
                                He observed also that the committee did not recommend the passage of
                                the bill.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend further by inserting appropriately,
                                these words after the words "shall appoint their assistants,"
                                "except the pages, who shall be appointed by the President of the
                                Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives."
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            Mr. KILGORE proposed to amend by making the compensation of Clerks
                                and Door-keepers "$5" instead of "$4,"
                            It was rejected.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed an amendment to obviate the objection of Mr.
                                Branham, by appropriately inserting these words: "If their
                                respective houses permit."
                            It was agreed to.
                            Mr. HENRICKS proposed an amendment byway of substitute, playing upon
                                the fact of the hundred dollars appropriation to each member for
                                newspapers and postage, as a precedent for each successive General
                                Assembly voting its own pay.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved to reject it.
                            Mr. HENRICKS withdrew it.
                            Mr. HIGGINS proposed to amend, by striking out all that part of the
                                bill relating to the compensation, of officers;
                            Which was agreed to.
                            And then, on motion of Mr. GRIFFITH, it was referred to a Select
                                Committee of Five.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK now asked and obtained leave to present the claim
                                heretofore indicated by him, and it was referred to the
                                    Committee on Claims.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB had leave to present a memorial from the same parties,
                                and it took the same reference.
                        


                        
                            ELEVENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE, from the Committee on the
                                Judiciary, obtained unanimous consent to report back Mr.
                                Coffroth's bill [H. R. No.
                                    46,] fixing the times of courts in the 11th Judicial
                                Circuit, with an amendment.
                            Mr. COFFROTH asked the indulgence of the House to consider the bill
                                now.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK objected, in order to get up his amendment of the Rules,
                                but failing in that, he withdraw his objection.
                            On the motion of Mr. WHITESIDE, the order of business was suspended,
                                and Mr. Coffroth's bill was taken up.
                            The amendment of the Committee was concurred in.
                            Mr. LASSELLE. This bill was simply reversing the order; of the Courts
                                in this Circuit. He should vote against the bill unless good and
                                sufficient reasons be given for the changes.
                            Mr. COFFROTH said the changes proposed met the approbation of the
                                Judge; and they were desirable for other reasons which he recited. 
                            Mr. WHITESIDE gave further reasons for the proposed change of
                                times.
                            Mr. LASSELLE did not think the public interest required the proposed
                                changes.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE again urged the passage of the bill.
                            
                            The bill was then passed the third and last reading in the House of
                                Representatives-yeas 91, nays 5.
                            The Senate concurrent resolution to raise a flag on the dome of the
                                Capitol was considered and adopted.
                            The Senate concurrent resolutions, embracing a memorial to Congress
                                relative to the discharge of troops recruited to fill up old
                                regiments at the time of the discharge or expiration of the term of
                                enlistment of the soldiers of such old regiments, (printed at length
                                on pages 54 and 55 of these Reports,) coming up-
                            It was adopted without a division. 
                            On motion of Mr. MILROY, (at 5:15) the House adjourned till to-morrow
                                morning at nine o'clock.

                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the special committee of one from each
                            Congressional District, to which was referred the Mr. Culver's College
                            bill [S. 81] introduced yesterday, viz: Messrs. Beeson, Van Buskirk,

                            Richmond.
                        Also, the select committee of one from each Judicial District, to which

                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication from Hon.
                            M. L. Brett, Treasurer of State (in answer to Senate resolution adopted
                            day before yesterday) embracing a statement showing the dates and
                            amounts of all deposits made by him with Winslow, Lanier & Co.,
                            together with copies of receipts and the correspondence connected
                            therewith, which he trusted would be a satisfactory reply to the inquiry
                            made in the resolution.
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER the communication was laid on the table and 500
                            copies ordered printed for the use of the Senate.

                            suppress places of public drinking ; which was referred to the

                            fact that they are deprived of the enjoyment of rights dear to all men,
                            viz: the right of suffrage and of a participation in the benefits
                            arising from the common school fund, and praying the Legislature, in the
                            name of our holy religion, of humanity, and of justice, to enact laws
                            repealing these disabilities.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. The deprivation of these rights is a sore thing. Our
                            colored citizens are denied the privilege of appearing in our courts of
                            justice because they have a black skin; and these sable children have no
                            power in their own hands to protect their hearthstones. It is a most
                            grievous sin that we will send our missionaries across the sea to
                            convert the heathen, but we let this people grow up amongst us without
                            education, and in the most vicious manner. Just respect for our
                            character require us to sweep these obnoxious laws from our statute
                            books.
                        The petition was referred to the Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges of the Inhabitants of the State.
                    
                    
                        COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the Senate resolved itself into a
                                Committee of the WholeMr. Dunting: in the
                            chair--for the consideration of the Governor's massage.

                            iniquitous practice has grown up in some parts of the State under
                            section 349 of the Practice Act, as the same has heretofore stood.
                            Agencies are established in New York and other Eastern cities, which
                            advertise to procure divorces for any parties desiring the same, whether
                            cause therefor exist or not. these agencies have lawyers in this State
                            to whom they send the cases, at the same time forging the name of the
                            defendant to a written retainer, which, with a fee, they send to another
                            attorney, in the entire confidence of the thing. These two attorneys
                            enter our courts, procure the referment of the case to a third attorney,
                            also in the confidence of the matter, who has his fee in the case, and
                            who reports in favor of a divorce without ever receiving or examining
                            any evidence in the case whatever. All this proceeding is fraudulently
                            pro-cured by those divorce agencies. Upon this report of the referee, it
                            would seem, the courts have no discretion but to grant the divorce. Thus
                            hundreds of divorces have been heretofore procured in the courts of this
                            State annually by non-residents, and in no case have the defendants
                            probably been aware of the fact until long after the same are procured. 
                        
                        The bill was passed by yeas 44, nays 0. 
                        
                        Mr. Bonham's [25,] amending section 1 of the act prescribing certain
                            misdemeanors punishable only by Justices of the Peace, so it shall read
                            "every person who shall in a rude, insolent or angry manner strike at,
                            or otherwise place in jeopardy the person of another, shall be deeemed
                            guilty of an assault, and upon conviction, shall be fined not to exceed
                            three dollars," was read the third time and passed by yeas 44, nay
                            1.

                        SENATE JOINT RESOLUTIONS PASSED.
                        
                        Mr. Beeson's joint resolution [2], amending article viii of the

                         STATE AUDITOR.
                         The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication from the
                            Auditor of State, transmitting an additional report from the Sinking
                            Fund Commissioners, which referred to the Committee on
                                Finance.
                    
                    

                    
                         WRAPPING PAPER.
                        Mr. BENNETT offered the following, which was adopted :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper of the
                                        Senate be directed to procure sufficient wrapping paper
                                        whenever the same can be had, for the use of the Senate.
                                
                            
                        
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    

                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        WEDNESDAY January 25, 1865.
                    
                     The House met at 9 o'clock A. M. The journal of yesterday having been
                        read-


                    
                         CORRECTION OF THE JOURNAL.
                        The SPEAKER said the journal of Wednesday last did not show the adoption
                            of Mr. Branham's amendment of the Rule 55"Provided, that revenue and
                            appropriation bills, first of the House, and next of the Senate, shall
                            have preference, except unfinished business." It would be amended.
                        Mr. STIVERS and Mr. LOCKHART asked and obtained leave to record their
                            votes in the affirmative, on the final passage of the Interest bill [S.
                            49,] yesterday.
                        Mr. SPENCER, Mr. Barton, Mr. Humphreys and Mr. Howard obtained leave to
                            record their votes in the negative.
                        Mr. PRATHER presented a memorial for a claim, which was referred without
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        RULES 58, 59.
                        Mr. HENRICKS now moved to take up his motion, of which, he gave notice
                            yesterday, to amend the 58th and 59th rules, so as to admit of the
                            reference of bills on the first reading, and of the submission of
                            amendments before the several committees of the House.
                        Mr. H. stated that the object was to facilitate business.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was opposed to the proposed change; that a bill shall be
                            referred when it is not open to debate; and that when a member wishes to
                            amend a bill he must hunt up the committee. He did not like the
                            proposition, and could not see the reason for if, unless it was
                            determined to make slaughter housesof all the committee rooms. He wanted
                            to make his record as he went along. He gave other considerations going
                            to show that such a rule would lead to interminable confusion.
                        Mr. BRANHAM thought the objection not well taken. If bills were
                            referrable on the first reading, it would relieve our files at once. The
                            record of gentlemen could be made as well under the amended rule is
                            now.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH thought the proposition simply ridiculous. Every bill would
                            be subject to the caprice of the committee. It would make them compete
                            slaughterers.
                        
                        The proposed amendment was rejected on a division-affirmative 26,
                            negative 49.
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED.

                        Mr. MEREDITH introduced a bill [H. R. 82] for an act concerning the
                            creation of corporations for maintaining high schools in this State, and
                            for maintaining such corporations.
                        Mr. HOOVER introduced a bill [H. R. 83] for an act to amend the 331
                            section of the act to repeal all general laws in force for the
                            incorporation of cities, &c., approved March 9, 1857.
                        Mr. RHOADS introduced a bill [H. R. 84] for an act to legalize the action
                            of the Board cf County Commissioners of Vermillion county, and of the
                            Board of Equalization, &c.
                        Mr. COLOYER introduced a bill [H.R. 85] for an act to amend the 17th
                            section of the act containing several provisions concerning landlords,
                            tenants and lessees, approved May 20, 1862.
                        Which bills were severally passed to the second reading.
                    


                    
                        GRAND RAPIDS AND INDIANA RAILROAD.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH introduced a joint resolution [H. R. No. 12] instructing our
                            Senators and requesting our Representatives in Congress on behalf of the
                            Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad Company--for extending time to said
                            railroad company to enable them'to complete their road--[five years from
                            June 3, 1856;] which was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        Mr. GRIFFITH moved to suspend the constitutional restriction requiring
                            propositions to be read on three several days, to enable him to move the
                            second reading, of his resolution now--the yeas and nays thereon
                            resulting--yeas 78, nays 7. So, two-thirds voting in the affirmative,
                            the restriction was suspended: and then--
                        On motion of Mr. GRIFFITH, the joint resolution was read the second time,
                            and ordered to be engrossed.
                    

                    
                        MR. SHAFFER'S FUNERAL.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted a resolution for allowing Messrs. Glasebrook and
                            Milroy $30 for expenses incurred by them in conveying to his home the
                            remains of the late Mr. Shaffer.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB it was referred to the Committee on
                                Ways and Means.
                        Mr. MILROY desired to offer a resolution.
                        But objection being made, the SPEAKER, (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,)
                            suggested that the time for new propositions had expired.
                    



                    
                        COUNTY WAR BONDS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to suspend the order of business and take up the
                                Judiciary Committee's bill, [H. R. 70,] to
                            authorize the several counties and cities to pay bounties to men
                            enlisting in the service--the army and navy of the United States-to
                            contract debts and levy taxes to pay them, &c.
                        Mr. BROWN called for a division of the question. The first part of the
                            motion being to suspend the rule.
                        The SPEAKER ruled the demand out of order.
                        The bill was taken up.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was read the second time by the Clerk.
                        The main features of the bill are as follows:
                        
                            
                             No county or city is permitted to pay more than $300 for
                                volunteers.
                             A city cannot add its bounty to that paid by the county,
                                but when a city pays a bounty, it is to receive no benefit from the
                                county appropriation, and it is not to be taxed to pay its county
                                debt, which is to be levied on the residue of the county, but when a
                                city pays no separate bounty it will participate in the county fund
                                and taxation.
                             To procure money to pay bounties, counties and cities are
                                authorized to sell their bonds 
                                at not less than par, running not more than twenty nor less than
                                five years, which bonds are to bear interest at the rate of six per
                                cent.
                             An annual tax is required to be levied sufficient to pay
                                the interest and not less than five per cent, of the principal; and
                                if the tax for the extinguishing of the principal cannot, before the
                                expiration of the first five years, be invested in the bonds at or
                                below their par value, the bill authorizes it to be loaned on real
                                estate security of not less than twice the value of the loan, or to
                                be temporarily invested in the public debt of this State.
                        
                        Mr. COFFROTH said, if the war goes on, these local bounties might so
                            increase the burdens of taxation as to drive the people from the State.
                            The bill was unnecessary. The act of Congress was sufficient for
                            recruiting the army. In the beginning of the war men went into the army
                            without these extra bounties. He suggested a motion to refer the bill to
                            the Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to
                            amend it so as to prohibit local bounties altogether. And it would be
                            unjust to thus distinguish in favor of recruits, and against those who
                            had served since the war began.
                        Mr. KILGORE also opposed the bill. The veterans of the army were of the
                            class just mentioned, and they went into the army for $13 a month. We
                            never heard of bounties till the drafts came. The bill was unjust toward
                            the veterans. There were numerous reasons why the bill should not pass.
                            He submitted a few. At the time of the last draft, in Delaware county
                            the people went to work to fill their township quotas. And in some
                            townships they not only supplied their quotas, but in Monroe, Salem and
                            Mt. Pleasant townships they stand, respectively, 14, 12 and 10 men ahead
                            of that call-these men costing the people, by voluntary contributions,
                            $300 per man. The bill proposed to tax all alike, and it was easy to see
                            how its operation would be unjust to the liberal citizens of those
                            townships. It would tax equally those who had given their sons to the
                            war, and those who had supplied neither men nor means. He wag speaking
                            perhaps in opposition to the views of the majority in his county, but he
                            could not refrain from the dictates of public duty.
                        He gave further illustrations. Already the township of Muncie had raised
                            their volunteers' bounties to $300. Let this bill pass, and the $300
                            proposed to be offered under it by the county commissioners would make
                            the Muncie bounty $600; whilst in other townships of Delaware county
                            they would get but the county bounty of $300. The bill would throw the
                            burden of the war upon the poor, laboring married men of the country,
                            most needed at home. In like manner, Indianapolis would give $400, and
                            Richmond $500 local bounties.
                         He opposed the bill for other reasons. It could not exempt the soldier
                            now in service from taxation. It taxes him to shield the idlers and
                            cowards about town from, the draft. The Constitution prohibited the
                            Legislature from discriminating. It was not only unjust to the
                            tax-payers, but to the soldiers and their families, who have been
                            diligently serving and suffering for their country.
                        Mr. BROWN, If he had made the speech of the gentleman from Delaware, he
                            would feel himself liable to arrest. He took not his position on this
                            bill for popularity. So far as the people of his county were concerned,
                            its patriotism and devotion to the country needed no vindication : they
                            had supplied their quotas, and they did not owe a dollar of war
                            debt.
                        He adverted to the fact of the ready enlistments of men to fill up the
                            army at the beginning of the war-the grandest the world ever saw. But
                            perhaps the change of administrative policy had damped the ardor for
                            enlistment. He preferred that the State should furnish the men called
                            for by the President of the United States. He doubted whether the bill
                            would establish a uniform bounty system. The sixth section provided that
                            cities may give bounties, and the objection of the gentleman from
                            Delaware was well taken.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said there was no double bounty. Section 10 provides that
                            cities paying not exceeding $300 shall receive no benefit from the
                            county bonds.
                        Mr. KILGORE. The city is exempted from taxation with the other portions
                            of the county.
                        Mr. KILGORE. If they pay the $300.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Can't the city cut itself off from the
                            county?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, Not that he was aware of.
                        Mr. BROWN resumed. That was the point. He would pay these bounties all
                            out of the State Treasury. In this way we would save labor for
                            agriculture, and ameliorate the stern severity of the draft. Men with
                            helpless families would be the sufferers under the bill. We should lay
                            down that course that would raise volunteers and relive the heavy
                            pressure of the draft. As a State, whether we believe the war policy
                            right or wrong, it is our bounden duty to obey the call for men. He had
                            no private or partisan feeling in this question.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB thought a more full exposition of the bill was necessary. He
                            pressed its passage to obviate some of the evils complained of here. He
                            wished to make the burden uniform and repress prodigality. He referred
                            to the course of the city authorities of Indianapolis-compelled to take
                            the course they had taken, because they were out-bid by other places.
                            The recruit was credited wherever ho pleased.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Could we not prohibit the payment of bounty to men not
                            credited to their proper places.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, Perhaps so. He recited the previsions of the bill. We had in
                            it uniformity. Counties and cities could not rival each other. And to
                            some extent we would prevent counties from running into bankruptcy. This
                            county never paid but, $100. The highest paid city and county was $200.
                            He commended that provision of the bill prohibiting county and city
                            bonds selling below par. As to the idea of a State loan for bounties, we
                            could not get the machinery in operation in time. The draft was to be
                            upon us in February. The county bonds could be got out at once. We could
                            not start the State bonds till we have a fund of four or five millions.
                            There was a bill with the Judiciary Committee to levy
                            a tax for the welfare of soldiers' families that would soon be matured.
                            He would support that bill as heavily as he did the school tax. His
                            object is  pressing this bill was
                            to avoid extravagance and prodigality. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Would not the $300 bounty, if the war continues, result in
                            bankruptcy?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB would leave that to the people. He hoped some gentleman would
                            offer the amendment suggested by the gentleman from Huntington. He would
                            not vote for it, but he would not complain.
                        He replied to the intimation that the bill would shield the idlers and
                            merchants' clerks of the town. Some of these men did not want bounties.
                            If their sons or themselves were drafted, they could buy a substituted
                            cheaper than they could pay the resulting taxes. If this bill were
                            submitted to the people the wealthy men would not vote for it; but the
                            clamor in its favor would come from the poor--the laborers and
                            mechanics. He discussed at length the hardships which it was the purpose
                            of this bill to obviate as far as may be. 
                        Mr. SIM. What bounty does the general Government pay?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. One hundred dollars for one year-- three hundred dollars for
                            three years. When he had concluded--
                        Mr. WRIGHT took the floor in opposition to the bill. The misfortunes of
                            our people were fast becoming pretest for extravagant legislation. He
                            objected to the bill because it proposed to tax the property of those in
                            the field, not to benefit themselves, but to benefit their neighbors who
                            have never seen the field of war. Then it would result in bankruptcy and
                            repudiation, and chiefly its operation would be to exempt those that
                            have never gone to war.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the bill as follows:
                        "Provide that the bounty shall be paid on the condition that the person
                            enlisting is credited to the township of his actual residence; and such
                            person shall be required to take an oath or affirmation as to his actual
                            place of residence."
                        Mr. BUSKIRK (in view of the importance of this question) moved an order
                            for an afternoon session-desiring that all having amendments to this
                            bill would present them.
                        Mr. BRANHAM thought that the better course would be to refer the bill,
                            with the pending amendments, and give the committees time to work this
                            afternoon. If the committees did not give the Committee on Ways
                                and Means their reports, that committee would not be able
                            to act.
                        Mr. DUNHAM suggested that the bill be printed.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It should be perfected first by its friends.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. There was no occasion for hurry: for it could not be passed
                            in time to benefit the people. The people were providing for themselves,
                            and we were legalizing their acts.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. That was the best reason for urgency.
                        After further consultation by Mr. BRANHAM, Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. PRATHER and
                            Mr. HARRISON-generally insisting on the most expeditious action-
                        Mr. GRIFFITH did not approve of the bill exactly. He, also, would like to
                            have a session this afternoon.
                        Mr. HIGGINS and Mr. KILGORE preferred the adjournment till to-morrow
                            morning.
                        Mr. Buskirk's order was adopted for an afternoon session.
                        Mr. PUETT submitted the following for the information of the House:
                        
                        SEC.-. That no bounty under the provisions of this
                            act, shall be paid to any recruit who shall be credited to any township
                            in any county, or any ward in any city wherein he has not resided for
                            thirty days next immediately preceding his enlistment.
                        SEC. -. That each person who shall be drafted and put
                            into the service of the United States, shall be entitled to and shall
                            receive like bounty as herein provided for volunteers."
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted the following, which was read for information:
                        
                        "Provide for the payment of a like bounty to each volunteer who has
                            heretofore volunteered and been credited to such county or city, and has
                            not received any local bounty, and to the widows and children of such as
                            have volunteered and died in the service; or in case such volunteer has
                            received less local bounty, then a sum shall be paid which shall make
                            that local bounty equal to the bounty provided by this bill."
                        Mr. SIM submitted the following, which was read for information:
                        "Strike out all after the enacting clause."
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following, which was read for information:
                        "Strike out $300, and insert $200."
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted the following, which was read for information:
                        "Provided said bounties shall be paid to all persons who have heretofore
                            enlisted in the service, and have received no bounties; and, in case of
                            their death, then to their heirs."
                        On motion by Mr. COLLINS, the House now took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 2 o'clock, P. M.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the Judiciary Committee's
                            bill [H. R. No. 70] was referred to the Committee of the Whole
                                House.
                        And on his further motion, the House resolved itself into a
                                Committee of the Whole House-Mr. HENRICKS in the
                            Chair-and took up the consideration of said bill and pending amendments. 
                        Mr. SHUEY, first obtaining the floor, said he had hoped this bill would
                            have been passed without delay. He represented the anxiety for it in his
                            region. He feared that it would be impossible to divide the burden of
                            this war equally without such a bill as this. Wealthy men would escape,
                            and the liberal-hearted and patriotic would be left to bear the burden
                            and heat of the day. It had been suggested that this and the other bill
                            to come from the Judiciary Committee would bring upon
                            the people: too heavy a burden; but he would submit to any requisite
                            burden to maintain the integrity of his country. Ha wanted equality, and
                            answered objections. Not a man in the army of the Union would complain
                            of sacrifices at home to fill up the army.
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted an amendment by way of substitute.
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK called for the reading of the bill by sections, conformably
                            to the rules regulating the House in Committee of the
                                Whole.
                        The first section having been read--
                        Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend by striking out "300" and inserting
                            "200."
                        Mr. COFFROTH now submitted an amendment, by way of substitute, as
                            follows:
                        Strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert the following:
                        "That it shall not be lawful for any county, or incorporated city, or
                            town of this State to grant or pay any bounty to any person hereafter
                            enlisting or volunteering in the military service of the United States,
                            or for the purpose of procuring any such enlistment."
                        Sec 2. Whereas, an emergency," &c.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. It was known that there was a bill coming from the
                                Judiciary Committee, providing for the relief and
                            sustenance of soldiers' families; there was also before that committee a
                            bill from the Senate legalizing the local proceedings of County
                            Commissioners for the encouragement of enlistments. The first bill fee
                            would support. He should say nothing of the latter. But the County
                            Commissioners would, as a general thing, adopt the maximum of bounty.
                            The outside pressure would constrain it. He recited a case that occurred
                            lately, where County Commissioners had been compelled to levy a tax for
                            bounties by the dictation of a mob. This bill is to fill up the quotas.
                            But the county bonds, it is provided, shall not be sold below par. How
                            could these bonds sell at par, when county bonds, in some cases which he
                            mentioned, were now selling for fifty-five cents? How then? Put them
                            into the hands of the soldiers? Then they would go at once into the
                            hands of the sharks and Shylocks, and they, and not the soldiers nor
                            their families, would get all the benefit. There was no provision to
                            prevent the soldiers from transferring them. But the principal objection
                            was in this: that it would accumulate immense county debts, piling Ossa
                            upon Pelion, till we should drive our people from the State by
                            oppressive, taxation-for a county, unlike a sovereignty could not
                            repudiate. If the war goes on, the limitation was "the last man and the
                            last dollar."
                        Mr. CHAMBERS was in favor of the bill, because the intent of it was to
                            increase the pay of the soldiers, It might be liable to abuses, but no
                            matter. He would like to see the Federal Government raise the soldiers'
                            pay to $40 a month. He admitted that men would go into the army for
                            mercenary purposes, as alleged by Mr. Kilgore; and he admitted also
                            that" we could not call out a better army than that of 1862; but we
                            could not do a better thing in that direction than to pass this bill. He
                            answered other objections. This was an act of justice evincing a desire
                            to give an equivalent for services rendered. This matter of raising
                            armies was like business in common life: bold out the proper
                            inducements, and you will get the men. The present unequal system was as
                            open to extravagance as this. Soldiers were always favorable to a just
                            compensation to soldiers.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Large bounties had developed bounty-jumpers.
                            He was for any plan that would put men into the field-men that would
                            stay when they enlisted,He would have the pay disbursed to the recruits
                            in installments-say $100 in advance, and another $100 in eight or ten
                            months. Thus we might retain the men in the field whom we send there. He
                            would recommit the bill, with instructions to amend so as to exclude all
                            inducements to bounty-jumping. He argued this at length.
                        Mr. BRANHAM coincided in the views of Mr. Miller; and, while he was of
                            opinion, that this money should come out of the State Treasury,he would
                            not be tenacious. For he put this question on the ground of simple
                            justice to the soldiers.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. There were but two ways to raise men for the
                            army-volunteering and the draft. Do gentlemen desire the draft? Then let
                            them vote against this bill. Which was preferable for the service, the
                            volunteer or the drafted man? He preferred the volunteer. We had to
                            appeal to less honorable motives now to raise men than two years ago.
                            With reference to the burden of the tax this bill would propose, which
                            was to be preferred-the honest payment of the tax, or service in the
                            field? The men staying at home ought to be taxed in such amounts as to
                            make a suitable compensation to those that serve in the field. He showed
                            the hardships in the operation of the draft.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Was it not a hardship to tax men in the field
                            equally with those at home?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK admitted that it was a hardship; but it was inevitable. The
                            constitutional provision could not be avoided. He stopped not now to
                            inquire whether this would be satisfactory to the men in the field. He
                            was most ready at all times to do them justice. He was willing to be
                            taxed to the extent of all his property to pay for the service of our
                            brave and patriotic fellow-citizens in the army. Every draft would bring
                            the pressure for taxation heavier on the County Commissioners, whose
                            acts we must legalize. Then let us regulate and control this thing by
                            law, for it was being managed without law, (as in the case recited by
                            the gentleman from Huntington,) and would be till the Legislature laid
                            its hand upon it. To a question, how bounties benefitted the army, he
                            answered that they sent out many who would not go without bounties; and
                            they would bring out for the service those who could be best spared from
                            the interests of agriculture---We ought; to regulate this by uniform
                            law, and only pay bounties to those who will take an oath, establishing
                            their place of residence.
                        Mr. GROVES could not vote for this bill, which would flood the country
                            with worthless paper. And if gentlemen would ask for the soldiers' vote
                            on this bill they would not find many yeas. If they would not to a man
                            rebuke the passage of this bill, they were not made of the stuff that
                            had volunteered from his county. No man was more truly the solder's
                            friend than he. He should vote for the bill to relieve the soldiers'
                            families, which had been promised by the Judiciary
                                Committee. He wanted to provide as well for those now in
                            the field as for those yet remaining at home and willing to go.
                        
                        Mr. SIM was conscientiously opposed to the passage of this bill, though
                            he might not be sustained in this opinion at home. He was not unwilling
                            to be taxed, but was opposed to taxation to encourage volunteering. He
                            insisted that the same inducements to volunteering existed now as at the
                            beginning. He did not himself go for bounty. He himself tried to get
                            into the three months' service as a private, where there was no bounty.
                            If he was not physically incapacited, he would volunteer to-morrow. He
                            would rather be in the army than in the Legislature. Soldiers in the
                            field would consider it invidious to pay heavy bounties to men that
                            would never see the field, for it was probable that recruits now would
                            not get out of their camp of instruction before this war would be ended.
                            He paid the tribute of speech to our heroic soldiers in the field and to
                            the President for his proclamation of freedom. He honored those who
                            fought for pay no more than the champions of the prizefighter's ring. He
                            would provide amply for the soldiers' families. As for the draft, he
                            would rather than not that it would take place.
                        Mr. HARRISON. Local bounties would be paid at all events, and it were
                            better to regulate them by law. The relief of soldiers' families did not
                            satisfy him. He would do more. He would pay for service in war. The
                            Senate bill now before the House Committee would legalize that had yet
                            been done, and this bill would come in and restrain the tendency to
                            extravagance for the future. He was in favor of Mr. Danham's
                            amendment.
                        Mr. COLLINS showed that unequal taxation would result from the operation
                            of this bill.-- Its tax upon unproductive lands would be unequal. Then
                            it was harder for the poor county to pay this tax than the rich county.
                            But the grossest inequality was in paying heavy bounties to those who
                            would not probably remain long in the service.
                        Mr. CHURCH. Bounties were inducements for men to enlist. They brought men
                            into the service, without the bad feeling incident to every
                            draft-finding fault with the enrollment, the Board of Examiners,
                            &c., charging bribery upon them and many other shades of crime. And
                            there were other evils incident to the draft, which he recited-loss of
                            property on account of debt-feigned illness-running away, and desertion.
                            The chief opposition to the bill was, that it would bankrupt the State.
                            But taxes for thin purpose would be levied by the County Commissioners.
                            And then the hardships of the draft it were more wise to avoid. As to
                            the inequality on the part of those who have pone to war without local
                            bounties, though it must be conceded, yet the families of those soldiers
                            have been sustained at home. No soldiers' family, nor widow, nor orphan
                            had suffered in this country. Then most of those that have gone to war
                            could not be said to pay very heavy taxes. He was fully instructed to
                            support this bill. Men who have been made rich by this war might
                            complain of taxation for this purpose. Let such sell some of their
                            unproductive lands, and pay their taxes, and sustain the men who protect
                            their title deeds. When a man takes the risk of his life, let him cave
                            the proper inducements to serve his country in war. No fear that such a
                            man will be over-paid. He spoke at length, defending the bill and
                            answering objections. When the outside pressure compelled county
                            commissioners to tax for bounties, assuredly we should not refrain from
                            our duty here. He was loth to sit down, because he knew his constituents
                            desired this bill.
                        Mr. BROWN, speaking to Mr. Coffroth's amendment, doubted whether it was
                            competent for the Legislature to pass a law which in its operation would
                            discourage enlistments. The policy of the war was nothing. Did the
                            country call for troops? The State must furnish them. Should we change
                            the system of volunteering to one that would drag out unwilling men by
                            the draft? How could we best serve the Government and ourselves? He
                            deprecated a public debt, Some said the act of 1861 authorized taxation
                            for this purpose. At any rate, it authorized the paying out for this
                            purpose money already in the Treasury. So the richer counties would have
                            the advantage. He submitted that the best way to do away with this
                            system of bounty speculation, would be for the Legislature to prohibit
                            local bounties, and enact a uniform bounty of $300 or $400, tax for the
                            purpose, and pay the bounties all out of the State Treasury. He spoke at
                            length, exhorting to public duty and liberality in this direction.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the Committee rise, report progress and asked to
                            be discharged from the further consideration of the bill.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH said the people of his county bad been pressing this matter
                            on his attention. He was in the beginning opposed to bounties; but not
                            to all bounties, as he was erroneously reported in the Gazette.
                            Something was necessary to stimulate men to rally round the old flag. We
                            should not be over-careful of money in a question of public duty and the
                            support of the Government. Local bounties would be offered, and this
                            bill would control and equalize them, and prevent the tendencies to
                            extravagance. He read from a letter from one of his constituents
                            advocating the bill and the principle that property should pay for its
                            own protection.
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK spoke in favor of the bill, and he supported it as the
                            best means that could be adopted to avoid the severer operation of the
                            draft. He illustrated his position with recitals'of experiences of the
                            draft in his neighborhood. He was willing to be taxed to the last
                            dollar-and,he had some of them.
                        Mr. BOYD moved that the Committee rise, and report the bill to the House,
                            and ask to be discharged from its further consideration.
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend the motion so that the Committee shall ask
                            leave to sit again.
                        The latter motion was agreed to; and the Committee rose, and the Chairman
                            reported accordingly.
                        The House concurred in the report.
                        A message from the Senate announced the passage in that body of a
                            concurrent resolution for the election of President and members of the
                            Boards of Trustees of the State Benevolent Institutions, Commissioners
                            of the Sinking  Fund and Directors
                            of the State Bank, to-morrow at two and a half o'clock, P. M.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the resolution was taken up.
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB the resolution was amended by striking out that
                            part of it which relates to the Commissioners' of the Sinking Fund.
                        And so the resolution was adopted.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Auditor of
                            State, transmitting an additional report from the Commissioners of the
                            Sinking Fund.
                        Which was referred to the Committee on the Sinking
                                Fund.
                        And then (at 5:30 P. M.) the House adjourned till to-morrow morning 9
                            o'clock.
                    
                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        THURSDAY, January 26, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M. The reading of yesterday's journal was
                        commenced, when,
                    On motion by Mr. DUNNING, its further reading was dispensed with.
                    
                        A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.
                        Mr. CORBIN moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday afternoon adopting
                            the resolution proposing to go into the election of certain officers
                            therein named, at 2 1/2 o'clock this afternoon, He made this motion in
                            order that the Senate might be lead to consider the legality of one of
                            the offices proposed to be filled. The law under which we are acting,
                            contains no authority for the election of a President of the various
                            Boards of Trustees of the Benevolent Institutions of the State. [He read
                            from the law to show that it, is unconstitutional so far as the
                            President of the Boards is concerned, that office not being expressly
                            set forth in the title of the statute.] This is an innovation on the old
                            law, which provided for Trustees, but not for a President. In 1859, the
                            law was changed; but it is the prevailing opinion of every Senator who
                            has taken the pains to inform himself, that the office is a mere
                            sinecure; and as long as it is conceded that the office is of no
                            practical benefit to these Institutions, and as there is now a bill
                            being perfected aiming to correct the errors in the present law it is
                            really our duty to lay aside any party prejudices or feelings of
                            animosities and consider this question in its true light. If this
                            officer is of no benefit why elect one? Is it to furnish a place for one
                            more partizan? We should be careful how we proceed in this matter for we
                            may get up a good deal of difficulty in consequence of the election of
                            an officer the law does not provide for.
                        Mr. BENNETT read from the second section of the statute, which would do
                            away with the objection of the Senator, if he understood his argument.
                            The law constitutes the President a member of the Board of Trustees of
                            each, although he acts as President of all the Benevolent Institutions
                            of the State.
                        Mr. CULLEN was also of the opinion that the law itself done away with the
                            constitutional objection of the gentleman. The gentleman says the office
                            of President of these various Institutions is a sinecure. There are but
                            two Trustees for each Institutions and the President of them all makes
                            the third. In case of a division in opinion as between the two Trustees,
                            the President of the Board steps in and decides the question, and,
                            consequently, the office is not a mere sinecure. He was satisfied that
                            the title of this act fully covers the ground. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, read from the decisions of the Supreme Court
                            indicating that under the constitution no law shall be valid in which
                            the principal subject is not contained or expressed in the title. The
                            question is whether the election of President of the Board is a
                            principal matter, or whether it is a matter properly connected with the
                            title of the act. The view he took was that it is one of the principal
                            objects of the act. The second section read by the Senator from Union
                            [Mr. Bennett] does not necessarily make the President one the Board of
                            Trustees. The office is distinct from the office of Trustee, and being
                            so must be embraced in the title of the act in order that the section
                            providing for it shall be constitutional. Inasmuch as it is not embraced
                            in the title he thought the position taken by the Senator from Marshall
                            [Mr. Corbin] was very well taken. As this objection comes from the
                            Democratic side of the House, he trusted Senators would not regard it as
                            a Democratic persecution of a Republican official. It is nothing of the
                            kind. We came here to discuss this matter without any political feeling.
                            We desire to do only that which is best for these benevolent
                            institutions which do honor to the State. If this law does not clearly
                            embrace the election of a President of the Board of Trustees it is the
                            duty of this Senate not to elect that officer.
                        Mr. OYLER, while reciprocating the feeling that seems to actuate the
                            gentleman from Wells, differed with him as to the duty of the Senate.
                            The gentleman says he approaches this question not with the feelings of
                            a partizan. That is the spirit in which we ought all, as representatives
                            of the people, to discuss questions upon this floor. It is said that
                            great men differ in opinion, and it was his experience that even small
                            men would differ in opinion. He could not read this act as the honorable
                            Senator from Wells reads it. And it is astonish that this is the first
                            time this question has been raised in the Senate. It is strange that he
                            should hare no intimation of this until after both Houses had determined
                            to go into the election. Certainly no Senator can come to any other
                            conclusion but that the spirit, and intention and purpose of this act
                            would authorize the mode which we have determined to adopt. The
                            decisions of the Supreme Court are entitled to our attention, but with
                            all due deference to the Supreme Court, he took it that when we came up
                            here as members of the Legislature, we are not absolutely bound by the
                            decisions of the Supreme Court. We are sworn to support the
                            Constitution, and it is our duty to our country and to God, that we
                            should let that oath guide us in every vote we give. Whether we view the
                            President of the Board as one of the Trustees, or as a constituent part
                            of the Board for the government of the institutions, it follows that it
                            is in the title and constitutional, and therefore, we are pursuing the
                            proper course. 
                        
                        Mr. CORBIN withdrew his motion.
                    
                    
                         ELECTION OF TRUSTEES OF THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS,
                            AND BANK DIRECTOR.
                        A message announced that the House had concurred in the Senate resolution
                            of yesterday afternoon, proposing the election of certain oficers

                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING the Senate concurred in this resolution from the
                            House.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of Senate bills numbered 24,
                            (see page 38 of these Reports,) 30, (page 44,) 60, 62, (p 63,) 65, (p. 85,) 77, (p. 96.) and
                            80, (p. 101,) that 79, (p. 96) lie on the table, and that new matter be
                            substituted for 70, (p. 85 )
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the bill S. 30 was laid on the table

                        LEAVES OF ABSENCE
                        Were obtained for Messrs. Marshall, Davis and Richmond till Tuesday. 
                    
                    

                    
                        GENERAL SHERMAN'S ARMY.
                         Mr. PEDEN introduced a joint resolution [S. 13) tendering a vote of
                            thanks to Major General Sherman, his officers and men for brilliant
                            victories gained in the campaigns of 1864 which was read the first
                            time.
                        Mr. BENNETT moved that the joint resolution be read by title only, in
                            order that it may be referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs. He fully concurred in every word con tainted in
                            the resolution, but if he had read the history of 1864 aright, Gen.
                            Sherman's is no the only army that hag won brilliant achievements. Other
                            armies have shown equal bravery, and he would like it referred to some
                            appropriate committee in order that such an amendment may be made. If we
                            undertake anything of this kind, it is just as important to other armies
                            as to Sherman's.
                         Mr. PEDEN did not desire to be understock as claiming for Gen Sherman
                            all the glory, but offered the resolution simply because he happened to
                            have acted with that part of our armies. Not wishing to detract from any
                            other army corps, he mentioned Gen. Sherman's alone, that other
                            gentlemen on this floor might have the privilege of claiming a little
                            glory in a like manner for that part of the army to which they severally
                            belonged. He bad no objection to the amendments proposed, and had
                            offered the resolution in the shape it was out of courtesy, as already
                            intimated to other military gentlemen on this floor.
                        Mr. OYLER recognizing the distinguished services of the General named in
                            the resolution, thought it absolutely necessary, as we are not making
                            history but perpetuating it, that we should tell all the truth. And with
                            all due deference to the gentleman from Henry (Mr. Peden,) he had left
                            out of the enumeration in his resolution several very important
                            victories of the army under General Sherman, ''All of which I saw and
                            part of which I was." [Laughter ] He thought it necessary that the
                            resolution should be referred.
                        Mr. CORBIN. The names of gallant men who followed John Morgan, when on
                            his raid through this State, have been left out [Continued
                            laughter.]
                        The motion (Mr. Bennett's) was agreed to.
                         The joint resolution was read by title only, and referred to the
                                Committee of Military Affairs.
                    
                    
                         JOINT CONVENTION.
                        A message announced that the House of Representatives was ready to join
                            the Senate in convention for the election of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners.
                        Senators thereupon proceeded to the Hall of the House.
                        When the Senate returned-
                        Mr. MOORE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                    

                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading:

                        A message announced that the House had chosen E. W. H. Ellis a Bank
                            Director, and requested the concurrence of the Senate therein,
                        On motion of Mr. DUNNING the Senate concurred in this action of the
                            House.
                        And the Senate adjourned.
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        THURSDAY, January 26 1865.
                    
                     The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed a call of the
                        roll by the Clerk, which proceeded till a quorum was ascertained to be
                        present and within the bar of the House.
                     The journal of yesterday was read.
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.

                            referred to the Committee on Education.

                        INTRODUCTION OF BILLS.
                        Mr. WOODS introduced a bill [H.R. No. 86,] for an act to authorize the
                            digging of a ditch or canal from the Little Calumet river to the Grand

                        Mr. HUMPHREYS introduced a bill [H. R. No. 87.] for an act to amend the
                            first section of he act to amend the General Practice act of June 18,

                        Which bills were passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                        COMMON PLEAS.
                        Mr. PRATHER submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, An additional expense is incurred
                                        by he people of the State, in consequence of our Common
                                        Pleas Courts of over $200,000 per annum, which mount would
                                        be saved by abolishing those courts and transferring the
                                        business thereof to the Circuit courts; therefore
                                    Resolved, That a committee of one from each
                                        Judicial District be appointed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of abolishing said courts and transferring their
                                        business to the Circuit Courts, and increasing the
                                        compensation of Circuit Judges, end report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BROWN thought it should go to the special Committee on courts. He was
                            opposed to select and special committees doing business of regular
                            committees of the House. He moved to so amend the resolution.
                        Mr. PRATHER had but this objection: He would like for this resolution to
                            go into the hands of its friends. He was satisfied that the people of
                            the State demanded that that  shall
                            exist no longer. The business would be better done by the Circuit
                            Courts. 
                        Mr. RHOADS moved to refer it to the special Committee already ordered to
                            be appointed on that subject.
                        Mr. COFFROTH preferred a special Committee; but did not think such a
                            committee had been appointed.
                         Mr. SPENCER preferred Mr. Brown's motion.
                        Mr. Brown's motion (having precedence) was first taken; and it was
                            rejected.
                        The resolution was then referred to the special Committee. 
                    


                    
                         AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
                         Mr. HIGGINS gave notice, that to-morrow he would move to amend the first
                            rule of the House of Representatives, by adding these words: "Unless by
                            a vote of the House the reading of the journal be dispensed with."
                    

                    
                        LEGISLATIVE EXPENSES.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK rose to a question of privilege: He found on examination that
                            he had but just 35 cents in his pocket, and moved that the order of
                            business be dispensed with, and that the House take up the consideration
                            of the Senate bill No. 1, for Legislative expenses.
                         The SPEAKER. It was not a question of privilege.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK. Only so far as to gain the attention of the House.
                         Mr. BRANHAM opposed the motion, insisting on relieving the soldiers
                            first.
                        
                         The motion was rejected on a divison--affirmative 40, negative
                            32--two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.

                                    WHEREAS, In these times of high prices,
                                        men in county offices are complaining that their salaries
                                        are too low; therefore,
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Fees and Salaries be requested to take this
                                        matter into consideration, and inquire whether or not the
                                        salaries of county officers should be raised, and report by
                                        bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    

                    
                         BILLS INTRODUCED.
                         Mr. HERSHEY introduced a bill [H. R. 88] for an act to authorize high
                            schools, academies, colleges, universities, theological institutions,
                            seminaries, and missionary boards formed under the laws of this State to

                        Mr. RHOADS introduced a bill [H. R. No. 90] for an act to amend the 3d
                            section of the act regulating the docket fees of the District Attorneys
                            of the Common Pleas, and before Justices of the Peace, fixing said
                            attorney's salaries, &c., approved June 4,1861.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, introduced a bill [H. R. 91,] for an act to
                            direct the discharge of bonds given by foreign executors and guardians,

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Roads and Highways be instructed to inquire
                                        into the expediency of reporting a bill authorizing County
                                        Boards to make appropriations to open, build and repair
                                        roads and highways.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was referred to the Committee on Roads and
                            Highways.

                    
                    
                        HOUSE OF CORRECTION.
                        Mr. WRIGHT submitted the following: 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Southern Prison be instructed to inquire
                                        into the expediency and propriety of converting the Northern
                                        Prison into a House of Correction, and report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. CHURCH moved that it be referred to the Committee on the
                                State Prison North.
                        Mr. WRIGHT was informed that there were 250 empty cells in, the Southern
                            prison; and that they were asking for a large appropriation for the
                            Northern Prison.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. It was a matter that strictly interests the State Prison
                            North. There were many questions connected with the suggestion in the
                            resolution, which upon investigation might show that the object sought
                            is not expedient. He suggested a special committee.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. By means of a house of correction, there were many young
                            persons guilty of small offenses, whom the State might reform and save
                            from the disgrace and destruction, of the companionship of penitentiary
                            convicts. He did not object very strenuously to a special committee.
                        Mr. HIGGINS thought there were good reasons why the project should not be
                            adopted. The labor of the prisoners in the Northern Prison was leased
                            for seventy cents a day, while the pay for Southern prison labor was but
                            forty cents a day.
                        It was referred to a Select Committee of Five.
                    
                    
                        PROCEEDINGS OF COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. BOYD submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That each of the committees of
                                        this House be requested to keep a record of their
                                        proceedings; and that the said records be filed in the State
                                        Library, to be kept by the Librarian as part of the
                                        proceedings of this House.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                    
                    
                        EXECUTIVE REPORTS.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That His Excellency, the
                                        Governor, be requested to lay before this House the annual
                                        reports of the Auditor and Treasurer of State, together with
                                        all reports required to be made to him, which by law he is
                                        required to present to this body.

                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                    

                    
                        LANDLORDS AND TENANTS.
                        Mr. MILROY submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                         Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire into
                                        the propriety of reporting a bill amendatory of the law
                                        relative to landlords and tenants, so as to require six
                                        months to dispossess the wife and family of any soldier
                                        enlisted or drafted in the service of the United States.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                    
                    
                    
                        PROCEEDINGS OF COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote by which Mr. Boyd's resolution
                            relative to the proceedings of committees was adopted.
                        Mr. BOYD. The committees now could find no record by which they can be
                            guided by the action of former committees. He referred specially to the
                            present embarrassment of the Committee on Claims in
                            this regard. He gave the case of a fraud of $2,000 practiced on the
                            State for want of a record to show that the claim had been rejected. The
                                Committee on Claims needed the proceedings of
                                the Claims Committee of two years ago, in the
                            examination of claims before that committee at the last session, when no
                            appropriation was made for claims. He said the present
                                Committee on Claims, of which he is Chairman,
                            intended to keep a, record, and also the Committee on Ways and
                                Means, whether his resolution was adopted or not.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, did not object to those committees keeping a
                            record. It would take a good deal of stationery to keep the records of
                            the Committee on Education. It would require a large
                            amount of extra clerical labor in matters that would hardly ever be
                            referred to. For these considerations he was opposed to the
                            resolution.
                        Mr. BRANHAM said, since he had been a member of this House the
                                Committee on Ways and Means had kept a record;
                            and these records were found very convenient and important for
                            reference.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. Would not the resolution require an extra copy to be made of
                            the proceedings in committee.
                        Mr. BRANHAM supposed not. He supposed there was no committee of the House
                            but kept some sort of a record.
                        
                        The resolution was reconsidered-affirmative 40, negative 24, and the
                            question recurred on its adoption.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS moved to amend so as to require the Committees on
                                Claims and Ways and Meansto keep a record, &c.
                        Mr. PRATHER preferred the original resolution.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH suggested a difficulty about recovering what has not been
                            recorded.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, proposed to amend the amendment by reading "all
                            committees who desire it."
                        Mr. Chambers's amendment was agreed to.
                        And then, as amended, the resolution was adopted.
                    

                    
                        COUNTY WAR BONDS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to suspend the regular order of business, to enable him
                            to make a motion to consider in Committee of the
                                Whole, the Judiciary Committee's bill,
                            H. R. No. 70.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                        On motion, by Mr. DUNHAM, the House then resolved into Committee
                                of the Whole Mr. HENRICKS in the chair and the bill was
                            taken up.
                        The CHAIRMAN stated the question to be on Mr. Coffroth's amendment by way
                            of substitute.
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted the following:
                        Strike out from the enacting clause and insert the following:

                        
                            Section 1. That there shall be paid by the State of Indiana,
                                to all volunteers and drafted men from said State a bounty of $300,
                                one-third of which shall be paid whenever the volunteer or drafted
                                man shall be mustered into the service of the United States;
                                one-third at the end of four months, and one-third at the end of
                                eight months after said muster.

                            Sec. 2. That for the purpose of paying said bounties four
                                million five hundred thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be
                                required, are hereby appropriated out of any money in the Treasury
                                not otherwise appropriated.

                             Sec. 3. That for the purpose of meeting the appropriation
                                in the preceding section made, there shall be assessed and collected
                                ten cents upon each one hundred dollars of valuation of the taxable
                                property subject to taxation in the State.

                             Sec. 6. Any officer, whether county, city, town or

                                shall be in any wise aiding or abetting in so doing, shall be
                                declared guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon due conviction thereof
                                shall be fined not less than 500 nor more than $1,000, to which may

                        The CHAIRMAN decided the amendment out of order. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the committee rise and report the bill and pending
                            amendments to the House; but gave way for
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Our action on this matter should be taken at once. As we were
                            going on, not only the State, but every county in the State, would be
                            bankrupt. The General Government want men, The only question was how to
                            get them justly. Some restrictions should be placed on counties and
                            cities--on their bounty schemes--which impoverished themselves and did
                            not supply men for the service. It was just the richer districts drawing
                            men away from the poorer districts, and so leaving a heavier quota in
                            the poorer townships. It would take the blood of the poorer and some of
                            the money of the wealthier townships. It was simply a question between
                            blood and money. Bounties should be given by the State not the counties
                            and cities; because that would be doing away this grabbing system of
                            local bounties--this huckstering speculation in humanity. Then, when
                            peace shall return, be looked forward to a career of prosperity; then
                            the State would assume all these bad debts and then the State, perhaps,
                            could successfully apply to the General Government to assume it all; so
                            that the entire burden would fall equal upon all the country. Now the
                            burdens of the Eastern States have no comparison to the burdens of the
                            agricultural and producing States of the West. If this matter were left
                            to the counties and cities, it would be almost impossible to get relief
                            from the General Government. And his chief objection to the original
                            bill was, that it would mortgage for time immemorial the property of the
                            counties beyond the hope of relief. But with his proposition was the
                            advantage of the  soundness and
                            continuing credit of the State. He referred to a court decision to the
                            effect, that these county debts were collectable to the extent
                            repeatedly selling the realty of the entire country. 
                        Mr. RICE. What right had the State to call on the United States to pay
                            this debt of Indiana when they have a similar debt?
                        Mr. DUNHAM had no better reason for his remark than the feeling of
                            gratitude for service that would rise up in the future day of our
                            national prosperity.
                         Mr. Newcomb's motion, that the committee rise, was agreed to, and
                            thereupon--
                        The committee rose and the CHAIRMAN reported the bill and amendments back
                            to the House, and asked to be discharged from their further
                            consideration.
                        The report was concurred in. 
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill and ending amendments were referred to
                            a select committee of seven. 
                    
                    
                        BILLS ON THE SECOND READING.
                        On the motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the regular order of business was further
                            suspended, ind the House took up the consideration of hills on the
                            second reading.
                        Mr. Whiteside's bill [H. R. No. 18]-service of summons on

                            19]--testimony of interested parties, amending section 2, of

                            read and referred to the Committee on the

                        Mr. Hogate's bill [No. 20,] for

                                Judiciary.
                        Mr. Wood's bill [No. 22] to legalize the sale of school lands, was
                            referred to the Committee on Education.
                        Mr. Collins's bill [No 23,] for draining lands, was referred to the
                                Committee on Swamp Lands.
                    


                    
                        AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE.
                        Mr. Rhoads's bill [No. 24] accepting the Congressional donation of lands,
                            &c., and to create the Indiana Institute of Agriculture and the
                            Mechanic Arts,-coming up-
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, proposed to amend, by way of substituting the
                            printed bill of the Senate, for the establishment of the Indiana College
                            of Agriculture.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to refer the bill and pending amendment to the
                                Committee on Education.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, preferred a Select Committee of one from each
                            Congressional District.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired the House to keep all these bills together.
                        The bill and amendment were referred to the Committee on
                                Education.
                    


                    
                         RAILROADS.
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, his bill (No. 59)-(canal companies, except the
                            Wabash and Erie, may convey property to railroads,) was taken up (out of
                            order) and read the second time by the Clerk. 
                        Mr. STEWART proposed to amend by inserting after the word "Erie," these
                            words, "and the White Water Canal.
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill and proposed amendment were referred
                            to the Committee on Railroads.

                        On motion of Mr. ABBETT, the Senate bill [6,] (a court bill, affecting Bartholomew and Jennings
                            counties, with the House Committee's amendment,) was taken up, and the
                            amendment adopted; the bill was then considered as engrossed, and passed
                            the third and last reading in the House of Representatives-yeas 85, nays
                            0.
                        Mr. COLLINS moved an order for an afternoon session. 
                        It was agreed to.
                    



                    
                         COUNTY BUSINESS.
                        On motion by Mr. BECKETT, the regular order of business was further
                            suspended, and the House took up the bill [No. 45] to legalise the act
                            of civil officers in the military service of the United States; and it
                            was read the second time by the Clerk; and on his further motion, it was
                            referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                    


                    
                         DOG LAW.
                        On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, (by unanimous consent), Mr. Shoaff of Allen's
                            bill [No. 8] for taxing dogs, was
                            taken up and read through the third time by the Clerk.
                        Mr. COLLINS proposed a clerical amendment, substituting the word "fund"
                            for "revenue," which was agreed to.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery. The sole object of the bill was to raise a
                            revenue on dogs-taxing all dogs alike. This thing was unequal. It would
                            not protect sheep.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It repeals the license clause and the authority to kill
                            dogs.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. Was it not the best we could get?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to recommit the bill to a select committee of
                            five.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, acquiesced.
                        Mr. RHOADS desired to propose an amendment.
                        The SPEAKER said it was out of order-the bill was on the third
                            reading.
                        Mr. DUNHAM said he had intended with all due respect, to appeal from that
                            decision; but after some conversation with the Chair, it was judged best
                            to amend the 53d rule so that it could not admit of diverse
                            constructions.
                        Mr. RHOADS proposed to amend the bill-striking out the words "female
                            dog," and inserting "bitch" in lieu; striking out "male" before "dog;"
                            $3 tax for the first dog, and $2 for each additional dog; $5 tax for the
                            first bitch, and $2 for each additional bitch.
                        The bill and pending amendments were referred to a Select Committee of
                            Five.
                        The House then took a recess until 2 o'clock P. M.
                    



                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and announced the
                            following special committee:
                        Special committee on the Judiciary Committee's bill
                            No. 70: Messrs. Newcomb, Bran- 
                            ham, Dunham, Brown, Church, Lasselle, and Miller of Tippecanoe.


                        
                            VERMILLION APPRAISEMENT.
                            Mr. RHOADS moved for a suspension of the rules to enable him to call
                                up his bill [No. 84] to legalize the acts of the Vermillion County
                                Commissioners, and of the District and State Boards of Equalization,
                                adopting the appraisement of 1859.
                            The motion was agreed to and the bill was taken up and read the
                                second time by the Clerk.
                            On motion of Mr. RHOADS, the bill was considered as engrossed, and
                                ordered to the third reading to-morrow.
                        



                        
                            COMMISSIONERS OF THE SINKING FUND.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB asked and obtained unanimous consent to offer a
                                concurrent resolution for a joint committee of the two houses tor
                                the election of three Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, this day at
                                the hour of 4 o'clock P. M.
                            It was adopted.
                        



                        
                            NEGRO TESTIMONY.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of Mr.
                                Foulke's.bill, [H R. 25] for an act to repeal the act to prohibit
                                evidence of Indians and persons having one-eighth or more of negro

                                parties in interest.
                             The bill having been read the second time by the Clerk-
                            
                            Mr. COFFROTH moved to lay it on the table, demanding the yeas and
                                nays.

                            Mr. BOYD (when his name was called). While he was willing to do what
                                was proper to elevate the negro race, he was not willing to place
                                them on an entire equality with white men. He voted No.
                            Mr. MEREDITH, (when his name was called,) would vote against laying
                                the bill on the table, because as prosecutor he had found cases in
                                which the existing legal disability of negroes had covered up
                                crime.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. For those of Mr. Meredith, and for two additional
                                reasons, voted no. He did not think a black man worse than a man
                                from out of the Penitentiary, &c.
                            So the House refused to lay the bill on the table.
                            
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed.
                            And the yeas and nays being demanded,ordered and taken thereon,
                                resulted-yeas 35, nays 50 as follows:

                            Mr. BOYD (explaining his vote) said he was willing to give the right
                                to testify in certain cases, but not so broadly as in the bill. The
                                motion to indefinitely postpone would carry it beyond this session,
                                and he wanted some action on the subject. Therefore he voted
                                "No."
                            Mr. GRIFFITH (explaining.) I am not in favor of negro equality in the
                                party sense. Our party have stood against it. I am not in favor of
                                giving negroes the right of holding office and voting. I want
                                justice to be done; and I conceive it quite as just to permit an
                                honest. negro to give testimony, as a dishonest and debased white
                                man.. Therefore I vote against indefinite postponement.
                            Mr. ZEIGLER. I vote "No," because I an a Dutchman; and the same
                                reason that would exclude a negro might exclude a Dutchman.
                            So the House refused to postpone the bill, and the question recurred
                                on engrossment.
                            Mr. BURNES moved to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                    Rights and Privileges; pending which motion-

                                o'clock P. M. to-morrow.
                            The motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered.
                            And then (at 4:45) the House adjourned till to-morrow 2 o'clock P.
                                M.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         FRIDAY, January 27, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The Lieutenant Governor being absent-
                    On motion by Mr. CORBIN, the Senator from Monroe, [Mr. Dunning.] was called
                        to the Chair.
                    On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the reading of yesterday's journal was
                        dispensed with.
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Recommending passage of the bill, S. 82, (see page 101 of these Reports,)
                            and that the bill S. 26, (page 38.) lie on the table, were concurred
                            in.
                    
                    
                        A RESIDENCE FOR THE GOVERNOR.
                        Mr. CARSON, from the Committee on Public Buildings,
                            returned the bill, [S. 41,]
                            authorizing the sale of the Governor's Mansion, recommending its
                            passage, with an amendment providing for the purchase by the Auditor and
                            Treasurer of State, and Calvin Fletcher, Sr., Commissioner, of a
                            permanent residence for Governors of the State, with the proceeds of the
                            sale therein authorized.
                        Mr. CORBIN moved that the bill be laid on the table and 100 copies
                            thereof printed for the use of the Senate.
                        Mr. BEESON objected to the printing as a needless expense. The bill set
                            forth in a few plain words its object; Senators knew the property well,
                            and there was not so much in it but that it could easily be
                            remembered.
                        Mr. COBB favored the motion to print. It would cost but a trifle, and the
                            bill was an important one. The Governor's residence and  lot would sell readily for $50, 000, and
                            now is the time to sell.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. We were very anxious to sell the property for the reason
                            the gentleman has suggested; there is probably no better time for its
                            sale than this. Every Governor has recommended the sale of this property
                            from Gov. Wright down, Gov. Morton excepted. He would like the property
                            sold before this Legislature rises, so that gentlemen here could be at
                            the sale and see how it sells, and probably some of them might invest.
                            He would prefer the bill put through to-morrow, and the business of
                            selling it reached as quick as possible.
                        Mr. CORBIN withdrew his motion to print.
                        Mr. DOWNEY proposed to amend by authorizing the Commissioners to rent a
                            suitable residence for the Governor till the purchase is made, or to pay
                            his Excellency-----dollars at stated periods in lieu thereof.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that he deemed the present a favorable time to sell
                            the Governor's house, and we have no longer any use for it. But, as he
                            understood the bill, it required the Commissioners to purchase another
                            houie for the Governor's residence. He did not believe that a suitable
                            house for the purpose could be bought. He thought that at a favorable
                            time we should purchase well located and ample grounds, and build a
                            residence for the Governor, as convenient and complete in all its
                            appointments as skill and science could make it one that would stand for
                            centuries, and be appropriate for dispensing the hospitalities of the
                            Executive mansion, and a pleasant house for the Governor's family. The
                            property proposed to be sold would probably bring enough to build such a
                            house. He was well acquainted with one of the Commissioners named in the
                            bill, and thought him in all respects a good man to be intrusted with
                            the sale of the property and the management of the proceeds. But he
                            hoped the bill would not pass in its present form.
                        Mr. CULLEN concurred in the remarks made by the gentleman from Laporte
                            [Mr. Niles] and in order that the bill may be perfected he moved to
                            recommit the bill and amendment to a select committee of five.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    
                    
                        EXEMPTION OF SOLDIERS' PROPERTY.
                        Mr. BENNETT, by direction of the Judiciary Committee,
                            submitted the following report:
                        MR. PRESIDENT :The Committee on the
                                Judiciary, to whom was referred Senate Bill No. 78,
                            entitled "An act exempting certain Real and Personal Property from
                            Taxation in certain cases," introduced by Senator Bennett, have had the
                            same under consideration, and have directed me to report the same back
                            to the Senate, with the recommendation that it lie upon the table, for
                            the reason that they believe its provisions to be unconstitutional. Sec.
                            1st of article 10th of the State Constitution is as follows, viz:" 
                        The General Assembly shall provide by law for a uniform and equal rate of
                            assessment and taxation; and shall prescribe such regulations as shall
                            secure a just valuation for taxation of all property, both real and
                            personal, excepting such only for municipal,
                            educational, literary, scientific, religious or charitable purposes, as
                            may be specially exempted by law."
                        While your committee are deeply sensible of the hardships imposed upon
                            that class of our citizens who have served in the armies of the United
                            States,by the collection, of taxes from their property, to pay bounties
                            to induce other citizens, equally liable to military duty, to enter the
                            army, and while your committee unanimously and earnestly favor the bill
                            under consideration, upon principle, yet its provisions are so clearly
                            in contravention of the provisions of the constitution above recited,
                            that they are reluctantly compelled to report against its passage.
                        Mr. BENNETT. Before this report is adopted, and the Bill finally disposed
                            of, I desire to say a word in reference to its provisions.-- There are
                            involved in this bill questions of great importance to a large portion
                            of our citizens-that portion, too, for whom I trust we all feel a deep
                            interest. I mean the gallant, brave, and patriotic soldiers of Indiana,
                            who for the last four years, have reflected so much credit upon our
                            beloved State, and rendered such eminent services to the common country,
                            The bill provides that the property of all soldiers in the army; of all
                            soldiers who have served their time in the army; of all soldiers; who
                            have been disabled in the service; and of all widows and miner children
                            of deceased soldiers, shall be exempt from all taxes levied to pay
                            bounties to procure volunteers or substitutes. And while I am compelled
                            to agree with the honorable committee that the provisions of this bill
                            are unconstitutional, being in opposition to the section of the
                            Constitution recited in their report; yet I must say that such a
                            decision, correct as it is, has changed my whole idea of taxation for
                            the purpose of raising bounties.
                        Sir, while it is true that I am here as the representative of all classes
                            of people, I am especially the representative of the soldier in the
                            field, and shall, so far as I am able, guard every interest of his with
                            an earnest solicitor and zealous care. I think I know something of the
                            soldier's merits, and the soldier's wants. And I thank God to-day that,
                            from the beginning of the war up to the present time. I have been a
                            soldier in army of the Union, and have with Indiana's "brave boys in
                            blue,"suffered their hardships and dangers, and shared with them their
                            honors and their glories. I hope the Senate will pardon my seeming
                            vanity, when I refer to my connection with the army; for it is the pride
                            of my life, and it is but an act of simple justice to allow me to
                            cherish and enjoy it. Then, sir, it may not be considered strange that I
                            should devote a great share of my legislative duties to the interests of
                            the soldier. I do not claim for myself a devotion to the cause of the
                            soldier, above that of any other Senator. I am glad to find here,
                            without distinction of party, a feeling of pride in the glorious record
                            of Indiana soldiers. And do they not deserve our admiration and love,
                            and demand of us, all the fostering care we can throw around them? The
                            time was, when it was no great credit to claim to be an Indiana soldier,
                            for cowards in high places had tarnished the fair fame of our gallant
                            State; but the wheel of fortune has turned on, and the "the coward,"
                            adding treason to his cowardice, has gone down beneath the breath of
                            popular indignation, while the State that he attempted to disgrace, has,
                            by the bravery of her soldiers, and the patriotism of her people, been
                            "redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled,"  ed," and to-day stands among, if not the
                            very foremost on the records of gallantry. So that to-day the blush of
                            shame has departed, and next to that of an American citizen, no prouder
                            title can be claimed than that of an "Indiana Volunteer." This glorious
                            consummation has cost us much, for our brave boys have fallen on every
                            battle-field of the Republic, and their silent graves are scattered all
                            over the country, along the banks of the Potomac, the James, and the
                            Rapidan; in the desolated valley of the Shenandoah; on the green
                            mountain slopes of Western Virginia; in the valleys of the Cumberland
                            and the Tennessee; on either side of the great father of waters down to
                            the gulf and all along the coast from the Rio Grande to Hampton Roads.
                            These brave men, the living and the dead, and their families, are
                            objects of especial interest to every citizen of Indiana. While I shall
                            advocate and vote for every sure that looks to the support of soldiers'
                            families and the care of the soldier in the field volunteer, substitute
                            and drafted man alike, I shall not support any measure that taxes the
                            property of the soldier in the field-the soldier who has served out his
                            time-of the soldier who has been discharged on account of rounds and
                            disability received in the service-of the widows and orphans of soldiers
                            who have lost their lives in the service, for the purpose of raising
                            bounties to induce others to perform the same service, or te prevent
                            others from having to perform such service. I will vote to legalize all
                            that has been done. Then I will stop, unless the law can be made to
                            shield these worthy men from the rigors of the oppressive taxation which
                            will be inevitable.
                        The report of the committee was concurred in, and so the bill lies on the
                            table.
                    



                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.

                        Mr. Noyes's Felony Bill [S. 28,see page
                                38,] Mr. Niles's joint Contract Bill [S. 44 see page53,] and
                            Mr. Gaff's Aurora Turnpike Bill [S. 60,] were read the second time and
                            passed to the third reading.
                    



                    
                        COUNTY OFFICERS.
                        Mr. Bonham's bill [S. 63]
                            prohibiting County officers and their deputies from practicing law
                            in any court in this State, was read the second time.
                        Mr. MOORE moved to amend by striking from the bill all that relates to
                            Sheriffs, Treasurers and Auditors.
                        Mr. WRIGHT spoke very briefly in favor of the amendment, and Messrs.
                            BROWN, of Wells, and BONHAM against it.
                        Mr. MASON was of opinion that these officials should foe prevented from
                            practicing for they made a sufficient amount to keep them out of their
                            salaries.
                        Mr. DUNNING did not think it right to put these men in office and then
                            allow them to get a practice they never would have obtained had it not
                            been for their official position. It is wrong for any man to have
                            possession of papers belonging; to a party against whom he is the
                            opposing attorney.
                        Mr. NILES. If there be a nuisance in any community more-detestable than
                            another, it is a lawyer who is constantly stirring up strife among his
                            neighbors, and he would not put in the way of any lawyer the temptations
                            for such a vocation which the occupancy of these offices does afford.
                            And if the law is a respectable profession, it must be saved from such
                            degradation.
                        Mr. MOORE would vote for the bill were his amendment adopted, otherwise
                            he should vote against it,
                        Mr. WILLIAMS inquired how any voter possessing a good moral character,
                            could be prevented from practicing in the Courts of the State. The
                            Constitution guarantees to such an one this right.
                        Mr. NILES. That provision of the Constitution has not escaped our notice.
                            It is to receive a reasonable and Mr construction. It surely does not
                            deprive us of the right to exclude a Circuit Judge, or a Judge of the
                            Supreme Court, from practicing. That is not an iron rule which shall
                            admit of no qualification.
                        Mr. BENNETT. This bill is a bill not for the benefit of attorneys, but
                            for the benefit of the parties in action in Courts. We are prescribing
                            what our officers shall do, not what citizens shall do. Officers accept
                            the rights and privileges of the office to which they are elected, and
                            we are but saying that they shall not leave their business in the Court
                            House, and be running all over the county attending to business of their
                            own.
                        Mr. GIFFORD moved to refer the bill and pending amendments to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges of the Inhabitants of
                                the State.
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the motion to refer was laid on the table, by
                            yeas 37, nays 5; and the motion to amend was laid on the table by yeas
                            30, nays 13.On motion by 
                         Mr. DOWNEY, the bill was amended by adding these words: "in any case  or matter in which his court has
                            or may have jurisdiction.
                        The bill was then ordered to he engrossed.
                    


                    
                        INCREASING RATES OF TOLL.
                        Mr. Bradley's bill [S. 65] giving authority to Boards of Directors of
                            turnpike or plank road companies to charge a higher rate of toll than
                            the law now allows, was read the second time.
                         Mr. BOWMAN moved to amend by striking out all in regard to sheep, hogs
                            and cattle, and insert in lieu thereof the provisions of the old
                            law.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. TERRY, this amendment was laid on the table, by yeas 31,
                            nays 9.
                        The bill was then ordered engrossed.
                    

                    
                         RECESS TILL MONDAY.
                        Leave being granted, 
                        Mr. BONHAM offered the following resolution, which was adopted by
                            consent:

                        PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.
                        Mr. CULLEN offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the State Printer be
                                        ordered to print for the use of the Governor and the members
                                        of the Senate, eight thousand copies of the accompanying
                                        documents to the Governor's message; and that the State
                                        Librarian be directed to forward to each member of the
                                        Senate an equal portion of the same as fast as they are
                                        delivered.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. MASON moved to amend the resolution by striking out "8,000" and
                            inserting in lieu thereof "5,000."
                        
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 17.
                        The resolution, as amended, was adopted by consent.
                    
                    
                        BASTARDY.
                        Mr. CASON from the Judiciary Committee returned the
                            bastardy bill [8. 52] with a report recommending its passage with
                            amendments.
                        The report was concurred in. 
                    
                    
                        LEAVES OF ABSENCE
                        Were obtained for Messrs. Dykes and Hiatt till Wednesday
                    


                    
                        THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
                        Mr. CORBIN offered the following, which was adopted by consent:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, It is reported that some of the
                                        officers of the benevolent institution of the State have
                                        prostituted said institutions to the advancement of personal
                                        ends, and contrary to the welfare and good government of the
                                        same,
                                    AND WHEREAS. It is the duty of the
                                        citizens of the State to guard with a frugal hand the
                                        expenditure of money made for the government of said
                                        institutions, therefore, be it
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Benevolent Institutions are hereby directed to
                                        make full investigation relative to said reports, and if
                                        necessary, to send for persons and papers, and report what
                                        remedy, if any, is necessary to correct such evils.
                                
                            
                        
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                    
                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        FRIDAY, January 27,1865.
                    
                    The House met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The journal of yesterday was read and approved. 
                    
                        SPECIAL COMMITTEES.
                        The SPEAKER announced the following special committees:
                        Special committee on Mr. Coffroth's bill, [H. R. No. 4] fixing the per
                            diem, of members of the General Assembly, &c:
                         Messrs. Griffith, Stewart, Buskirk, Boyd and Lassalle.
                        Special committee on Mr. Shoaff of Allen's dog bill:
                        Messrs. Collins, Stringer, Gregg, Gregory of Montgomery, Abbett and
                            Shoaff of Allen.
                        Special committee on Mr. Miller of Tippecanoe's resolution of January
                            19th, (inquiring into the loyalty of Mr. Lasselle, Representative from
                            the county of Cass:)
                        Messrs. Miller, of Tippecanoe, Dunhan, Lockhart, Frather, and
                            Coffroth.
                        Special committee on the organization of Courts of Common Pleas:
                        Messrs. Coffroth, Emerson, Groves, Prather, Ferris, Kilgore, Newcomb,
                            Humphreys, Roach, Lasselle, and Shuey.
                    

                    
                         AMENDMENT OF THE RULES.
                         Mr. GRIFFITH moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday, by which the
                            proposition of the gentleman from St. Joseph, [Mr. Henricks,] to amend
                            the 58th and 59th rules was rejected. He made this motion at the request
                            of other gentlemen, without committing himself to the support of the
                            proposed amendment.
                         Mr.BUSKIRK trusted the vote would not be reconsidered. The House decided
                            right. The best way to hasten legislation was to adhere strictly to
                            established parliamentary rules. He would have bills defeated, if they
                            should be, by a direct vote: and allow every man to make his own record. 
                        Mr. HENRICKS stated his object in proposing this amendment of the rules,
                            It was to facilitate business. No man could sufficiently inform himself
                            of a bill by the reading at the Clerk's table. How many could tell what
                            was in the journal of yesterday that had just been read by the Clerk?
                            Bills have to go to the committees some time, and he could not see why
                            they should not go at once. He wanted to get along with business. We
                            were now in the fourth week of the session, and of some ninety bills
                            introduced, but a very small portion of them had yet been referred. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH was not clear yet that the amendment would expedite
                            business. The precedents were against it; but at all events he would
                            vote for the reconsideration.
                        The vote was reconsidered.
                        The proposed amendment of the 58th rule was then reported by the Clerk.
                            It adds words to this effect: "The bill [introduced] shall then be
                            referred to the committee without debate. Any member desiring to offer
                            an amendment, may hand it in in writing, or by any member of the
                            committee. In the 59th rule it inserts "re" before the word
                            "committed."
                        Mr. BROWN moved to amend the amendment of the rule, by striking out the
                            words ''without debate."
                        Mr. GRIFFITH saw now, since the reading of the proposition, that it would
                            cut off amendments in the House, and give the committee control of
                            amendments.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Amendments may be sent,the Committee, or submitted in the
                            House. The member can make his own record just as well. The advantage of
                            the modification  would be this,
                            that where we have several bills on the same subject, the committee
                            would give us but one.
                         Mr. BROWN submitted that it would take longer to dispose of one bill
                            under the amended rule, than to pass upon five as the rules now stand.
                            But if the rule was to be amended, he insisted that the words "without
                            debate" should be stricken out. He would not give the committees power
                            to make final disposition of bills without the action of the House. 
                        
                        Mr. Brown's amendment was rejected--affirmative 33, negative 37.
                        
                        Mr. HENRICK'S amendment (of the rule 58) was then adopted-- affirmative
                            42, negative 33.
                         The other amendment was taken by consent. 

                        Mr. BUSKIRK. This action of the House render his amendment of the Rules
                            much more necessary than it was before. He now moved the adoption of the
                            following amendment--adding a new rule, of which he had filed his
                            notice, viz:

                        
                            
                                
                                     "Rule-. When a bill or joint resolution has been committed
                                        or re-committed to either a Standing or Select Committee,
                                        and such committee shall recommend amendments thereto, such
                                        amendments and such further amendments as may be offered
                                        thereto shall be immediately acted on, unless the
                                        consideration thereof, at such time, shall be postponed by
                                        the House."
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK explained the operation of this rule, submitted
                            considerations to show its advantage over the practice under the ruling
                            of the Chair.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. Power was continually stealing from the many to the few.
                            Since the adoption of Mr. Henricks amendment, a few members might as
                            well take all the business of legislation in hand, and let the balance
                            of us go home. He had voted for the reconsideration above given, and so
                            far helped it on. He now appealed to the friends of that innovation, to
                            remedy the difficulty by adopting this. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM objected to the proposed rule, because it would place it in
                            the power of a few men in the committees to occupy the entire time of
                            the House, by reporting amendments and insisting upon their
                            consideration. He hoped to see the time when every important bill would
                            be printed.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, took a similar view. As the rules stood now,
                            they repressed debate.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. This was all specious reasoning. He denied that the rules
                            now restrained debate, or that the amendment would invite debate.
                            Gentleman talked of this as an innovation. The former practice in this
                            body had been in consonance with this rule which he had now offered.
                        The SPEAKER said, if the ruling of the Chair subverted usage, the House
                            had adopted rules that subverted the precedents. The Chair stated the
                            ruling and the reasons for it at length.
                        
                        The proposed amendment to the Rules was rejected--affirmative 30,
                            negative 43,
                        Mr. BIGGIN'S now submitted his proposed amendment to the first rule,
                            adding these words: "unless by a vote of the House the reading; of the
                            journal be dispensed with."
                        The amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved ineffectually to suspend the order of business to
                            enable him to report back the county war bond bill, No, 70.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH gave notice of his intention, at some future day of the
                            session, to move to amend the rules so that only a majority vote shall
                            be necessary to suspend the rules.
                        Mr. DUNHAM gave notice that on Monday, perhaps, be would move to amend
                            the 59th rule so that a bill on the third reading may be referred with
                            special instructions to amend--according to universal parliamentary
                            usage.
                        Mr. MILROY submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to return to this
                                        House immediately the Senate Bill No. 3, in relation to the
                                        right of counties to levy a tax for bounty purposes.
                                
                            
                        
                    



                    
                         LEGISLATIVE EXPENSES.
                        Mr. BURWELL moved that the order of business be suspended to admit of
                            taking up the Senate Bill No. 1, providing for Legislative expenses.
                        The motion was agreed to, and the bill was taken up, viz: The bill, (S. No. 1,) appropriating $75,000
                            for Legislative expenses, &c.
                        It was read the second time by the Clerk.
                        Mr. WRIGHT made an ineffectual motion to refer the bill to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. HIGGINS proposed to amend, by adding to the third section these
                            words: "And the Auditor of State shall also audit and issue his warrant
                            to such of the Members of the House of Representatives of the year 1863
                            as had their per diem reduced, for the amount so reduced."
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the amendment on the table, and demanded the yeas
                            and nays.
                        The yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken resulted--yeas 41, nays
                            44, as follows:
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Yeas--Messrs. Abbett, Beckett, Bird, Brown, Burton,
                                        Burwell,Buskirk, Coffroth, Colover, Croan, Dunham,
                                        Glazebrook, Gregg, Griffith, Hargrove, Harrison, Humphreys,
                                        Hunt, Lee, Lemon, Lopp, Milroy, O'Brien, Usborn, Perigo,
                                        Puett, Richards, Richardson, Roach, Sabin, Shoaff, of Allen,
                                        Shoaff, of Jay, Stenger, Stivers, Stuckey, Sullivan, of
                                        Scott, Thacher, Upson, Veach and White--41.
                                    Nays--Messrs. Banta, Bomier, Boyd, Branham, Barries,
                                        Chambers, Church, Cox, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke, Goodman,
                                        Gregory, of Warren, Groves, Henricks, Hershey, Higgins,
                                        Hogate, Hoover, Kilgore, Lockhart, Major, Meredith, Miller,
                                        of Tippecanoe, Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb, Olleman, Prather,
                                        Reese, Riford, Shuey, Sim, Stewart, Stringer,, Welch,
                                        Whiteside, Willis, Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zeigler and Mr.
                                        Speaker--44.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the motion was rejected and the question recurred on Mr. Higgins's
                            amendment.
                        Mr. BROWN recited the history of this reduction of per diem. It was
                            resolved by the House that the amount so reduced should be paid into the
                            military fund. He could not say that it was so paid. He moved to amend
                            the amendment, by making the amount payable to members that
                            ''bolted."
                        Mr. BUSKIRK read the law regulating the per diem-itself reducing the per
                            diem of members "absent without leave." Should an amendment change the
                            law without the formality of repeal?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. We did not amend the law. Laws cannot have a retro-active
                            force. We make an appropriation.
                        Mr. COFFROTH proposed an allowance of mileage to the bolters to Madison
                            and back.
                        
                        The SPEAKER. It was out of order.
                        Mr. HIGGINS recited the reason for that bolt-the "Military bill." No
                            amount of money equal to the amount embraced in his amendment, had ever
                            been applied to an object better subserving the public welfare. He read
                            the proceedings on that "Military bill' from pages 476, 620 of the last
                            House journal, by way of reply to matter heretofore advanced in debate
                            on this subject, going to show the reason why the "Military bill" was
                            pressed by the majority. He knew that Democratic members were not
                            opposed to the passage of that bill. But since that time a change had
                            come over them. It was only since that time they had begun to say the
                            bill could not have passed. The State ought to pay that minority for the
                            time they spent in defeating that bill.
                        With reference to the Appropriation bill of that session, he said, it was
                            introduced on the day before the last day when it could be sent to the
                            Governor. It was not the design of the majority of that House to pass
                            the Appropriation bill. They proposed to force the Governor to call
                            another session of the Legislature. He was sustained in this statement
                            by the gentleman from Delaware, (Mr. Kilgore.)
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippeconoe, moved to lay Mr. Brown's amendment on the
                            table:
                        
                        Which was agreed to--yeas 49, nays 33.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted an amendment to the amendment, viz:
                        After the word "absent" in the amendment insert the following: "and not
                            engaged in the business of the General Assembly, and not being able from
                            sickness to attend to the business of the House."
                        Mr. BRANHAM made an ineffectual motion to refer the bill and pending
                            amendments to the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved to lay Mr. Buskirk's amendment on the table.
                        
                        The yeas and nays (demanded by Messrs. Milroy and Beckett) were taken
                            thereon, resulting--yeas 49, nays 36--as follows:

                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS-Messrs. Banta, Bonner, Boyd, Branham, Burnes, Chambers,
                                        Church, Cox, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke, Goodman, Gregory, of
                                        Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren, Griffith, Groves, Henricks,
                                        Hershey, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover, Kilgore, Lockhart, Major,
                                        Meredith, Miller of Tippecanoe, Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb,
                                        Olleman, Prather, Reese, Rhoads, Riford, Sabin, Shuey, Sim,
                                        Stewart, Stiver, Stringer, Trusler, Upson, Welch, Willis,
                                        Woodruff, Woods, Wright, Zeigler and Mr. Speaker-49.
                                    Nays-Abbett, Beckett, Bird, Brown, Burton, Burwell, Buskirk,
                                        Coffroth, Colover, Croan, Durham, Glazebrook, Gregg,
                                        Hargrove, Harrison, Humphreys, Hunt, Laselle, Lemon, Lopp,
                                        Milroy, O' Brien, Osborn, Perigo, Puett, Richards,
                                        Richardson, Roach, Shoaff, of Allen, Shoaff, of Jay,
                                        Stinger, Stuckey, Sullivan, of Scott, Thacher, Veach and
                                        White-36.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. GRIFFITH (explaining.) I contend that the business of the General
                            Assembly is the business of the State. We were absent on the business of
                            the State. I vote aye.
                        So the amendment was laid on the table.
                        Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the amendment by adding, "Provided there
                            shall be appriated a sufficient sum to pay to a certain man in Madison
                            by the name of Belcher, who keeps a saloon there, the debts contracted
                            with him by the bolters, for ale and beer."
                        The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman send up his amendment in writing?
                        Mr. BROWN. I would ask the gentleman from Jefferson, whether those
                            drinking debts were paid?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Mr. Belcher has no claims.
                        Mr. BROWN withdrew the amendment.
                        Mr. BRANHAM suggested items of inequality, if not injustice in the bill,
                            and urged that this was the only bill of the kind that the House had
                            refused to refer to the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            He would not vote to supply ourselves with money till we relieve our
                            soldiers' families. He went into some argument and some specific
                            statements with reference to the bolt of the minority of the House at
                            the last session of the General Assembly-asserting that the gentleman
                            from Laporte had shown clearly the determination of the majority there
                            to pass the Military Bill. And Mr. B. alleged that it was originated and
                            urged upon that House by a secret, revolutionary political organization
                            then meeting nightly in this city, and styling themselves American
                            Knights, or Knights of the Golden Circle.
                        Mr. COFFROTH (interposing, and Mr. B. giving away.) The American Knights
                            or Sons of Liberty were mot organized till August, 1863.
                        Mr. BRANHAM had heard of them in November, 1862.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB (interposing). The grand jury of the United States District
                            Court made presentments in the latter part of 1862, which brought it to
                            his certain knowledge that there was a secret political order at that
                            time in the State.
                        Mr. COFFROTH (interposing), The order he had mentioned was organized at
                            Terre Haute in August, 1863; and on the 10th of September, the same
                            year, the Grand Council met in Indianapolis for the first time.
                        Mr. MILROY (interposing) was a member of the House Military
                                Committee of the session of 1863. He neither belonged to
                            any secret political order, nor was he influenced by any; and the man
                            that will say he was ever influenced by any such order in his action in
                            the House tells a falsehood.
                        Mr. PUETT (interposing) made a similar statement. He did not intend to
                            vote for that bill on its final passage. Other members had signified to
                            him that they would not. The engrossment was ordered at a moment of
                            excitement.
                        Mr. ABBETT (interposing) said he was here, met at a Democratic caucus,
                            during the cession, and he never had any knowledge of any secret society
                            in Indianapolis, and was not certainly influenced by any. Since he left
                            the seductions of the contemptible Know Nothing organization there was
                            nothing in that direction that he could admire or advise with.
                        Mr. BRANHAM (resuming) went into a more particular statement of the
                            proceedings of Democratic caucuses during that session. He recited
                            things connected with a committee appointed to investigate a charge he
                            had made on the floor, endorsing in his speech every opposition to the
                            Military bill, denouncing and declaring that the object of the
                            originators of that bill was revolutionary. And he was willing to bear
                            any words of obloquy that might be cast upon him for his opposition to
                            it,  so long as he felt that he had
                            saved his State from the devastations of civil war. 
                        He felt a good deal better here now than he felt here last session. He
                            saw himself now backed by a majority of the House, and that majority
                            backed by a majority of the people of the State. 
                        How came it about, if these gentlemen had no knowledge of the schemes of
                            their leading men, that they followed their lead so far? He could not
                            tell. And these leaders only developed their schemes by way of securing
                            themselves under the baby act, against merited punishment. And when
                            Republican members proposed to resign and go before the people, they got
                            for answer-We've got the power, and we mean to use it. After taking a
                            wide range, he sat down, he said, having administered but a part of the
                            dose.
                        Mr. KILGORE moved that the House adjourn, but gave way for-
                        Mr. BRANHAM, who moved that when the House adjourns, it shall be till
                            Monday at two o'clock P. M.
                        Which was taken by consent.
                        Several members obtained leave of absence till Tuesday and Wednesday.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a Message from the Governor, responding
                            to Mr. Brown's resolution, calling, on him to lay before the House the
                            annual reports of the Auditor and Treasurer of State, together with all
                            other reports which by law he is required to present to this
                            House,-transmitting the reports of the Auditor and Treasurer of State;
                            and stating that the report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction
                            has not yet come from the press.
                        And then, [at 5:30 o'clock,] the House adjourned till Monday two o'clock
                            P. M.
                    

                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        MONDAY, January 30, 1865.
                    
                    The Lieutenant Governor being absent, Mr. Dunning resumed the Chair at 2
                        o'clock P. M.

                    
                        HORSE THIEF DETECTIVES.
                        Mr. NILES presented a petition from numerous citizens of La Porte county,
                            praying for an amendment of the present law on the subject of mutual
                            protection against horse thieves, so as to make it more efficient.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that the present law was defective, and needed
                            amendment.
                        The petition, together with a letter from James Moore, Esq., was, on his
                            motion, referred to the Committee on Agriculture.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of the bills [S. 34,] to
                            continue the service of a warrant throughout the State, and [S. 61,]
                            amending section 4 of the Landlord Act, approved May 20, 1854, which
                            bills were read the second time, and severally ordered to be engrossed
                            for the third reading.
                    

                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        By Mr. BENNETT, [S.103,] to amend section 35 of an act repealing all
                            general laws for the incorporation of cities, &c., approved March 9,
                            1857.
                        By Mr. TERRY, [S. 104,] to amend section 2 of an act regulating the sale
                            of swamp lands, the draining and reclaiming thereof, &c., approved
                            May 29, 1852. [The Treasurer's bond (of a county in which lie swampy
                            lands,) to be in such sum as the Auditor of State shall direct, for the
                            faithful performance of his duties as swamp land agent of the State
                            ]
                        By Mr. DOUGLAS, [S. 105,] to amend section 2 of an act fixing the per
                            diem and mileage of members of the General Assembly, Secretaries, Clerks
                            and Door-keepers thereof, approved June 4, 1852. [Making the pay of
                            officers $5 a day, and authorizes but one Door-keeper for each
                            House.]
                        By Mr. HORD, [S. 106.] to amend section 119 of the Practice Act, approved
                            June 17, 1852, so far as to strike out so much thereof as requires the
                            appellee to pay the costs of the appeal when the decision of the court
                            below is decided to be erroneous.
                        By Mr. WRIGHT, [S. 107,] authorizing certain persons therein named to dig
                            and construct a certain canal. [Joseph and William Young, of Porter
                            county; Elihu Griffin, David Turner and Zera F. Summers, of Lake county,
                            to dig a canal from the Calumet river to Lake Michigan.]
                        By Mr. NILES, [S. 108,] to amend section 6 of an act regulating divorce?,
                            &c., approved May 13, 1852, so as more effectually to guard against
                            fraudulent divorces, by requiring the petitioner to file with the
                            complaint, the affidavit of two resident householders, that the
                            petitioner has to their personal knowledge been two years an actual
                            resident of this State.
                        By Mr. CARSON, [S. 109,] to amend section 150 of an act to provide for a
                            general system of common schools, &c., approved March 5, 1855, so
                            that where the parents or guardians of thirty scholars desire it, the
                            German language may be taught exclusively, and they shall have the right
                            to name the teacher.
                        By Mr. CORBIN, [S. 110,] to
                            provide for the clothing and other personal expenses of pupils of the
                            benevolent institutions of the State, and to provide for their removal
                            to and from said institutions in certain cases. 
                        By Mr. BROWN, of Wells, [S. 111,] to apportion Senators and
                            Representatives for the next six years.
                    
                    
                        BARTHOLOMEW COUNTY COURTS.
                        
                        The House amendments to the bill [S.
                                6] changing the times of holding the Common Pleas Courts in
                            Bartholomew county, were read and concurred in by the Senate.
                        The bill takes effect immediately and fixes the time for holding the
                            court in Bartholomew county on the third Mondays in March, July and
                            November, giving three weeks for each term if the business thereof shall
                            require it.
                    
                    
                        PAY OF TOWNSHIP ASSESSORS.
                        The bill [S. 100] fixing the pay
                            of township assessors at $2 50 per day, was read the second time.
                        Mr. MOORE moved to amend by striking out "$2 50" and inserting in lieu
                            thereof "$2" as the per diem of township assessors.
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT opposed the amendment and hoped the question would be
                            postponed till the Senate should be full, for he would like to see the
                            yeas and nays taken on it.
                        Mr. RICHMOND stated that a majority of the committee in which the bill
                            originated, favored $3 a day, as the times are, and thought the pay was
                            certainly little, enough at $2 50. He preferred that this question
                            should not be passed on to-day.
                         Mr. MOORE. Let it go over, then, till there is a fall Senate.
                        Mr. CASON did not understand the gentleman [t?]o demand the yeas and
                            nays.
                        Mr. MOORE did not want to call the yeas and nays to-day. He moved to lay
                            the bill and amendment on the table.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    
                    
                        WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                        Senate bills 102 and 103 (introduced Friday); 24 (see page 38) and 66 (p.
                            85,) were read the second time and appropriately referred.
                    
                    
                        TERRE HAUTE AND RICHMOND RAILROAD.
                        Mr. Thompson's bill [S. 68,]
                            changing the name of the Terre Haute and Richmond railroad, and giving
                            further time for the completion of said road, was read the second
                            time.
                        Mr. COBB. I have not had the opportunity to examine this bill, and I hope
                            that the Senator who has it in charge will not press it until its
                            provisions can be examined by Senators. This is another Railroad bill,
                            the provisions of which should be scrutinized well before it passes.
                            This is a bill which among other things provides for changing the name
                            of the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad Company, and giving further
                            time to complete their road. I suggest that the bill be referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary, and then let it be
                            examined, amended if necessary and reported back. This is one of the
                            best paying roads in the State, and it is a well known fact that there
                            is less accommodation extended by it to the citizens, than any other
                            railroad in the State, to say nothing of its treatment toward other
                            railroad companies. This company was chartered in 1847, and I understand
                            that there is a provision in the charter, requiring the company to pay
                            into the State Treasury ten per cent, of its net earnings for the
                            support of common schools. Of this fact I am not advised certainly. I
                            have examined the State Library to find a copy of the local laws passed
                            by the Legislature of that year, which contains this charter, but they
                            are not to bs found. I should like to have time to examine its
                            provisions on this subject. I further understand that there is another
                            provision in the charter, which provides that the company shall not
                            charge more than three cents per mile for carrying passengers on its
                            road.
                        These questions should be examined into, and if my information is
                            correct, this company should be compelled to comply with its charter by
                            the passage of a law by this General Assembly. It should not be allowed
                            to pocket money which was intended to go to help educate the children of
                            our State, and should not be allowed to charge its passengers more than
                            is provided for by its charter. Its charter is its rule of action, and
                            it should be compelled to live up to that rule until it is changed by
                            law, and if the company want that change it should comply with its
                            charter and ask that it be amended, if it operates upon its rights
                            harshly. I would do nothing to interfere with the the legal rights of
                            railroad companies in our State. I think I duly appreciate the
                            advantages which the people of State derive from such corporations, and
                            would not do them injury, but I would make them obey the laws as I would
                            an individual, and when that law operates against their just interest, I
                            would amend it. I hope, then, sir, that this bill will be laid over
                            until the feels which I have suggested can be ascertained, and if they
                            are true, this bill should be amended so as to require the company to
                            comply with its charter before the taking effect of the law.
                        Mr. HANNA, I hope the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Cobb] will not press his
                            suggestion that this bill shall be referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                            I think he is laboring under misapprehension about this bill. It has
                            already passed under the review of the Committee on Corporations, of
                            which I am a member. We have examined the bill carefully, and find it in
                            accordance with the public welfare. The road, known as the Terre Haute
                            and Richmond Railroad, simply asks for a change of its corporate name,
                            and also asks further time for the completion of its line from Terre
                            Haute to a point on the western boundary of the State of Indiana. That
                            is all, sir. Whatever other questions the Senator may wish to
                            investigate with reference to this road, this not the proper place to do
                            it. I will go as far as any Senator on this floor to surround railroad
                            corporations with restrictions in the performance of their charter
                            contracts. If the people, sir, I have the honor to represent choose to
                            travel more than some other people, and by public spirit and the
                            judicious investment of capital to so enlarge their trade and commerce
                            as to render their railroads paying investments, I cannot see that it is
                            a fact properly the subject of criticism. I hope the gentleman will
                            press his examinations in the proper form, and not attach them to the
                            pending bill. This measure has a single purpose which is easily
                            understood, and against which, I apprehend, there can be no serious
                            objections. Let the bill lie over until to-morrow, Mr. Presdent, that
                            the Senator from Lawrence may satisfy himself.
                        Mr. DUNNING complimented the management of the T. H. and R. R. R., and
                            said that he thought it was as accommodating as any railroad in the
                            State.
                        Mr. THOMPSON spoke in favor of the passsage of his bill, stated again its
                            provisions, and insisted that there must be some mistake in the charge
                            that this railroad company had not complied with the provisions of its
                            charter.
                        On motion of Mr. COBB, the bill was laid on the table

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Roads be instructed to inquire into the
                                        propriety of an act authorizing the location of public
                                        highways running from public highways already located by the
                                        most direct and practicable route to works used by the
                                        public as mills, factories, &c., said roads to be
                                        constructed and kept in repairs as other public highways,
                                        with leave to report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        PAY OF SCHOOL TEACHERS.
                        Mr. MOORE offered the following, which was adopted, by consent:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Education be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of making it the duty of the township trustee to
                                        make the pay of teachers uniform throughout the township,
                                        with leave to report by bill or otherwise.

                        and in the absence of the Speaker, nominated Mr. Higgins for presiding
                        officer pro tem, and the same being taken by consent.
                    Mr. HIGGINS took the Chair, and directed a call of the House roll.
                    The call proceeded, and 56 members answered to their names, as follows,
                        viz:
                    
                    
                    
                        
                            

                                 Messrs. Abbett, Banta, Beckett, Bonner, Branham, Burnes, Church,
                                    Collins, Colover, Cook, Cox, Croan, Emerson, Ferris, Goodman,
                                    Glazebrook, Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren,
                                    Griffith, Groves, Hargrove, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover, Humphreys,
                                    Hunt, James, Kilgore, Laselle, Lemon, Lockhart, Major, Meredith,
                                    Miller, of Tippecanoe, Milroy, Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb,
                                    Olleman, Osborn, Perigo, Puett, Richards, Richardson. Riford,

                    Mr. BRANHAM. As there was not likely to be a quorum, in order to give time
                        for business before the committees, he suggested an adjournment till
                        to-morrow morning.
                    Mr. GLAZEBROOK. There were only 11 or 12 names wanting. He thought a quorum
                        would come in.
                    Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, moved a call of the absentees, which was agreed to by
                        consent.
                    The call was ordered and proceeded, but still no quorum appearing-
                    Mr. SULLIVAN moved that the House adjourn, till to-morrow morning nine
                        o'clock.
                    The House divided on this question-affirmative 32, negative 18-no quorum
                        voting.
                    Whereupon-
                    The PRESIDING OFFICER declared the House adjourned.
                


                

                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         TUESDAY, January 31, 1865.

                            authorizing the construction of free turnpikes; which was referred to
                            the Committee on Agriculture.

                        Mr. DAVIS presented a petition from the officers of Vermillion county,
                            praying for additional compensation; which was referred to the special
                                 Committee on Fees and Salaries.

                            recommending that it lie on the table, as the change proposed is neither
                            necessary nor desirable. 
                        The Committee on Benevolent Institutions imported a
                            substitute for the bill S. 38, (see page 44)
                        The special committee thereon returned the bill [S. 41,] authorizing the sale of
                            the Executive Mansion and creating commissioners to furnish a suitable
                            residence for the Governor; recommending passage with an amendment
                            appropriating $5,000 a year to the Governor until a residence for him
                            shall be provided,
                        Which reports were severally concurred in.

                            proceedings of the House printed below.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING the report, without reading was laid on the

                         OUR SOLDIERS IN SOUTHERN PRISONS.
                        Mr. HORD introduced a joint resolutions, [S. 14,] concerning the exchange
                            of the Indiana officers and soldiers held as prisoners of war in
                            Southern Prisons; which was read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                        It is as follows:

                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, Indiana has many brave officers
                                        and soldiers, who are now held as prisoners of war,
                                        languishing in Southern prisons on account of the existence
                                        of a lame system for the exchange of prisoners, where they
                                        have been confined for a long time; AND,
                                            WHEREAS, Duty, humanity and justice to our soldiers
                                        dictate an amelioration of the fortunes of war by the
                                        adoption of some perfect and speedy system of exchange,
                                        therefore;
                                    Be it Resolved, By the General Assembly of the
                                            State of Indiana, That our Senators be instructed,
                                        and our Representatives in Congress be requested to use
                                        their influence to secure the adoption of some just and
                                        speedy system of exchange of the officers and soldiers who
                                        are now held, or may hereafter be held, as prisoners of war;
                                        and that their exertions may be immediate in their behalf;
                                        and that a copy of this resolution be remitted to each
                                        Senator and Member of Congress from this State.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. HORD, Mr. President, I invoke at the hands of the Senate an early and
                            candid consideration of the resolution just offered. I was induced to
                            introduce it, after reading some 
                            private letters of Captain Michael McGrayel of the 93d Indiana--as
                            valiant and brave a man as ever smelt of battle, or slew a foe. He, with
                            his company and many other brave officers and soldiers, while facing
                            danger amid the hail and smoke and storm of battle, meeting with defiant
                            front and conduct an enemy in arms, were taken prisoners and have been
                            retained as prisoners for almost a year. These men do not know why they
                            are permitted to be held to wait in an enemy's hands, without release or
                            exchange. They have been importuning their friends, and the members of
                            Congress, to use some affort to secure their release--and my heart has
                            wept over the recitals of some of their communications--and yet they
                            languish and rot in prison, retained in a climate unsuitable to their
                            health, confined in hateful and exposed places, with no music but the
                            prating of prison doers to greet them, and no solace but a consciousness
                            of rectitude and a faithful and patriotic performance of duty, with such
                            reflections as a remembrance of a distant home may furnish them.
                        These men left the pleasures and endearments of home, where existed one
                            hope, one affection, and hearts that beat as one. Led by the highest and
                            purest impulses and emotions of patriotism, they threw down personal
                            comfort at the feet of public duty, and taking life and heart in hand,
                            hastened to meet a nation's foe. They went forth at a time when the old
                            vessel of State, bearing in its bosom the precious freights of human
                            hopes, liberty, free Government, and the seeds of a Christian present
                            and future, was driven on tumultuous waves and shaken by the lightning
                            and red right hand of war, until the shock almost shattered her from her
                            masthead to the. water's edge. Shall we let these men pine and fester
                            for mere want of a human, just and speedy exchange of prisoners? Shall
                            we be voiceless in the midst of such complaints? Or shall we carry the
                            echo of the prison walls to Washington? The soldier forsakes his ease at
                            home, casts away his pleasures, endures the hardships and burdens of a
                            soldier's life, perils his health and existence, and defies death and a
                            yawning grave to preserve whole and unstained a nation's flag.
                        Our soldiers have done their duty, and it is left for us to do ours. They
                            have kept eye and heart upon our country's cause. As


                        
                            "The sun flower turns to her God when he sets The
                                same face that she did when he rose."
                        
                        And it is our duty as men to seek the amelioration of the conditions of
                            war, and endeavor to secure a speedy exchange. Humanity, a Christian
                            spirit, our duty to the soldiers dictate that those having the control
                            of the question of exchange should provide for a speedy release of the
                            captives taken by the fortunes of war. If we desire a steady adhesion,
                            and enthusiasm in our cause, and a disposition on the part of the
                            soldiery to return to the field after the termination of their term of
                            enlistment, we must not be listless to their call, as it echoes to us
                            from the prison wall. I am unable to say what is the cause of this
                            lameness in making exchanges, cannot indicate the party or department at
                            fault, but it is evident some one is neglectful of his duty, for the
                            brave men of our army could not lie in prison for one and two years
                            without exchange, unless there was some grossness in that department. I
                            move that the joint resolution be read the second time now.
                        Mr. DUNNING moved to refer it to the Military
                                Committee.
                        Mr. HORD objected to the delay of a reference, and urged the immediate
                            passage of his resolution. He moved to lay the motion to refer on the
                            table, but withdrew that motion at the request of several Senators.
                        Mr. OYLER, while reciprocating to the fullest extent the feelings
                            expressed by the Senator from Bartholomew, [Mr. Herd,] thought it well
                            not to act hastily in this matter. We are too much in the habit of
                            asking others to do that which we are not willing to do ourselves. This
                            remark was made for the purpose of calling the attention of Senators to
                            the abstract fact that we are far removed from the seat of government,
                            and unacquainted with the circumstances connected with the action of our
                            officials concerning the exchange of prisoners, and we had better travel
                            slowly and surely. While realizing that the state of the lone prisoner
                            is one demanding our earnest aid, he would not lose sight of the fact
                            that ever and always it has been the fate of soldiers to be sacrificed
                            for the general good of the cause they espouse. He yielded to no man in
                            intense sympathy for our brave soldiers, and especially that class whose
                            unfortunate fate has been to suffer the outrages poured upon their
                            devoted heads by a cruel and relentless foe. He was not prepared to say,
                            but that the spirit of the resolution was correct, and that he should be
                            found ready to support it with his vote, but it certainly ought to go to
                            an appropriate committee, where the language should be revised, and if
                            there is aught in the resolution that will militate against the past
                            action of the Government unless we are fully advised that action is
                            wrong, we ought to be very careful about leaving it in.
                        Mr. THOMPSON would like to see the resolution contain all the facts
                            pertaining to the case. He sympathized deeply with the spirit cf the
                            resolution, but it does not state all the facts. It should state that
                            "Whereas?, the officers and soldiers of the American Union have been
                            captured by rebels in arms against the country, and thrown in prisons
                            and starved by these rebels in arms, with a view of destroying their
                            lives; therefore, resolved," &c. He would like to see the resolution
                            embrace these fact? [and others he mentioned.] He would like to see this
                            resolution go up with all the moral force our acts can give it.
                        Mr. COBB. This resolution was introduced for the purpose of doing some
                            good, and it would be productive of no good to go on and portray the
                            evils that we have eard have been heaped upon our, prisoners as
                            suggested by the gentleman from Marion [Mr. Thompson ]--They have been
                            badly treated, no doubt of that, and if he could seize hold of the
                            parties be would deal with them heavily--very heavily; but he could only
                            speak the voice of one who sympathizes with our mistreated soldiers. He
                            thought a tirade of passion would amount to nothing. He suggested that
                            the resolution should be couched in language that will com-  mend it to the wisdom, sympathy and virtue
                            of every roan.
                        Mr. DUNNING wanted the Senator to point out wherein the system of
                            exchange is tame and defective.
                        Mr. COBB. Many complaints have been made in regard to the exchange of
                            prisoners. He understood that at one time the exchange of white soldiers
                            could not take place except upon condition that the negro soldiers
                            should be exchanged too.
                        Mr. CASON would like to ask the gentleman if at any time that question
                            alone prevented the exchange of prisoners ?
                        Mr. COBB understood that was the main question. It was the leading
                            question. There may have been some other preliminaries, but at one time
                            that was one of the conditions upon which the cessation of exchanges of
                            prisoners took place.
                        Mr. DUNNING objected to the phrase in the resolution which characterizes
                            the system for the exchange of prisoners is a lame and defective one. It
                            comes with an ill grace from any Senator to make such a charge, unless
                            it can be pointed out where the system is defective. When he read the
                            revolting accounts of the sufferings of Federal prisoners, he had wished
                            almost that God Almighty would clothe him with power to strike from
                            existence the men who so mistreat our soldiers. He thanked God he never
                            had a feeling of sympathy for such men, and trusted he never should. And
                            he would not be mean enough to accuse any Senator here of entertaining
                            any feelings of that kind. No one would vote with more cheerfulness than
                            he for anything that would ameliorate the condition of our soldiers. He
                            insisted that his motion to refer the resolution to the
                                Military Committee should prevail.
                        Mr. NILES said he hoped the resolution would be referred to the
                            committee. It is our duty to treat our Government with respect, and it
                            is the one of the evils of the times that we sometimes forget that duty.
                            This Senate, he was safe in saying, are unanimous in a desire to see our
                            prisoners exchanged, but he desired that the resolution might be
                            prudently expressed, and calculated not to weaken, but to uphold the
                            hands of our National Executive.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS thought if the resolution will do any good, it should be
                            hastened on its mission. If we pass it to-night, it might be partially
                            the means of rescuing some of our prisoners 24 hours sooner. He was sure
                            there was no language in it but that expressed what he believed to be
                            true.
                        Mr. CORBIN insisted that we should urge upon Congress immediate and
                            speedy action upon this matter. Forty to fifty thousand of our brave men
                            are now incarcerated in Southern prisons, and he believed it was in the
                            power of our Government to release them. He saw no necessity of
                            referring the resolution to a committee, for there is nothing in it that
                            any one could take offense at.
                        Mr. CASON, taking the various opinions of gentlemen on this question, and
                            looking to what they understood to be the facts in the case, was fully
                            sustained in the view that this resolution should be referred to the
                            Committee. We should not do anything that will make us appear foolish in
                            the eyes of Congress, nor in the eyes of the world. This resolution
                            starts out by saying that there is something lame in the system for the
                            exchange of prisoners, and yet there is not a Senator who can point out
                            where the exchange system is lame.
                        Mr. CORBIN asked whether the exchange of prisoners was not stopped
                            because the North insisted on the recognition of negroes as
                            soldiers?
                        Mr. CASON did not suppose there was a well-informed man on this question
                            outside of the rebel government, that believed such a thing; and was
                            surprised that any gentleman here should take such a view of that
                            question.
                        Mr. CORBIN asked whether at one time the exchange of prisoners was not
                            stopped in consequence of the Government placing a man there they knew
                            was odious to the South?
                        Mr. CASON. That shows what information where prejudice will carry them.
                            The ex-gentlemen have on this question-it shows change of prisoners was
                            stopped long before Gen. Butler had anything to do with it. It struck
                            him with astonishment to see men get up here and charge a lameness on
                            this subject on the part of our Government? Does any man doubt the
                            sympathy and kindness of heart and goodness of the President or of
                            Secretary Stanton? Gentlemen know this question has received the
                            consideration of these men from the beginning of the war.
                        Mr. HANNA moved to lay the motion to refer on the table.
                        The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken,
                            resulted--yeas 21, nays 21--as follows:

                                        and Williams-21.
                                    NAYS-Messrs. Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Brown, of Hamilton,
                                        Cason, Chapman, Culver, Davis, Dunning, Milligan, Niles,
                                        Noyes, Oyler, Peden, Richmond, Terry, Thompson, Van Buskirk,
                                        Ward Woods, and Wright-21.
                                
                            
                        
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The duty of giving the casting vote devolving
                            upon me, I will state my reasons for the vote I shall give. In the first
                            place, I received a letter from a distinguished officer in the army, a
                            few days ago in reference to this question. The soldiers of Colonel
                            Straight's command have been exchanged, but the officers are still held,
                            on the ground, as the rebels say, that we treat General Morgan's men and
                            officers with undue regard; and I desire that a special reference be
                            made in this joint resolution to the officers of the 51st and 73d
                            Indiana regiments, because they have been held as prisoners of war
                            longer than others. Another thing is, I don't believe there is anything
                            defective in the system, for it is based on the cartel of 1812 and on
                            the laws of nations. The system is good, but the difficulty is, the
                            rebels won't carry out the system. I therefore vote against laying the
                            motion to refer on the table.
                        Pending the call--
                        Mr. CULLEN announced that he had paired off on all political questions
                            with Mr. Finch.
                        Mr. ENGLISH asked and obtained leave of absence for Mr. Bradley till
                            to-morrow.
                        
                        Mr. VAWTER obtained leave of absence for Mr. Allison--sick--and stated
                            that they had paired on all political questions.
                        So the motion to lay the motion to refer on the table was rejected.
                        The joint resolution was then referred to the Committee on
                                Military Affairs, by consent.
                    




                    
                        MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR.
                        His Excellency sent to the Senate the following messages in writing by
                            the hand of his private Secretary, B. R, Sulgrove, Esq.: 
                        
                        

                        
                            
                                


                                    
                                        To the Senate and House of Representatives of
                                            the Legislature of Indiana:
                                    

                                    It is my duty to call your attention to the necessity of
                                        providing secure offices for the deposits and preservation
                                        of the papers and public records of the State. The offices
                                        of the Secretary, Treasurer and Auditor of State are kept in
                                        the lower story of McOuatt's building, on Kentucky Avenue.
                                        This building is four stones high, the three upper stories
                                        being occupied by lodgers, each of whom, it is fair to
                                        presume, keeps a fire. The dangers arising from fire in a
                                        building thus occupied, is much greater even than in a large
                                        hotel over which their is a general supervisory care. The
                                        building is not fire-proof, and is, of course, exposed to
                                        danger by the burning of other houses by which it is closely
                                        surrounded. The records in the offices of the Auditor and
                                        Secretary of State are invaluable. If destroyed, more than
                                        one-half of them could not be replaced, and the rest could
                                        only be restored after great labor and expense. 
                                    It is therefore a matter of great importance that speedy
                                        steps be taken to procure a safe and suitable building in
                                        which the State offices may be kept, and I respectfully
                                        invite your attention to the subject.
                                    
                                         O. P. MORTON, Governor of
                                                Indiana.
                                    
                                
                            
                        


                        The other message transmits to the Senate the proceedings of a meeting
                            recently held at Richmond, in Wayne county, and a resolution thereof
                            guaranteeing the sum of $100,000 to aid in the establishment of a State
                            Agricultural College, if Richmond shall be selected as the place for its
                            location; to which the Governor adds the following:
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Richmond is a beautiful and flourishing city, distinguished
                                        or its healthfulness, and situated in a fertile and highly
                                        cultivated county. The offer made to the State must be
                                        admitted to be generous, and is entitled to your
                                        consideration, among others that have been, or may hereafter
                                        be made, and the character of the gentlemen from whom it
                                        comes, is a sufficient assurance that it will be made good,
                                        if accepted.
                                    
                                        O. P. MORTON,
                                         Governor of Indiana.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    


                    
                         CLAIMS OF DECEASED SOLDIERS.
                        Mr. BONHAM introduced a joint resolution [S. 15,] instructing our
                            Senators and requesting our Representatives in Congress to use their
                            influence for the bringing about of a speedy adjustment of the claims of
                            deceased soldiers; which was read the first time.
                    


                    
                         FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES.
                        Mr. BEESON offered the following, which was adopted. He said the object
                            was to get the subject of insurance before a special committee, whose
                            duty it shall be to examine that question, from the fact that the law,
                            as it now stands, puts the people of Indiana at the mercy of
                            irresponsible parties, and without a remedy:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, The laws now in force in the
                                        State of Indiana on the subject of Insurance Companies need
                                        such general revision as will protect the people of the
                                        State against fraud and irresponsible organizations;
                                        therefore be it

                                    Resolved by the Senate, (the House
                                        concurring therein,) That a committee of three be appointed
                                        on behalf of the Senate, to act in conjunction with a like
                                        committee on behalf of the House to whom all bids now
                                        introduced, or that may be hereafter introduced upon that
                                        subject, shall be referred, and that said committee is
                                        hereby instructed to examine the laws now in force relative
                                        to Insurance Companies and report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    


                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time, and passed to
                            the second reading except in the cases stated.

                     HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        TUESDAY, January 31, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed a call of the
                        roll, which proceeded, and when it was ascertained, that the Clerk had
                        reported a quorum present, and answering to their names-
                    The journals of Friday and yesterday were read and approved.
                    The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from the Hon. Thomas  Resident Trustee of the Wabash and
                        Erie Canal accompanied with the annual report of the Board of Trustees
                        thereof.
                     Mr. MEREDITH moved that it lie on the table, and that the usual number of
                        copies be printed.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK said he had before stated that there was a law requiring the
                        printing of the annual reports of the State officers, and he believed also
                        that the report of these Trustees was included. If the gentleman from
                        Tippecanoe could allow the report to lie on the table, he would undertake to
                        find the law referred to. 
                    Mr. MEREDITH acquiesced.
                    So the report lies on the table.

                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY presented the memorial of a committee appointed by a
                            convention of newspaper publishers, which met in this city January 18,
                            1865, representing the necessity of increased legal rates for notices
                            and advertisements required by law to be printed in the newspapers of
                            the State; and considerations in favor of publishing the laws and the
                            proceedings of the county commissioners in the local newspapers,
                            &c.
                        On motion of Mr. BONNER, it was referred to the Committee on
                                Rights and Privileges.
                        Mr. STEWART presented the petition of Thos. C. Hill, with reference to a
                            more efficient system of apprenticeship for indigent children; which was
                            referred to the Committee en Rights and
                            Privileges.
                        Mr. BRANHAM presented the memorial of N. Field, representing informality
                            and illegality in the extension of the town plot of Jeffersonville, and
                            asking for the exemption from taxation of a lot of land on the north of
                            Ninth street in said extension of said town plot; which was referred to
                            the Committee on County and Township Business.
                        Mr. STRINGER presented a temperance memorial, which (without reading,)
                            was referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB presented the memorial of sundry citizens of Lawrenceburg,
                            with reference to the levy and collection of taxes in cities of less
                            than seven thousand inhabitants; which was referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                    

                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            returned Mr. Grove's bill [H. R. No. 10,] to amend the act prescribing
                            the compensation of Township Assessors, without amendment, and
                            recommending its passage; which (under the rule) lies on the table.
                    


                    
                         POLL TAX EXEMPTION.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tipoecanoe, from the Committee on Ways and
                                Means, to whom was referred the resolution and petition
                            for exempting from the poll tax persons in the military service of the
                            United States during their term of service, returned the same, reporting
                            the expression of opinion, that legislation is expedient thereon,
                            provided the same is constitutional; they, therefore, ask that the
                            petition be referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                    
                    
                         COUNTY WAR BONDS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Select Committee to whom was referred the
                                Judiciary Committee's bill, [H. R., No. 70]
                            returned the game with sundry amendments; and, when so amended,
                            recommending the passage of the bill.
                        Mr. BROWN, from the minority of said Select Committee, submitted a
                            minority report, recommending a substitute for the bill-similar in its
                            provisions to the amendment to the bill offered last week by Mr.
                            Dunham.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved that the two reports be laid on the table and
                            printed.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB opposed the motion to print, preferring immediate action.
                        Mr. CHURCH had no idea that any such bill would pass, and for this
                            reason, as well as the expense, he hoped the motion would not
                            prevail.
                        Mr. BURNES hoped the bills would be printed, to enable members to act
                            upon them intelligently.
                        Mr. BROWN thought it was too late for these propositions to benefit the
                            State or affect it in any way in connection with the February draft.
                            Besides, he thought delay would promote volunteering. He therefore
                            advised printing.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB stated, that the principal amendment submitted by the
                            majority was to strike out "300," and insert "100" as the maximum
                            limitation of local bounties. The remaining amendments were chiefly in
                            consequence of that; and the House could just as well determine upon
                            that modification now as at any future time.
                        Mr. BROWN. The majority report proposes to restrict county and city
                            bounties to one hundred dollars; whilst the minority report prohibits
                            counties-and cities from giving bounties; establishing and authorizing
                            all bounties on the credit and by the authority of the State. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The gentleman misunderstood him. We could test the question
                            in five minutes, whether the House is in favor of local bounties; and if
                            so, the question is, how much? Then in regard to the choice between the
                            two propositions submitted, that also could be indicated at once. He was
                            glad to hear that Brown county was volunteering.
                        Mr. CHURCH said that in his county and the counties adjoining,
                            volunteering was never progressing more rapidly than at present.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB supposed that volunteering was stimulate by the local
                            bounties. He urged immediated action to stop this cut-throat system. He
                            regretted that action on this subject had been so long delayed.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. Any bill involving taxation should be well guarded. Popular
                            clamor might prove to be popular folly. He urged printing.
                        Mr. BOYD desired printing because he was not yet prepared to vote on
                            these propositions.  Then there was
                            a proposition to legalize all local bounties, and there was the bill of
                            the House, No. 14, for the relief of soldiers' families, that should be
                            considered first, or they should be considered together with this
                            subject.
                        The motion to print was agreed to.
                        So the reports, bill and amendments lie on the table.
                    


                    
                         LAKE COUNTY SCHOOL LANDS.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the  Committee on
                                Education, to whom was referred Mr. Wood's bill [H. R. 22]
                            to legalize the sale of certain school lands in Lake county, reported it
                            back to the House without amendment, and with a recommendation that the
                            bill ought to be passed.
                        It lies on the table under the rule. 
                    
                    
                        GERMAN LANGUAGE IN THE COMMON SCHOOLS.
                        Mr. GREGORY, from the same Committee, to whom was
                            referred the petition of sundry German citizens of Alien county,
                            (presented by Mr. Shoaff,) asking the Legislature to consider the
                            propriety of establishing free German Schools in this State, similar to
                            those of Ohio and Pennsylvania, submitted a report against the prayer of
                            the petition, for the reason that the Committee deem it inexpedient to
                            have two established systems of Common Schools.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved to re-commit the petition to the same
                            Committee, with instructions to consider the propriety of so amending
                            the Common School law as to admit of the employment of teachers of the
                            German language in our common schools.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to-affirmative 52, negative 20.
                        So the subject was recommitted.
                    
                    
                        THE SABBATH DAY.
                        Mr. BURNES, from the Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges, to whom was referred the resolution directing
                            said Committee to inquire and report coccerning a more effectual
                            protection of the Sabbath day, returned the same to the House, with a
                            motion, that it be laid on the table, the Committee deeming legislation
                            thereon inexpedient at this time.
                        The report wes concurred in.
                    
                    
                        STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.
                        Mr. HOGATE, from the Committee on Agriculture, to whom
                            was referred his State Board Agricultural bill, [H. R. 20] returned the same
                            without amendment, and recommended its passage.
                        The report lies on the table.
                    
                    
                        RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE EXECUTIVE
                            DEPARTMENT.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, from the majority of the Joint Special Committee of the two
                            Houses appointed for the purpose of examining the vouchers respecting
                            the receipts and expenditures of money by the Governor of the State,
                            submitted a report in detail, to the following effect:
                        
                            The Committee find the books and vouchers all
                                correct, and great care in the disbursement of money borrowed and
                                received to carry on the State Government and protect the public
                                interest. They find the Government chargeable with $1,026,321 31
                                received from various sources. He has disbursed, as shown by the

                        The $250,000 furnished the Governor by the General Government, as a
                            disbursing officer, is not wholly provided for. And also the $135,000
                            due to counties and corporations, for the purpose of carrying on the
                            benevolent institutions, &c.
                        There is due from the General Government to the State, as shown by the
                            proper vouchers on file, $133,302 91, which with the balance of cash now
                            on hand would over pay the amount due the General Government.
                        This would leave the amount used for carrying on the Benevolent
                            Institutions unprovided for; but this committee would make the following
                            recommendations:
                        
                            That the $250,000 received from the General
                                Government be assumed by the State, and the amount placed to the
                                credit of the General Government; and any claims the State now has
                                or may have in the future, will be a legal effect against this
                                amount; and that the $135,000 borrowed from counties, corporations
                                and individuals, be paid out of the Treasury of the State, including
                                interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum, from the date of
                                receipt to the date of repayment of the same. That the amount ot
                                $124,256 24, now in the hands of the Governor, be paid over to the
                                Treasurer of State, to be placed to the credit of the general
                                fund.
                        
                        
                            We further recommend that all books, vouchers and
                                claims be handed over by the Governor to the Auditor of State, for
                                preservation and reference as to the finances of the State so far as
                                carried on by the Governor: and that the same be recognized as the
                                act of the State; and that the State relieve the Governor from any
                                further liability after paying over the funds now in his hands.
                        
                        
                            The Committee cannot complete this report without
                                expressing their entire satisfaction as to the manner and ability
                                with which this department has been conducted, under the control of
                                the Financial Secretary, Colonel W. H. H. Terrell. The system of
                                vouchers adopted by him for the expenditures of the Benevolent
                                Institutions, Prisons, &c., are more full and complete than they
                                have ever before been and we respectfully recommend that those
                                institutions be required to use the same forms in future.
                        
                        
                            By request of the Governor, the Committee have
                                inquired of the Banks where the Governor kept the deposits of the
                                State, and find that interest on the deposits has not been allowed
                                to him, either direct or indirectly.
                        
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the report be laid on the table and printed.
                        Mr. HUMPHREYS, on the part of the minority of said joint special
                            committee, asked and obtained further time till to-morrow to submit a
                            minority report on the same subject.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the report so as to authorize the printing
                            of both reports.
                        Mr. BRNHAAM accepted. 
                        So the two reports were ordered to be laid on the table and printed.
                    
                    
                         DOG LAW.
                        Mr. COLLINS, from the special committee whom was referred Mr. Shoaff of
                            Allen's dog bill [H. R. 8],
                            reported the same back to he House, with sundry amendments, recommending
                            its passage. 
                        The bill and report lie on the table under the rule.
                    
                    
                        LIQUOR LAW.
                        Mr. KILGORE introduced a bill, [H. R 93 ] for an act to regulate and
                            license the sale of spirituous, vinous, malt and other intoxicating
                            liquors, &c.; to repeal all former laws on this subject, and
                            providing punishment for the violation of this act.
                        Mr. SHUEY moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance.
                        Mr. KILGORE proposed to add to the motion an amendment to print 300
                            copies:
                        Which was agreed to; and then the bill was referred.
                    
                    
                        LOCAL BOUNTIES.
                        Mr. MILROY presented the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved  That the Judiciary Committee he
                                        instructed to report back the Senate bill, No. 23,
                                        instanter, for the action of the House.
                                
                            
                        
                        He said the whole State demanded immediate action upon this bill. It was
                            a bill to legalize the action of county boards in regard to
                            bounties.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said the gentleman was mistaken in regard to the scope of the
                            bill.- He stated the cause of delay in the committee.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to make the resolution merely directory to the
                            committee.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK and Mr. BOYD gave reasons for demanding immediate action on
                            this bill.
                        Mr. BROWN defended the committee from imputations of delay. The committee
                            had considered the bill, and were not ready to report.
                        The amendment was agreed to, and so the resolution was adopted.
                    


                    
                         ACTION UNDER RULE 58.


                        Mr. HENRICKS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Speaker be now
                                        instructed to take from his table all the bills that may
                                        have been once read, in the order in which they were read,
                                        so that they may be referred in accordance with the rule 58,
                                        as now amended,
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                        Whereupon,
                        The SPEAKER directed the execution of the order.
                        Mr. Higgins's joint resolution No. 8, for the removal of John Blissford
                            to the Insane Asylum, coming up-
                        Mr. HIGGINS stated that he understood that Blissford had gone into the
                            army; and there-fore he would move that the joint resolution be laid on
                            the table.
                        The resolution was agreed to.
                        Mr. Thacher's joint resolution No. 9, coming up-
                        Mr. THACHER, understanding that Congress has already acted on the subject
                            contemplated in the resolution, [repeal of duty on printing paper,] it
                            had better also go to the table.
                        It was accordingly laid on the table.
                        The bills of the House of Representatives, numbered respectively 25, 27,
                            28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49,
                            50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 53, 60 and 61 were read by title
                            respectively, and referred to appropriate committees.
                        Mr. Whiteside's railroad bill, [H. R. 48,] coming up-he asked and
                            obtained leave to withdraw it from the files.
                        The joint resolution No. 10 was referred to the Committee on
                                Military Affairs; No. 11 to the Committee on
                                Swamp Lands.
                        Mr. Coffroth's bill, [H. R. 61,] requiring Court Clerks to index their
                            records, coming up-
                        Mr. ------ proposed an amendment which he sent to the table, and (without
                            reading,) it was ordered to be referred, with the bill, to the Judiciary
                            Committee.
                        Mr. BROWN. What becomes of the amendment?
                        The SPEAKER. The chair understands that under the amended rule,
                            amendments are offered, and go to the commitiee without reading.
                        Mr. BROWN. Has the bill been read the second time? I have just come in to
                            my place.
                        The SPEAKER. No, sir. Bills that have been read but once are being read
                            by title for information of the House and reference.
                        The bills of the House numbered 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74.
                            75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93-
                            heretofore described
                        And bills from the Senate numbered 27, 4, 11 and 14; and joint
                            resolutions of the Senate numbered 5 and 10, heretofore described in
                            these reports, were each read by title and referred.
                        
                        On the motion of Mr. WRIGHT, the order of business was
                            suspended--affirmative 47, negative 23--and the House took up the
                            consideration of bills on the third reading.
                        Mr. BROWN moved an adjournment; but gave way for business.
                    


                    
                         HARBOR AT MICHIGAN CITY.
                        

                        Mr. Higgin'a bill [H. R. 7] to
                            amend the first section of the act to amend the second section of the
                            act concerning the organization of voluntary associations, passed
                            February 12, 1855, so as to authorize ferry companies, (approved
                            February 16, 1857.) so as to authorize the construction and repairs of
                            the Harbor at Michigan City, on Lake Michigan, and other navigable
                            waters, and to assess and collect tolls for the use thereof,-coming up
                            on the third reading-
                        Mr. HIGGINS said the passage of the bill had been recommended by
                            committee, and moved that it be considered as engrossed.
                        The bill was then read the third time by the Clerk.
                        
                        Mr. LASSELLE thought the bill proposed local and special legislation,
                            which is prohibited by the Constitution.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. The object of the bill is, simply to authorize an
                            association to be formed to construct a harbor at Michigan City. It
                            might not be used in any other place than Michigan City, but it was
                            still, in ail its provisions, a general act.
                        

                        The bill was passed the final reading in the House of Representatives, by
                            yeas 72, nays 2.

                        On motion of Mr. GRIFFITH, (the regular order of business being further
                            suspended for the purpose,) his joint resolution [H. R. No. 12,] for Congressional
                            instruction to extend 5 years of time to the Grand Rapids and Indiana
                            Railroad Company, was taken up, considered as engrossed, and passed the
                            final reading in the House of Representatives--yeas 74, nays 0.

                         THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGES 
                        Received yesterday afternoon, were referred the first one to the
                                Committee on Finance, and the second to the
                                Select Committee heretofore appointed on that
                            subject.
                    

                    
                         A HARBOR AT MICHIGAN CITY.
                        The bill H. R. 7, see page 41 of
                            these Reports, was read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        GRAND RAPIDS AND INDIANA RAILROAD.


                        The joint resolution H. R. 12,
                            see page 111 of these Reports, was read the first time, and,
                        On motion by Mr. WARD, it was read the second time. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, stated that the company had already a sufficient
                            amount of land granted to them to build the road, and an extension of
                            time was all that is desired. The project was one of considerable
                            importance to the northern part of the State.
                        
                        On his motion, the joint resolution was read the third time, and finally
                            passed by yeas 39. nays 0. 
                        
                    
                    
                         THE SECOND READING.
                        Senate bills 93 and 99, see pages 110 and 118, and the joint resolution
                            15, introduced yesterday, were read the second time and ordered
                            engrossed for the third reading.
                    


                    
                         PUBLIC PARKS, &C.
                         Mr. NILES submitted the following report:
                        
                        
                         MR. PRESIDENT: The Judiciary
                                Committee,to whom was referred Senate Bill No. 34,
                            authorizing cities to purchase lands for fair grounds parks, &c.,
                            report that they fully approve the bill, except only that provision
                            limiting the quantity of land which cities may purchase to twenty
                            acres.
                         The committee are of opinion that no such limitation should be
                            incorporated in the bill; but, on the contrary, that facilities should
                            be afforded by law to every city in the State to procure ample grounds
                            for the purposes indicated.
                        
                         Next after sunny and well ventilated dwellings, thorough drainage, and
                            pure waters, there is no one thing of a merely physical nature, which
                            contributes more essentially to the health, cheerfulness, good order and
                            general well-being of the inhabitants of a city than large and well
                            regulated public grounds. The opportunities afforded by public parks for
                            pleasant walks and drives, and for enjoying the sunshine and open air,
                            would alone justify any reasonable expense in their purchase. But in
                            such grounds, wherever they exist, all classes, the rich and poor, the
                            learned and the ignorant, the old and the young, are habitually brought
                            together. Such association always tends to remove prejudices, and to
                            induce feelings of mutual kindness and respect.
                         It is much to be regretted that our cities have neglected the most
                            favorable opportunities for purchasing such grounds. At any time, during
                            many years, a park containing hundreds of acres might have been
                            procured, near Indianapolis for example, at a very modest cost. Such a
                            park, covered with our native forest tress, the growth of centuries and
                            more beautiful than any trees which can be cultivated by the art of man,
                            would be an invaluable boon to posterity. Our forests, near to cities,
                            have been mostly destroyed and the loss can never be fully supplied. And
                            so far from sufficient public grounds having been provided, it is
                            noticeable that, in most cases, our cities are extended, the streets are
                            made narrower and the lots smaller.
                         It is useless to complain of the past, except as we learn wisdom from
                            its experience; but it is to be hoped that the duty of providing ample
                            grounds for public resort and recreation will no longer be neglected.
                            The want of them is not greatly felt now, in our comparative infancy as
                            a people, and their full benefit may not be experienced by the present
                            generation, but their value to coming ages will be above price.
                         Your Committee trust that the bill under consideration with the proposed
                            amendment may be useful in accomplishing this much desired end.
                        The Committee recommended the passage of the bill with an amendment
                            striking out the words limiting the number of acres.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    

                    
                        TOWNSHIP ASSESSORS.
                        On motion by Mr. RICHMOND the bill [S.
                                100] fixing the pay of township assessors at $2 50 a day was
                            taken from the table.
                        Mr. MOORE moved team end by striking out "$2 50" and inserting ''$2."
                        Messrs. BROWN, of Wells, RICHMOND, VAN BUSKIRK and BENNETT spoke briefly
                            in opposition to the amendment, and Messrs. COBB and MOORE in favor of
                            it. 
                        
                        The amendment was rejected by yeas 9, nays 31, and the bill was ordered
                            to be engrossed for the third reading.

                        On motion by Mr. HANNA the bill [S.
                                68] giving further time for the completion of the Terre Haute
                            & Richmond Railroad, and authorizing the company to change its
                            corporate name, was taken from the table and ordered to be engrossed for

                                    WHEREAS, The spittoons now in use in the
                                        Senate Chamber are of such light material that they are very
                                        easily upset, which is constantly being done by  members and officers of the
                                        Senate, causing a rattling noise which is very annoying to
                                        persons inside of the Senate Chamber, to say nothing of the
                                        saliva strewn on the carpet, therefore
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper be

                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the resolution adopted by consent, in
                            the midst of considerable merriment,
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                            State House, and recommended that, the same be placed in the specific

                        Mr. MEREDITH, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                Institutions, submitted & report on the management and

                            additional buildings for the Hospital for the Insane, to cost $90,000;
                            and for the completion and support of these institutions, a tax of 15

                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Select Committee
                            created under his resolution, with reference to the copyright of Gavin

                            revision.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved that the report be laid on the table.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to refer it to the Committee on the

                        It was so ordered.
                    
                    
                        RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE EXECUTIVE
                            DEPARTMENT.
                        Mr. HUMPHREYS, on the part of the minority of the joint Special
                                Committee on the Receipts and Expenditures of the Executive
                                Department, submitted a report, summing up and closing as
                            follows:
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Owing to the phraseology of the resolution under which this
                                        Committee was appointed, we were only empowered to
                                        investigate the books, vouchers, &c., in the Bureau of
                                        Finance, and to report as to the correctness of the same.
                                        We, there fore; admit that From an inspection of said books
                                        and vouchers, it appears that the same have been correctly
                                        kept,yet we have no evidence of the fact, except said books
                                        and vouchers themselves. But while we concur in the majority
                                        report, as far as the books and vouchers are concerned, yet
                                        we wish it to be distinctly understood that we emphatically
                                        dissent from the recommendation contained in said majority
                                        report, to-wit: We are decidedly opposed to the assumption
                                        by the State of the $250,000 received by the Governor from
                                        the General Government. We are opposed to the refunding of
                                        the $135,000 borrowed by the Governor from counties,
                                        corporations, &c., with interest thereon from the date
                                        of receipt thereof to the date of repayment, for the reason
                                        that at the date of the receipt of said money the State had
                                        ample means in her Treasury to defray the expenses of the
                                        State Government, and all other legitimate expenses; that it
                                        was the duty of the Executive, when the last Legislature
                                        adjourned without having made the necessary appropriation,
                                        to convene that body in extra session, that the necessary
                                        funds might have been provided to enable the Governor to
                                        administer the financial affairs of the State according to
                                        law; whereas, we contend that the acts of the Executive
                                        herein are not only without the sanction of law, but are in
                                        our estimation direct and dangerous usurpations of power,
                                        unwarranted by the Constitution or any law of the State.
                                    We are further opposed to the recommendation that the
                                        Governor hand over to the Auditor of State all books,
                                        vouchers and claims in said financial bureau, and that the
                                        same be recognized as the act of the State; and we recommend
                                        that the Legislature of a dangerous and unwarranted
                                        precedent, which followed by future Executives, may result
                                        in overthrow of the legislative and judiciary, and which may
                                        place the liberties of the people and the entire control of
                                        the State Government in the hands of tyrants and
                                        usurpers.
                                    Wherefore we ask that the majority report herein be laid-on
                                        the table, and that this minority report be adopted in lieu
                                        thereof.

                                    Resolved, That all motions and resolutions

                                        motions and resolutions proposing remedies there- for,or relating to

                                        authorize the German language to be exclusively taught in
                                        certain common schools in this State, where there are a
                                        sufficient number of inhabitants entitled to the benefits ot
                                        the present school law to require it.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion of Mr. OLLEMAN, it was referred to the Committee on

                                    WHEREAS, The gentleman from Monroe county
                                        did on the 29th day of January make an unnecessary exposure
                                        ot the financial affairs of his and the members of this
                                        House, calculated to impair and injure their good credit
                                        with their landlords and boarding housekeepers; and whereas,
                                        the chairman on Committee of Ways and
                                            Means, instigated and moved by the devil, not
                                        having the fear of the landlords and boarding housekeepers
                                        before his eye, withheld the means necessary to sustain the
                                        good credit of the members of this House; therefore
                                    Resolved, That the member from Monroe and
                                        the member from Jefferson deserves the censure of this
                                        House.
                                
                            
                        


                        Mr. BURNES moved that it be referred to the city newspaper reporters.
                        Mr. BROWN insisted on the adoption and record of the resolution.
                        Mr. ZEIGLER moved to lay it on the table.
                        The motion was agreed to.

                            salaries of the Judges of the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts, and to
                            provide means for paying the same:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Fees and Salaries.
                    

                    
                         SOLDIERS' VOTE.
                        Mr. Speaker PETTIT (Mr. Boyd in the Chair) submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Constitution of the
                                        State, without amendment, gives ample power for providing,
                                        by law, for officers and soldiers of the State in the
                                        military service of the United States, (except those in the
                                        regular service of the United States or its allies,) to vote
                                        at all elections; and it is hereby made the duty of the
                                            Committee on Elections to report a
                                        bill which shall provide for their voting at such elections,
                                        and to punish all those who shall prevent, hinder or defraud
                                        them in the exercise of this right.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. PETTIT said he would not ask the House now to vote on this
                            resolution, but simply to let it lie on the table. Constitutional doubts
                            had been frequently expressed as to the question it raised--a question
                            involving plain matter of common justice. After a careful examination of
                            the constitution his mind was satisfied that, without amendment of the
                            constitution, it is competent for the General Assembly to confer the
                            right to vote upon all citizen soldiers of the State, except these
                            engaged in the regular service of the United States. He now moved to lay
                            the resolution on the table, proposing to call it up to-morrow or at
                            some future day of the session.
                        It was so ordered.

                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. ZEIGLER submitted a resolution to the effect that the committee on
                            Benevolent Institutions consider and report on the means of enlarging

                            acres, and not exceeding $15,000 in value:]
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                    

                    
                         MESSAGE DOCUMENTS.
                        Mr. KILGORE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the State Printer be
                                        instructed to print, for the use of the Governor and Members
                                        of the House of Representatives, 8,000 copies of such of the
                                        accompanying documents of the Governor's Message as have not
                                        been printed ; and that the State Librarian be directed to
                                        furnish each member of the House his proportion of the same,
                                        as fast as they may be furnished to him.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. MILLER proposed to amend, by requiring the documents furnished to be
                            enveloped and stamped.
                        Mr. BROWN thought the amendment was unnecessary. The stamps could be
                            supplied out of the $100 appropriated to each member for that
                            purpose.
                        The amendment was rejected, and then the resolution was adopted. 
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED.
                        
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, introduced a bill [H. R. 104,] for an act to
                            distribute the proceeds of the agricultural lands granted to the State
                            of Indiana by the Congress of the United States, among the several
                            colleges of the State.
                        Mr. LASSELLE introduced a bill [H. R. 105,] for an act to amend section.
                            46 of the act to provide a general system of common schools, &c ,
                            approved March 11, 1861: [to change the rule of taxation in regard to
                            property for school purposes.]
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to
                                Committee on Education.
                        Mr. COOK introduced a bill [H. R. 106,] for an act to authorize the
                            construction of warehouses for the storage, inspection and sale of
                            tobacco:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Manufactures and Commerce.
                        Mr. CHURCH introduced a bill, [H. R. 107] for an act to provide for the
                            number and meeting of Directors for consolidated railroad companies;
                            authorizing railroad companies to consolidate, and to increase their
                            stock, borrow money, &c.
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the 
                                Committee on Railroads.
                        Mr. PUETT introduced a bill [H. R. 108] for an act to amend the [1?]35th
                            rection of the act to repeal all general laws now in force for the
                            incorporation of cities, and to provide for the incorporation of cities,
                            &c., approved March 9, 1857.
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporation.
                        Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, introduced a bill [H. R. 109] for an act to amend
                            the valuation and assessment act, approved June 21, 1852:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on County and Township Business.
                    


                    
                        RELIEF OF THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB (the order of business being suspended for the purpose)
                            reported back Mr. Branham's bill [H. R.
                                14] for relief of the families of soldiers and seamen of the
                            State in the service of the United States, &c., with sundry
                            amendments from the Committee on the Judiciary, with a recommendation
                            that the bill pass, either with or without the reported amendments.
                        He also reported back with sundry amendments from the same committee the
                            bill [S. No. 3] legalizing local
                            bounties past, &c.
                        Which reports lie on the table under the rule.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, (the order of business being further suspended
                            for the purpose,) the House took up the consideration of Mr. Branham's
                            bill [H. R. 14] with the
                            amendments just reported from the Judiciary
                            Committee.
                        The amendments reported were considered in their order, being reported by
                            the Clerk.
                        Several of the committee's amendments were merely clerical, and were
                            adopted without a division.
                        The amendment making the tax for this purpose "four" instead of "five
                            mills," having been read by the Clerk
                        Mr. NEWCOMB explained that this 40 cents on the hundred dollars would
                            raise something over ten million dollars.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted a calculation on the estimate of 600
                            families to each county, to whom that five mills on the dollar would
                            hardly raise a fund sufficient for this purpose.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. There was another amendment limiting the disbursements to
                            those families having need. He would be content with "five mills," if
                            the House should so advise; but the Committee thought it best to start
                            on "four."
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Is it a perpetual pension?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. It is limited to 1865 and 1866.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        The amendment, that the provisions of the bill shall not apply to the
                            families of commissioned officers, except in the case of prisoners in
                            the hands of the enemy, during the period of their captivity,-being
                            read-
                        Mr. CHURCH was not certain but the wife could draw the pay of her husband
                            in such cases.
                        


                         Mr. WRIGHT suggested an amendment, excluding those receiving pension
                            from the General Government.
                        Mr. KILGORE suggested a provision-"if their necessities require it."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The general provisions of the bill would cover that.
                        The amendment of the Committee was adopted.
                        The next amendment of the Committee authorizing the County Commissioners
                            in their discretion to appoint a disbursing officer in each township,
                            &c., being read-
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The bill provides that the Township Trustee shall disburse
                            this money; but in case the Trustee be an unsuitable man, here is a
                            discretion.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        The amendment adding to section 7 a provision that the insane or invalid
                            child over twelve years shall be paid the same amount as the child under
                            that age, &c., being read-- 
                        It was agreed to.
                        Mr. WOODS proposed to further amend the 7th section by adding: ''And to
                            each child whose mother is dead $4 a month, and double to every child
                            that is left motherless:" but, at the request of members, he withheld it
                            till the committee's amendments should be disposed of.
                        The next amendment, adding to the 7th section a provision confining the
                            benefits of the bill "to those who have not otherwise a sufficient means
                            of support--to be ascertained by the disbursing officer"--being
                            read--
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, was decidedly opposed to putting these
                            benefits on the ground of charity.
                        Mr. BROWN put it on the ground of high duty to those fighting the battles
                            of our country. But whilst he was disposed to be liberal he was not
                            willing to oppress the people with taxation to extend relief when there
                            was no necessity. There were doubtless many in the military service
                            worth more money than a majority ot the members on this floor, and it
                            could not be expected of us to tax for the relief of those provided for
                            better than ourselves.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS was opposed to the amendment, especially the manner in which
                            the benefit was to be conferred. Before the soldiers' families could get
                            the benefit of the bill, they must make an exposure of their poverty. He
                            would put it on the ground of compensation. He showed that the families
                            of the most worthy soldiers would be neglected under this amendment.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, went back to the reason of the proposition. He
                            put it on the ground Of reason and public duty. The object was to
                            provide for the really needy. Had it not been for the necessities of the
                            case, the bill would not have come up at all.
                        Mr. STEWART disliked all descriminations in the bill. He showed that many
                            discriptions of property, as a costly house, did not provide the means
                            of living. It involved an expense to keep it up. The difficulty was, who
                            is to make this discrimination. He would have them all on an
                            equality.
                         Mr. BURWELL was opposed to the amendment. If the bill was for the
                            purpose of supplying the deficiency of pay, then its provision should
                            extend to all alike. The amendment makes it a charity, and not a duty.
                            An officer was to inquire into the condition of the applicant. This
                            provision should be for the benefit of the majority. Many a wife of a
                            worthy soldier would never make application.
                        Mr. BECKETT opposed the amendment. The soldier's property is taxed to
                            make up the fund. The amendment would increase applications for its
                            benefits.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH was in favor of the bill and the amendment. The object was
                            expressed in the title: "A bill for the relief of families of soldiers
                            and seamen." It was not an act of charity, but an act of relief. He
                            hoped the amendment would be adopted, end the bill would go through on a
                            double quick.
                        On motion of Mr. LOCKHART, it was ordered that the House hold an
                            afternoon session this day. 
                        The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M. 
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        WEDNESDAY, February 1, 1865,AFTERNOON SESSION.
                    
                    The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at 2 o'clock P. M,, and stated the question to
                        be on the Committee's amendment to the 7th section of the bill, adding, "who
                        have not otherwise sufficient means for a eomfo1 table support--to be
                        ascertained by the disbursing officer.'
                    Mr. WHITESIDE saw that in the amendment which was against the spirit of the
                        bill. The spirit of the bill was to do a public duty to men in the field.
                        The amendment was to make those families, not having the means of a
                        comfortable support, mere beneficiaries of this fund. He stood by the
                        soldier. They all fought for the same object, and he stood here to prevent
                        discriminations between them. He showed how the object of the bill might
                        fail, (if the amendment prevail,) in the hands of dishonest and partial
                        trustees. It seemed to him as though this amendment might have been drawn
                        expressly to defeat the bill. He was distinctly friendly to the bill.
                    Mr. KILGORE'S sentiments were forcibly expressed by the gentleman from
                        Wabash.
                    Mr. FERRIS. If gentlemen were so much opposed to discrimination, why not say
                        the provisions of the bill shall extend to those having no family? He was
                        for the amendment.
                    Mr. WOODS opposed the amendment. If the State would do a public benefit, let
                        it be done gracefully and generously.
                    Mr. COFFROTH. A stranger might conclude from this debate that a large portion
                        of members here were Copperheads. The general Government provides for its
                        soldiers; it does not call on us for that. Good qualities were variously
                        distributed amongst soldiers as other men, and it was impossible to equalize
                        the condition of their families. He showed the fact that the soldier gets
                        $840 a year; and if his family is to be provided for, the military becomes
                        the most profitable of ordinary public employments. Did gentlemen consider
                        that this single bill proposes a tax nearly double the amount of that
                        required for the entire civil  expenses
                        of the State? With reference to the amendment, he asked, was it right that a
                        family living in opulence should be aided at such a cost to the people?
                    Mr. BRANHAM had considered this matter, and determined to leave it as in the
                        original bill. He thought also that exemptions would be wrong. Nine-tenths
                        of the men in the field have not received any home bounty. He hoped the
                        amendment would not prevail, but should vote for the bill any how.
                    Mr. EMERSON thought, if this amendment were adopted, the bill should not have
                        the title for the benefit of the soldiers' families, but it would be a bill
                        for the benefit of the poor. If we tax the property of men in the field for
                        this purpose, let all the soldiers' families have the benefit alike.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. If, as it had been said, this was a bill to increase the pay of
                        soldiers, he was opposed to it. But he regarded it as a proposition to
                        relieve suffering. He did not call it charity, though he favored the
                        amendment. Every man owed the Government a doubly interested duty in time of
                        war-to secure protection for his person and protection for his property. The
                        amendment proposes relief to those with insufficient living.
                    Mr. CHURCH. Was there not danger that this money would be distributed
                        unequally?
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. The danger was, perhaps, that the bill would have too liberal a
                        construction as to disbursements. He considered that this bill was to take
                        the place of the act of 1861, which authorized County Commissioners to tax
                        for this relief-it was to make it a State matter instead of a local one. He
                        showed how enormously the taxation would have to be raised from $1 to $1 50
                        and $2 on the hundred dollars. Whatever is needed we ought to give.
                    Mr. CHAMBERS proposed to strike out the words, "who have not the means of a
                        comfortable support," and insert in lieu who have not taxable property to an
                        amount exceeding $3000"
                    Mr. BURTON supported the amendment. If the soldier sacrificed more than other
                        men, he had his compensation-he had more glory. He did not propose to tax
                        the people in this bill, for any case that did not require relief at our
                        hands. It was the State taking in hands to do what the several counties
                        could not do as well. But if the amendment was stricken out, the bill would
                        be to increase the soldiers' pay, and he would oppose it.
                    Mr. HIGGINS was in favor both of the bill and amendment. These four mills
                        assessments would raise a little more than two millions of dollars; but if
                        the amendment be stricken out, it would require five millions to satisfy the
                        demand that would flow from the provisions of the bill.
                    Mr. HUMPHREYS did not believe we could raise enough money to make these
                        appropriations, as contemplated in the original bill. He could not vote for
                        the bill without the amendment. There was an unreasonable mania about the
                        expenditure of public money. Nothing but taxation would cure this
                        insanity.
                    Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, spoke again ; against the amendment. In his county
                        they would return every family for this relief whose head has gone into the
                        army. He showed how the amendment would make strife. There would be no
                        justice in the administration of the bill with the amendment.
                    Mr. BECKETT. If the bill is to be made uniform, why not extend its benefits
                        to substitutes?
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. Why not include officers?
                    Mr. MILLER. We have never yet wanted for officers. The amendment requires the
                        soldier to live out; his substance before he Is relieved. Then the soldier,
                        by taxation, is required to help to afford this relief. This bill, without
                        the amendment, would work the most effectual encouragement to volunteering.
                        He could hardly vote for the bill with this inquisitorial amendment. It
                        changed the whole character of the bill. He had no fear of the taxation
                        involved. He could not defend the amendment ; but, without it, he could
                        defend the bill both before the soldiers and the people.
                    Mr. RICE. It was no relief to put our hands into the Treasury to pay out
                        money to soldiers' families that do not need it. Were not gentlemen seeking
                        a cheep popularity ? Were we not liable to the stigma of demagoguism? He was
                        for a reasonable bill for relief--to supply families in need. Further he
                        would not go. It was important to curtail the public expenditures, and that
                        was one form of relief.
                    Mr. SHUEY was in favor of the amendment. About half of these families do not
                        need relief-about half do. If we include all, at $8 per month for the wife,
                        and $2 to each child under 12 years of age, it were probable that we shall
                        not have half money enough.
                    The gentleman from Tippccanoe had said that the bill without the amendment,
                        would promote volunteering. He thought the amendment itself would encourage
                        volunteering, because the inducement was directed to the poor man.
                    Mr. PUETT would not vote for the bill, if he thought it would put money into
                        the pockets of anybody that can take care of himself. What right had the
                        Legislature to do such a thing? The bill with the amendment would hardly
                        supply the real cases of need. Call it charity if you will. Was it not our
                        business to take care of the poor?
                    Mr. NEWCOMB said objections to the amendment had been answered so well as to
                        leave him little to say. The bill required enumeration of these dependent
                        families, to be sent to the County Commissioners. There was inducement to
                        divert this fund. The guards against a partial administration were well
                        provided
                    Mr. BROWN moved to lay Mr. Chambers amendment on the table.
                    
                     And the yeas and nays being demanded and taken thereon, resulted-yeas 75,
                        nays 11. So it was laid on the table, and the question recurred on the
                        committee's amendment
                    .Mr. CHAMBERS moved to lay the committee's amendment on the table-Mr.
                        Chambers and Mr. Whiteside demanding the yeas and nays.
                    
                     The motion was rejected-yeas 28, nays 58. 
                    
                    So the House refused to lay the amendment on the table, and the question
                        again recurring  the committee's
                        amendment was adopted-yeas 62, nays 24. 
                    The last amendment of the committee, prescribing that payment shall be made
                        directly to the beneficiaries, &c., was voted down--
                    Mr. NEWCOMB having advised the House to leave a discretion here with the
                        disbursing officer. 
                    Mr. BRANHAM submitted a clerical amendment which was agreed to.
                    Mr. STRINGER proposed to amend by reducing the amount of assessment from
                        "four' to "three mills."
                    Mr. BUSKIRK submitted estimates to show that the assessment might be safely
                        reduced.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB said the gentleman's estimate of families would require over nine
                        millions of dollars.
                    Mr. BRANHAM had not submitted the bill without first having made careful
                        estimates.
                    Mr. STRINGER was pledged to vote for some such relief as this. He submitted a
                        statement of figures going to show that this tax would impose an intolerable
                        burden. He was ready to vote for a fair and reasonable amount of tax
                    Mr. GRIFFITH hoped the amendment would not prevail. He went into a statement
                        of figures to show that there would be a deficiency in the fund with the
                        assessment of "four mills."
                    Mr. WRIGHT said we were going to be taxed heavily. We should not embarrass
                        ourselves too much. He would vote for the reduction.
                    Mr. BURNES. The act of 1861, as an act for the relief of soldiers' families,
                        was good enough for him. He advised a careful husbanding of our resources.
                        He would vote against the bill, if the assessment could not be reduced.
                    Mr. ZEIGLER spoke in favor of the amendment, and indicated a still farther
                        reduction of the burden by reducing: the monthly allowance.
                    Mr. COLLINS would be in favor of two mills.
                    Mr. MEREDITH demanded the previous question and under its force the House
                        voted on Mr. Stringer's amendment.
                    Mr. WRIGHT demanded a division of the question.
                    
                    The first question being on striking out "4," and inserting "three"-it was
                        decided in the affirmative-yeas 52, nays 31.
                    
                    The other branch ot the amendment, striking out "one dollar," and inserting
                        "fifty cents," [poll tax] was rejected yeas 38, nays 45.
                    Mr. BECKETT proposed an amendment.
                    Mr. WOODS also desired to offer his amendment.
                    Mr. BROWN, under a question of order, contended that we were still under the
                        force of the previous question, and that it cuts off amendments as well as
                        debate.
                    Mr. BRANHAM moved that the bill be considered as engrossed, and passed the
                        third.

                    Mr. BECKETT gave notice of protest against the bill.
                    The bill was then read through the third time by the Clerk.
                    
                    It was passed the third reading in the House of Representatives; by yeas 63,
                        nays 18.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the gentleman from Monroe, (Mr. Buskirk,) and the
                        gentleman from Huntington (Mr. Coffroth,) be requested to vote on the
                        passage of this bill.
                    After debate, the motion was agreed to.
                    Mr. COFFROTH submitted that this requirement was equivalent to a change of
                        the rules, which denies a member without the bar at the time his name was
                        called, the right to vote, except by unanimous consent. There was but one
                        proposition before the House that he would go outside the bar to prevent its
                        passage that was the negro testimony bill.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK sbould not ask to vote till this question could be settled. He
                        had been called out, and went, with no intention to avoid the vote.
                    After further debate by Messrs. Newcomb, Laeselle and others--
                    On motion by Mr. BROWN, this question of order was laid on the table.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. COFFROTH and others without the bar at the time their names
                        were called, now asked and obtained permission to record their votes.


                    So the bill passed the House of Representatives.

                    The SPEAKER announced the appointment of Mr. Willis to the vacant place of
                        Mr. Staffer, (deceased,) in the Committee on
                        Railroads.
                    And then, at 5:35 P. M., the House adjourned till to-morrow morning 9
                        o'clock.
                


                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        THURSDAY, February 2, 1865.
                    

                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The journal of yesterday's proceedings was partially read when--
                    On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.

                    
                        WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication from the
                            Hon. Thomas Bowling, Resident Trustee of the Wabash and Erie Canal,
                            accompanied with the annual report of the Board of Trustees thereof.
                        Mr. MILLIGAN moved that it lie on the table, and that 500 copies be
                            printed for the use of the Senate.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    

                    
                         THE GOVERNORS MANSION.
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the regular order of business was dispensed
                            with, and the bill [S. 41,]
                            authorizing the sale of the Governor's residence, and appointing
                            commissioners to purchase an Executive mansion, and providing that the
                            Governor shall receive a sum not exceeding $5,000 a year until a
                            residence be furnished him, was taken up and read the second time.
                        Mr. COBB was not satisfied with this bill. The lot on Washington street,
                            which this bill proposes to sell, would be an eligible location for a
                            building for the occupancy of the public offices. With regard to an
                            Executive Mansion he liked the suggestions made when this subject was
                            last before this body by the Senator from Laporte [Mr. Niles] about the
                            building of a substantial residence. He suggested that the State owns a
                            little over four acres of ground near the Blind Asylum, (not University
                            Square,) which would be an eligible site for the Governor's residence. 
                        
                        Mr. THOMPSON spoke very highly of the Commissioners named in the bill,
                            and thought the State could purchase substantial buildings and handsome
                            grounds on batter terms than she could improve a lot and build
                            thereon.
                        Mr. OYLER reminded Senators that there is an old proverb which reads
                            something like this: Fools build houses but wise men buy them; from
                            which we might infer that it is much cheaper to purchase a third ready
                            made, than to go to work and make it. He thought it an excellent time to
                            sell this property; and for the same reason it is the wrong time to buy.
                            If he were correct in his opinion, it would be far better to postpone a
                            purchase till coming events cast their shadows before. If it should be
                            necessary to locate the State offices outside of the State House so much
                            needed, he knew of no place more appropriate than the lot belonging to
                            the State on Washington street. He insisted that it is not good policy
                            to sell that property now.
                         Mr. CORBIN concurred in the opinion expressed by the Senator from
                            Johnson [Mr. Oyler,] that now is a good time to sell, and the same
                            reasoning should bring us to a conclusion, that it is a bad time to buy.
                            He favored the selling of the lot of the Governor's residence; but if
                            there is any property owned by the State which she is likely to need, we
                            should keep it. It were likely that we will need the lots adjoining this
                            square on the south for State offices, and it would seem like folly to
                            sell them. It seemed unnecessary to rush this bill through in such
                            haste.
                        Mr. BENNETT was of opinion that a State Capitol would be the first thing
                            the State would build, and in it there would be ample room for all the
                            State offices. The State never would erect a separate building for State
                            offices. He hoped the bill would pass-and speedily.
                        Mr. DUNNING. This was an important bill, and it should pass at as early a
                            day as it can. He did not see why the Senate should refuse to pass it.
                            He had been told that this property would sell for not less than
                            $60,000, and perhaps $75,000. The interest on that might be appropriated
                            toward furnishing the Governor with a suitable mansion. It had been the
                            custom in Indiana to furnish a residence for the Governor, and we owe
                            this much to Governor Morton. Now, if it be our duty, and has been our
                            custom, to furnish our Governor with a mansion, as long as we keep him
                            out of it we are doing him injustice, and we ought to foot the bills
                            incurred on that account. And these bills are considerable. He bad not
                            talked with the Governor on the subject, but had heard it said that the
                            Governor's bills amounted to something like $150 a week. And if you
                            multiply that by 52, the number of weeks in a year, you will begin to
                            see in dollars and cents what we have to expend on his account, or treat
                            our Executive unfairly.
                        Mr. BEESON. The bill contained but one provision bearing imperatively on
                            the commissioners, and that was the sale of the property. Other matters
                            are discretionary.
                        Mr. COBB insisted that we ought to sell this property now, but not
                            purchase at this time. Even if the property were sold for $50,000, the
                            interest on the proceeds would rent the best house in the city. He would
                            be satisfied with the bill if that part of it were stricken out which
                            relates to re-investing the proceeds of the sale, and that part which
                            authorizes the sale cf the lots on Washington street.
                        Mr. DUNNING was informed that the property on Washington street could be
                            sold for $28,000; and he thought it would be a money-making operation to
                            sell all the property the State could spare, and with the proceeds
                            thereof pay the principal on our debts, and stop interest.
                        Mr. MILLIGAN moved to amend by authorizing the Commissioners to loan the
                            money arising from the sale of this property out on interest, if, in
                            their judgment, they do not think best to build or purchase a residence
                            for the Governor at this time, and the amount applied to paying the rent
                            of the Governor's house.
                        Mr. DOWNEY. The original bill made [no provision for a residence for the
                            Governor until a house should be built; and it was upon his suggestion
                            that the amendment was incorporated, paying to the Governor a sum not to
                            exceed $5,000 till a residence should be prepared. The committee were
                            unanimous in recommending the bill in its present form. He thought
                            Senators who opposed this bill . Here influenced by a spirit or
                            speculation. He should opposed all amendments offered, unless they
                            commended themselves to his judgement more than the amendment now before
                            the Senate.
                        Mr. NILES desired to see what property we do not want sold as soon as
                            judicious and honest men shall think it advisable. Then he would have a
                            comfortable residence rented for the Governor, and the rent paid out of
                            the proceeds of the sale, and the balance preserved as a separate fund
                            for the purpose of securing a perfect residence for the Governor of the
                            State at some future time.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. Information as to rents in the city was, that a suitable
                            residence was from $4,500 to 5,000. Senators have no idea of our
                            rents-in some parts of the city they are fabulous. The Governor was
                            naturally anxious for a home. It was supposable that, if the Stats would
                            give him a suitable amount of money, he would provide himself with a
                            comfortable residence.
                        Mr. OYLER said we owed it to ourselves to furnish the Governor with a
                            house suitable to the dignity of his office; and till we do so, it was
                            but a matter of justice that we vote him a sum sufficient to provide
                            himself with a residence. He opposed the pending amendment and moved to
                            recommit the bill to the same committee.
                        Mr. MILLIGAN withdrew his amendment
                        Mr. BENNETT moved to recommit the bill to the same committee, with
                            instructions to amend, by striking out that portion of the bill
                            authorizing the purchase of, or the building of a house for the
                            Governor.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to strike out of the bill all that relates to the
                            selling of property.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the amendment was laid on the table--yeas 25,
                            nays 21-as follows:

                        Mr. NILES moved to amend by inserting in the proper place the following:
                            "The proceeds of said property not required for other purposes
                            contemplated in this act shall be invested in bonds of this State, which
                            with the accruing interest shall remain as a fund-- first, to pay the
                            rent of a house for the Governor, when necessary, and the residue for
                            the purpose of procuring grounds and building a permanent residence for
                            the Governor."
                         The amendment was rejected.
                        On motion by Mr. TERRY, the bill was then ordered to be engrossed.
                    

                    
                        ADJOURNMENT.
                        On motion by Mr. NILES, it was 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns
                                        to-night, it adjourn till 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.
                                
                            
                        
                    



                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        were concurred in recommending that Senate bill 89, [see page 109 of
                            these Reports,] and Senate bill 105, introduced day before yesterday, be
                            laid on the table.
                    

                    
                         ROAD TAX.
                        Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following:
                        
                            MR. PRESIDENT-The Judiciary
                                Committee to which was referred Senate Bill No. 58, have
                            had the same under consideration, and are of opinion that the provision
                            in the section as it originally stood, and as it is proposed to re-enact
                            it, authorizing a tax not to exceed one and one-fourth cents on each
                            acre of taxable lands, is repugnant to section 1, article 10, of the
                            Constitution, because the tax is authorized to be laid on each acre of
                            land, without regard to its value. But while the Committee think that
                            this clause of the law should be omitted in the section as amended, they
                            also think that the maximum ad valorum amounts which may be levied as a
                            road tax should be increased from fifteen cents to twenty cents on the one hundred dollars. This will
                            enable counties in which there may be lands of non-residents, to compel
                            the owners to bear their equal part of the expenses of making and
                            improving the roads which may be made in the neighborhood of their
                            lands, and by which their value may be increased.
                        The Committee, therefore, recommend that the following amendments be made
                            to the bill, to wit: at line 39 strike out the words "and may assess a
                            tax not excluding one and one-fourth cents on each acre of taxable
                            land." In line 35, strike out the word "fifteen" and insert the word
                            "twenty." With these amendments the Committee recommend that the bill
                            pass.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to amend the report by striking out "20," and inserting
                            "25" cents tax for road purposes. He said, in the levying of a special
                            school tax for the purpose of building school houses, one township
                            levied a tax of 25 cents, another but 5 cents, and another 10 cents.
                            Now, where is the equality or uniformity of a taxation in a county in
                            that case? Again, one county levies a tax of 40 cents for county
                            purposes, and another of 60 cents; and there is the uniformity of
                            taxation there? These taxes are objected to because they are unequal. We
                            put a tax of 1 1/4 cents upon an acre of land worth only $1,25, and we
                            pat the same tax on an sere which is worth ten times as much. Grant it;
                            but it is on the same principle with the other. He cited cases of
                            hardship in one of the counties represented by him, and thought the
                            whole thing: was an error; contending that the old law is just as
                            correct as any other principle of taxation we have in the State.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        The report of the Committee, as amended, was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        PER DIEM OF LEGISLATORS.
                        The Committee on Finance returned the bill S. 20, (see page 38 of these
                            Reports,) recommending "that it lie on the table, as it is their opinion
                            that any change increasing the per diem of members and officers of the
                            General Assembly, owing to the present financial condition of our State,
                            is at this time inexpedient.
                        Mr. BENNETT. I hope that the report of the committee will not be
                            concurred in. I am in favor of increasing the pay of Senators and
                            Representatives to the amount provided in the bill under consideration.
                            I need not say that the present pay of members of the Legislature is
                            insufficient to pay their expenses, tor I presume no Senator will
                            pretend to dispute that proposition. While I am opposed to paying
                            exorbitant salaries, I am for doing justice. I shall not contend that
                            members of the Legislature should receive such pay as would enrich them;
                            but I do contend that their reasonable expenses should be paid; and I
                            know that five dollars per day is not unreasonable, and that the people
                            of the State will not think that amount too much. Beside, sir, unless a
                            sum sufficient to pay expenses is allowed, the effect will be to prevent
                            a poor man from aspiring to the position. I know, sir, that in Great
                            Britain the members of Parliament get no pay; but that arrangement was
                            adopted by the aristocracy for the very purpose of driving out men of
                            small means. When the present per diem was adopted, three dollars was
                            worth more than ten now. At that time, members could board for less per
                            week than we can now per day. We now pay our clerks, and other employes,
                            five dollars per day. If members fear that their constituents will
                            condemn them for such a vote, they are greatly mistaken. I believe my
                            constituents think my services of sufficient importance them, to be
                            willing to pay my reasonable expenses while in attendance on the
                            session, and think that I have sacrificed enough when I lose my time,
                            without paying money out of my own pocket. If, I supposed, for one
                            moment, that my people were so penurious and mean, as to begrudge to
                            their Senators and Representatives their necessary expenses, I would
                            resign to-day, for I am not a fit Representative of such a people. And
                            if I thought my services were not considered by my constituents of
                            sufficient value to demand of them a payment of my expenses, I would
                            surely give them a speedy opportunity to supply my place with a better
                            man. I am ready to put myself on the record, at any time, for any
                            measure that my judgment approves of, and I know my constituents will
                            not condemn me.
                        Mr. CARSON. The Committee were of opinion that $5 per day would not be
                            too much pay  for a member or
                            officers, but were prompted to make this report from the fact that we
                            are already heavily burdened with taxation and expect to be more so. We
                            are legislating for an Assembly and officers that will assume their
                            positions two years hence, and we cannot foresee the state of the
                            country two years from now. We are in the midst of a fierce strife, and
                            we feel that we have to submit in common with other citizens of the
                            State to the burdens of the hour. Two years hence we cannot foresee
                            whether the country will be in the same condition. Such a financial
                            crash may come upon the country as that $3 a day may be an ample
                            compensation. It was sufficient to pay his expenses. He had received
                            letters from his county and township officers asking for an increase of
                            salary, and could not very well go home and be opposed to raising their
                            pay, whilst on the record in favor of raising his own.
                        Mr. WRIGHT said this was his last term here, and such is the make of his
                            district-(they take in turn by counties)-that he had no hope of coming
                            back very soon. Yet he thought no man could afford to come here for $3 a
                            day, and consequently he opposed the report ot the Committee, and hoped
                            it would not be adopted.
                        Mr. OYLER stood in opposition to the report.
                        Mr. CORBIN acted on the principle, that it is our duty in times like
                            these to guard well the treasury. He was opposed to increasing salaries,
                            unless it could be done equally and to all. He was in favor of
                            concurrence in the report of the committee.
                        Mr. CASON. The question was, how we can best insure ability in coming
                            Legislatures? Men of character and ordinary sagacity in these times were
                            making money, and we should fix a high rate of compensation for those
                            who come here to legislate upon the affairs of the country important as
                            they are likely to be.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, would vote against the report of the committee. He
                            always thought the pay of members entirely too small-particularly at
                            this time.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK favored conconcurrence. He deemed it due to his
                            constituents to vote for an increase of pay.
                        The report was not concurred in--yeas 19, nays 27--as follows:

                        On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the bill was then ordered to be
                            engrossed.
                    
                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Recommending the passage of Senate bills numbered. 53 and 92 (see pages 60 and 109) and the
                            bill S. 114 (introduced day before yesterday,) were severally concurred
                            in.
                    
                    
                        LEGISLATIVE EXPENSES.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the bill [S.
                                1] providing for the payment of the expenses of the present
                            session of the General Assembly reported from the House of
                            Representatives this afternoon, was made the special order for Thursday
                            next at 2 1/2 o'clock, P. M.
                        And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.
                    
                


                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        THURSDAY, February 2, 1865.
                    

                    The SPEAKER took the chair at 9 o'clock A. M. and directed the roll-call to
                        determine a quorum.
                    A quorum being reported present, and answering to their names--
                    On motion by Mr. BOYD, the reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed
                        with.
                    On the motion of Mr. MEREDITH, (by unanimous consent) the report of the
                        Trustees of the Wabash and Erie Canal was taken up, and 500 copies thereof
                        were ordered to be printed.
                    Mr. GRIFFITH asked leave of absence for the Committee on the
                            Northern Prison for visiting that institution after Tuesday
                        noon.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB objected.
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        Mr. MEREDITH presented the remonstrance of sundry citizens of Sullivan
                            county against a recent appropriation of $75,000 by the Board of
                            Commissioners of said county to aid and assist drafted men-and
                            protesting against legalizing such acts; which was read and referred to
                            the Committee on the Judiciary.
                    


                    
                         UNSKILLFUL PRACTICE IN MEDICINE.
                        Mr. COFFROTH presented the petition of sundry citizens of Huntington
                            county, asking for the enactment of a law for protection against the
                            evils growing out of the practice of medicine by unskillful persons,
                            which was read.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved that it be referred to a select committee of fire,
                            asking that Mr. Griffith be made the Chairman thereof.
                        Mr. BURNES moved that it be referred to the Committee on Rights
                                and Privileges.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH and Mr. COFFROTH considered that the petition ought to go
                            into the hands of its friends-should be committed also to members of the
                            medical profession.
                        
                        Mr. BURNES'S motion was rejected--affirmative 24, negative 49.
                        It was then referred to the Select Committee.
                        Mr. COFFROTH presented a paper from Dr. Abel M. Lewis, of Huntington
                            county, remonstrating against legislation on this subject; which was
                            read, and he then moved that it be referred to the same committee.
                        Mr. BURNES moved that it be referred to the Committee on Rights
                                and Privileges.The latter motion, having preference and
                            being first taken, was rejected.
                        It was then referred to the Select Committee.
                        Mr. GREGORY presented a paper signed by J. C. Stone, against legislation
                            on the subject and asked that it have the same reference.
                        It was ruled out of order.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB presented two claims papers from citizens of Marion county,
                            which, without reading, was referred to the Committee on
                                Claims.
                    
                    
                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            reported back the bill [S. 25] to amend the misdemeanor act of June 14,
                            1852, without amendment, recommending its passage.
                        It lies on the table.
                    
                    
                        COURT RECORDS
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Judiciary Committee, returned
                            Mr. Coffroth's bill [H. R. 61] requiring Court Clerks to index their
                            records, reporting the opinion that legislation was unnecessary thereon,
                            inasmuch as Clerks are now required to index their records.
                         It was ordered to lie on the table.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider the order just taken. In his county no
                            indexes have been made. The bill was to remedy the difficulty of turning
                            over the records leaf by leaf to find a particular record. There was the
                            same difficulty in many other counties. He understood that the committee
                            had acted upon the opinion that the law required clerks to make indexes.
                            This was an error.
                        The order was then reconsidered.
                        On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, the bill was then recommitted to the same
                            committee, with instructions to inquire further.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned the bill [S. 14] to
                            amend the act in relation to County Treasurers, of June 14, 1852,
                            recommending its passage, with an amendment, inserting these words: "And
                            all other officers and their sureties whose bonds are approved by the
                            County Commissioners."
                        Mr. WHITESIDE, from the same committee, returned Mr. Lasselle's assault
                            bill, No. 65, reporting-No legislation necessary, in view of the
                            decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Wall vs. The State.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the same committee, returned Mr. Miller of Clinton's
                            bill, No. 67, authorizing attorneys to hold liens on judgments,
                            reporting the opinion that it ought to pass;
                        Also, Mr. Miller of Clinton's bill, No. 64, to amend the 406th section of
                            the general practice act, recommending its passage;
                        Which reports, under the rules, were ordered to lie on the table.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Banks, returned
                            the report of the Bank of the State and the several branches thereof,
                            and reported a motion that they be laid on the table, and 300 copies
                            thereof be printed.
                        It was so ordered.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, returned Mr. Meredith's high school bill, No. 82,
                            recommending its passage.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, returned his bill, No. 38, and Mr. Cook's bill,
                            No. 54, for an amendment of the school law of 1861, so as to admit of
                            the loaning of the school fund in sums not exceeding $1,000-recommending
                            the passage of No. 38 and that No. 54 be laid on the table.
                        These reports severally lie on the table.
                    
                    
                        NELSON FERRIS.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Claims, reported
                            the claim of Nelson Ferris for 5323 38, for expenses incurred by him in
                            returning fugitives from justice, recommending its allowance and
                            insertion in the specific appropriation bill. He moved that it be
                            referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. BRANHAM supposed the proper course to be for the report to be first
                            acted on by the House. He proposed to so amend the motion as to instruct
                            the Committee on Ways and Means to incorporate the
                            claim in the specific appropriation bill.
                        The amended motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered.
                        Mr. LOCKHART, from the Committee on Railroads,
                            returned Mr. Grove's Railroad Bill No. 89, recommending its passage.
                        He also returned from the same committee, Mr. Groves's Railroad bill, No.
                            75, recommending its passage.
                        Mr. STRINGER, from the Committee on Roads, returned
                            Mr. Emerson's road bill No. 15, without amendment, and recommending us
                            passage.
                        These reports and bills lie on the table under the rule.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, (by unanimous consent) from the Committee on the
                                Judiciary, returned Mr. Beckett's bill [H. R. 45]
                            legalizing the acts of civil officers in the military service, without
                            amendment, recommending its passage.
                        It lies on the table. 
                    
                    
                         BILLS INTRODUCED AND REFERRED.
                        Mr. JOHNSON introduced a bill [H. R. 110] for an act to amend the 5th

                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Claims. 
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, introduced a bill [H. R. 113] for an act to amend
                            section 150 of the Common School act, of March 5, 1855, (German
                            teachers.)Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Education.
                        Mr. KILGORE introduced a bill [H. R. 114] for an act to amend section 1
                            of the act relative to the salaries of [all] public officers, approved
                            March 5, 1859.Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to
                            the Committee on Fees and Salaries.

                            to the second reading.
                        Mr. HOGATE moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                                Agriculture.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK preferred that all the bills for this object go to the same
                            committeethe Committee on Education. He had no choice between these
                            committees, only that two committees be  not charged with the consideration of the
                            same subject.
                        Mr. KILGORE preferred the Agricultural Committee.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN. Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, and Mr. RHOADS, concurred with Mr.
                            Buskirk.
                        Mr. HOGATE. This bill was unlike any of the rest on this subject. It
                            provides merely for acceptance of the grant, and disposition of the land
                            script.
                        It was referred to the Committee on Education.
                        Mr. PUETT made an ineffectual motion to suspend the order cf business,
                            and called up the Putnam Court bill from the Senate, No. 42.
                        Mr. WRIGHT made an ineffectual motion for a dispensation to enable him to
                            call up his Oil Mining bill No. 63.
                        Mr. RHOADS made an ineffectual motion for a dispensation to enable him to
                            call up his bill [H. R. No. 84] to legalize commissioners' action in
                            Vermillion county.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK insisted on the regular order of business--the first thing in
                            unfinished business being the consideration of the bill from the Senate
                            No. 1, providing for the expenses of the General Assembly.
                        The SPEAKER said the matter indicated was not yet in the regular
                            order.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK then made an ineffectual motion to suspend the regular
                            order.

                        The bill [S. 55] fixing courts

                        Mr. KILGORE moved ineffectually to suspend the regular order and take up
                            the bill from the Senate, No.

                        Mr. MILROY made an ineffectual motion for adjournment.

                            was passed to the first reading.
                        
                        Mr. PUETT (moving a suspension of the constitutional restriction, which
                            was agreed to, yeas 82, nays 1) now moved that the farther readings be

                            passage.

                        Mr. WOODS made an ineffectual motion to refer it to the
                                Committee on Education.
                        On motion of Mr. GOODMAN it was referred to the Special

                            reading.
                        Mr. WOODS moved ineffectually to refer it to the Committee on

                            Representatives, for the nine last days of that session of the General
                            Assembly.
                        Mr. BURTON proposed to amend the amendment by adding the following:


                        And be it further enacted, That the sum of two thousand
                            dollars be appropriated to defray the expenses incurred by the patriotic
                            (?) members (who bolted from the last "General Assembly") in the
                            purchase of arms and ammunition to fortify themselves in the city of
                            Madison, (on the southern coast of the State) against the combined
                            attack of the "Sargeant-at-Arms," who might have been, but was not, sent
                            to bring them back, and against the possibility of the "Knights of the
                            Golden Circle," attempting to revolutionize the State of Indiana and
                            slide her out of the Union into the arms of the "Southern
                            Confederacy."
                        And be it further enacted, That the arms, ammunition
                            and implements of war, which were at the disposal of the seceders while
                            fortified in the city of Madison, be and the same are hereby ordered to
                            be placed forthwith (by the persons having the same in custody) in the
                            State Arsenal, to be set apart therein and kept exclusively for the use
                            and benefit of such members of the General Assembly as may (in any
                            future emergency of a like character) see proper to imitate the
                            patriotic (?) example of their "illustrious predecessors."
                        
                        WHEREAS, An emergency exists for the immediate taking
                            effect of this act, because of the inability of the bolters to pay their
                            hotel and saloon bills, &c., contracted in the city of Madison,
                            while so fortifying as aforesaid, and for the further reason that said
                            arms and ammunition are liable to be squandered and thus lost forever
                            tot he State; therefore the same shall be in full force and effect from
                            and after its passage and publication in the Madison papers.

                         The SPEAKER ruled the amendment out of order.

                        Mr. BROWN made the point of order that the amendment was not germane to
                            the bill. He fortified his point by reading the governing constitutional
                            provision, section 19: ''Every act shall embrace but one subject, and
                            matters properly connected therewith."
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It was an appropriation bill: and the House had already
                            amended it by adding matter foreign to the expense of the present
                            session. He cited precedents, sustaining the practice. The fact of an
                            amendment not mentioned in the title made no difference, conform after
                            the passage of the bill. 
                        Mr. HIGGINS took the same view.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe replied to the constitutional objection. The
                            subject of the bill was not the Legislature, but an appropriation. The
                            "subject" must be in the title "matters properly connected therewith"
                            come into the bill without restriction.
                        Mr. LASSELLE showed the object of this constitutional restriction. It was
                            to prevent log-rolling, to make every proposition stand on its own
                            merits. He contended that the amendment pertained to a subject entirely
                            different from that of the original bill. It made a question of
                            conscience. Answering a question by Mr. Griffith, Mr. L. stated that he
                            would vote for the repayment of the money in the amendment, so far as
                            the expenses of the Asylums are concerned.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, replying to Messrs. Higgins and Miller, said the amendment
                            would be proper in a general appropration bill.
                        Mr. BROWN had raised the question of order in good faith. He maintained,
                            aside from the constitutional provision, that the amendment was not in
                            order. But he proceeded to answer Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe. The subject
                            of the bill was not an appropriation in the general. It was a most
                            specific appropriation. This amendment was a bill to pay expenses of the
                            State, or it was an appropriation to pay what it recites as a public
                            debt, due and bearing interest.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. Then the question is, simply, for us to decide whether the
                            State shall pay her debts. He did not appreciate the difference between
                            specific and general appropriations in the matter of paving a public
                            debt.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH looked upon this as a necessary proposition. This money has
                            been borrowed-
                        Mr. BUSKIRK urged the point that the merits of the amendment could not be
                            discussed in a question of order.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said there was the same variety in the items of specific and
                            general bills of appropriation-the subject was appropriations. That
                            being the subject matter, it was competent to put in the bill other
                            appreciations. It was to pay the debts of the State. The two
                            propositions were equivalent-similar: they were both to pay debts He
                            hoped the amendment would be adopted, and the bill passed at once.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair begged to be indulged on the question of order. It
                            had not been free from difficulty in his own mind, and it had not been
                            without reflection that he had arrived at his conclusion when be
                            determined to entertain the amendment of the gentleman from
                            Jefferson.
                        It is claimed that the decision of the Chair contravenes the
                            constitutional provision, and secondly, that it contravenes the rules of
                            the House.
                        
                        The constitutional provision was to the effect, that every bill shall
                            contain but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title. It
                            was hardly necessary to mention to gentlemen experienced In
                            parliamentary laws, that whatever title is written on a bill, it is
                            regarded merely as a journal act, till we determine the title. It could
                            not be, that the framers of the Constitution intended to subvert the
                            ordinary usages far facilitating legislation. For years of past
                            legislation this method of making appropriations had been uniform
                            whether in general or specific bills. He adverted to the fact, that in
                            the practice of Congress, what, might be germane to a naval or a post
                            office appropriation bill, could not be placed in an Indian
                            appropriation bill, &c. But if he was correct, that the title forms
                            no part of the bill, being simply a clerical act, then the objection
                            drawn from our rules could not exclude the amendment, either to a
                            specific or a general bill. The judgment of the Chair was, that this
                            should be regarded as a general appropriation bill, and that items,
                            other than for the expenses of the General Assembly may be embraced in
                            it.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-affirmative 24, negative
                            not counted.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK offered the following amendment to the amendment:
                        
                            Strike out amendment, and insert: That the sum of
                                $135,000 be appropriated to pay the expenses of the Benevolent
                                Institutions for the years 1863 and 1864.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM and Mr. GRIFFITH. This money was not due to those
                            institution; it was due to creditors of the Governor.
                         Mr. BROWN. Did the Governor borrow it?
                         Mr. GRIFFITH. His own county had loaned it to the Governor.
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon, the result
                            was--yeas 31, nays 53--as follows:

                        So the amendment was rejected.

                         Mr. BROWN proposed farther to amend, by striking out all that relates to
                            interest on the loan.
                        
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon, it was
                            rejected--yeas 29, nays 53; and the question recurred on Mr. Branham's
                            amendment.
                        Mr. BRANHAM in reply to Mr. Coffroth, stated that the items of debt
                            mentioned in the amendment had all been passed upon by the Joint Special
                            Committee on the Expenses of the Executive Department.
                        The yeas and nays being taken on the amendment, resulted--yeas 55, nays

                        So Mr. Branham's amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH asked unanimous consent to offer on amendment to the effect

                        FRIDAY, February 3,1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock.
                    The Secretary's journal of yesterday's proceedings was being read, when-
                    On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following report: 
                    
                    
                    Mr PRESIDENT-The Judiciary Committee to which was referred
                        Senate bill No. 45, amending section 37 of the Statute in regard to
                        misdemeanors, have had the same under consideration, and find that the bill
                        proposes to amend a section which they think was impliedly repealed by the
                        act approved March 3,1859. While the bill is in this form, the Committee has
                        not thought it necessery to decide upon the propriety or necessity of the
                        proposed enactment. They, therefore, recommend that the same be laid upon
                        the table.
                    The report was concurred in.

                            property belonging to widows and orphans, have had the same under
                            consideration, and direct me to report the same back to the Senate, with
                            a recommendation that it be referred to the Committee on
                                Judiciary.
                        The report was concurred in.

                            present for the passage of the resolution, Congress having passed the
                            "amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery in the United States,"

                            Senator Richmond, instructing the committee to inquire into the
                            propriety of authorizing the location of public highways in certain
                            localities;

                            resolution, and that it is the unanimous opinion of your committee that
                            legislation upon the subject is inexpedient, and they recommend that the
                            resolution lie on the table, and that the committee be discharged from
                            the further consideration of the same.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    

                    
                         DRAINING THE CALUMET VALLEY.
                        The Judiciary Committee, to whom was referred Senate
                            bill No. 107, entitled, An act to authorise certain persons therein
                            named to dig and construct a certain canal, returned the same with a
                            recommendation that the title and the second section thereof be stricken
                            out, and the following inserted in lieu thereof; and with such amendment
                            they recommend its passage. The amendment in lieu of the 2d section of
                            the original bill strikes out the names of certain gentlemen named, and
                            leaves the act general in its character. The committee recommend that
                            the title of the bill [S. 107] shall be, "An act giving the consent of
                            the State of Indiana to the drainage of the valley of the Calumet
                            river."
                        Mr. NILES said that the Judiciary Committee had made
                            radical changes in the bill, the chief object of which was to prevent
                            the possibility of the matter being made a monopoly, or the subject of
                            unjust speculation. He remarked that the Calumet river flows west
                            through the northern part of this State, nearly parallel to the southern
                            end of Lake Michigan. After entering the State of Illinois it returns
                            upon itself and empties into the Lake. The stream is bordered by wide
                            marsh and bottom lands. The Michigan and Illinois Canal Company, in
                            order to provide an additional feeder for their canal, cave built a dam
                            across the river near the line10of this State, and have flooded many
                            thousand acres of land in Lake county. The people of that county feel
                            themselves aggrieved by the act. Lake Michigan is below the level of the
                            water in the Calumet, and is only a short distance from it. Engineers
                            are of the opinion that by digging a channel from the river to the lake,
                            the surplus water can be drained off from the valley of the Calumet, and
                            the lands reclaimed. The bill, as modified by the committee, simply
                            gives the consent of the State to the drainage of the river by any
                            company which may be organized under the general law, in regard to the
                            drainage of swamp lands. This may seem like a summary and harsh remedy
                            tor the wrong done by the canal company to the people of this State.
                            But, if the action contemplated should prove unjustifiable, the canal
                            company can have a complete remedy in the Federal Courts. Were it proper
                            for him to take cognizance of the affairs of our neighbors, he would say
                            that it would be a good thing if the action under this bill should
                            compel the people of Chicago and Illinois to deepen their canal, so as
                            to feed it from Lake Michigan. They are abundantly able to do it without
                            begging aid from the General Government. While giving them an invaluable
                            channel for commerce, it would remove the nuisance of the Chicago river,
                            and make the city of Chicago a wholesome place. The Committee had
                            perfected the bill to the best of their ability, but he was desirous
                            that we should be guilty of no discourtesy toward a neighboring State,
                            and in order to insure full consideration, he moved that the bill, with
                            the amendments, be referred to the Committee on Canals and
                                Internal Improvements. 
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    


                    
                         UNIFORMITY OF ASSESSMENTS.
                        
                        
                        Mr. CULLEN submitted the following report:
                         MR. PRESIDENT-The Committee on County and
                                Township Business, to whom was referred the resolution
                            concerning uniformity in the assessment of articles of personal
                            property, have had the same under consideration, and direct me to report
                            the same back to the Senate, and recommend that is, lie on the table, as
                            in their judgment no further legislation upon the subject is
                            necessary.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    



                    
                         REBEL RAIDS.
                        
                        Mr. VAWTER, from the special committee thereon, returned his bill  [S. 15]  appointing commissioners
                            to adjust claims for damages sustained by reason of raids of rebel
                            forces, with numerous amendments, and when the bill is so amended they
                            recommend its passage.
                        The report was concurred in.


                        Mr. BENNETT moved to amend as follows:
                        Strike out the word "General" wherever the same occurs before the name of
                            John Morgan and insert the words "the guerilla chief;" and, wherever the
                            word "Colonel" occurs before the name of Adam Johnson, and insert the
                            words "the guerilla."
                        Mr. BENNETT had some military pride about the matter. He regarded the
                            persons referred to as simply leaders of a band of cut-throats and
                            robbers. He did not want to acknowledge them as bearing any military
                            title-he did not want to come that near recognizing the Southern
                            Confederacy.
                        
                         Mr. VAWTER explained that in drawing up the bill in this respect, he
                            copied the language of His Excellency, the Governor, whose loyalty will
                            not be doubted by the Senator from Union, [Mr. Bennett.]
                        Mr. COBB understood that Morgan and Johnson were recognized by our
                            Government as possessing the titles given them in this bill; and while
                            making no opposition to the amendment proposed, he thought the language
                            of the bill respectful to the persons referred to and to ourselves.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, stood opposed to the amendment. Should it appear on
                            our statute books it will lay this Legislature liable to the aspersion
                            that it was put there through bad blood. This John Morgan and this Adam
                            Johnson have been recognized by the press and the officials of our
                            country by their titles, and surely this Legislature is not surrendering
                            any of its dignity by so recognizing them. If the Senate is fastidious
                            about this matter let these persons be referred to by their names,
                            "so-called General, and so-called Colonel."
                        Mr. BENNETT asked if his amendment did not state a fact, and if so, why
                            not adopt it ?
                        Mr. BROWN understood that John Morgan held a commission as General from
                            the so-called Confederate government. No matter what position any one
                            occupies in society, the true gentleman will always recognize that
                            person, if he has to have any intercourse with him, by the title of "
                            Mr." Respect for our own dignity as a Legislative body should suggest
                            that we title them as they are in the bill before the Senate.
                        Mr. OYLER deemed it his duty to oppose this amendment for reasons already
                            stated and from his own convictions of propriety and right. It is too
                            late in the day to undertake to sacrifice our own dignity for the
                            purpose of venting a little spite against anybody-not desiring to charge
                            the Senator from Union [Mr. Bennett] with such feelings. Like others who
                            had acquired titles in a land where titles are not allowed, he, too,
                            probably felt a little jealous about an indiscriminate use of them; but
                            then it is necessary in this bill. The names of these men appear here
                            merely as a matter of description, and when we speak of them we ought to
                            give them their titles.
                        Mr. BENNETT (interposing.) If the gentleman were going to say something
                            in this bill about President Jeff. Davis, could he do so without
                            explaining that he was President of the so-called Confederate
                            States?
                        Mr. OYLER. No, sir.
                        Mr. BENNETT. Just as well to leave out the title in the one case as in
                            the other.
                        Mr. OYLER had no objection to saying, after Morgan's name, the so-called
                            General of the Confederate States. He insisted that we use respectful
                            titles--especially when men are dead.I, for one, war not with the
                            dead.
                        Mr. RICHMOND opposed the amendment offered by the Senator from Union. We
                            have been compelled to acknowledge the rank of these men, and
                            acknowledge their armies as military organizations on many a hard-fought
                            field. The Senator from Union (Mr. Bennett,) and the Senator from
                            Johnson (Mr. Oyler,) have, time and again, vaunted before this Sen-ute
                            the fact that they have been in the service of the United States, and
                            that they have occupied the honorable position of Colonel of Volunteers.
                            I have sat very quietly, and hare never urged my claims; but I think the
                            time has now come when I should announce to the Senate, that I too have
                            occupied the honorable position of Colonel of Volunteers. [Applause.] I,
                            sir, with there honorable gentlemen, fought, bled and died for my
                            country. [Laughter.]
                        Mr. CORBIN thought it undignified to indulge in billingsgate slang, and
                            get ourselves down to the use of vulgar phrases and epithets, He was
                            opposed to the amendment, because be saw no good to come from it. If we
                            are to deal with our neighbors kindly, as I believe we are commanded to
                            do, we certainly should not use such language. If we are to convert
                            them, we must not heap coals of fire upon our enemies' heads. We are
                            told that a soft answer turneth away wrath. Seriously, he could see no
                            particular advantage in this play upon titles. He could not see that the
                            so-called Confederacy is such a tender plant, that is going to wither,
                            if we refuse to give their leaders titles which are common to our own
                            officers,
                        Mr. BENNETT. If gentlemen were so nice and particular about titles, it
                            was understood that Morgan was a Major General, and they ought to call
                            him so. He would style him a cut-throat, scoundrel-traitor.
                        Mr. THOMPSON had not cared about titles here, till the issue was made;
                            but now he felt interested. John Morgan did not come to his position as
                            General Lee did. The former began by stealing horses from Union men.
                            Then be led a guerrilla band, and it was not till some time that he was
                            recognized as a general, and before he died that title was taken from
                            him. He was nothing but a guerrilla chieftain. If it were necessary to
                            sustain the dignity of Indiana to call a man a general, who made his
                            reputation by stealing horses, he thought the price of the State dignity
                            was very small indeed. He hoped John Morgan would be called simply a
                            guerrilla chief; and he met with a proper fate when a bullet took him
                            from God's beautiful earth. He hoped no Democrat, Republican or Union
                            man would be guilty of staining the pages of history by calling him
                            general, He had no soft words for rebels-would deal out death and
                            destruction to them if he could.
                        Mr. CULLEN moved to amend, by striking out the words ''general" and
                            ''colonel" where ever they occur in the amendment.
                        Mr. BENNETT accepted.
                        The amendment was then agreed to.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN offered an amendment striking out from the bill all that
                            relates to the appropriation of money from the Treasury. As it is, the
                            bill would open the door an amount beyond all calculation. True the bill
                            says there shall not be paid out more than $300,000. But, if it were
                            just to pay that, it would be just to pay for all that has been
                            destroyed. The appropriation was recommended by the Governor for the
                            purpose of relieving parties who are suffering for want of this money.
                            Suppose we limit the amount, who are the parties that will get pay? Not
                            the needy map, the sharper--a certain class already holding a large
                            amount of these claims. He was opposed to the State's paying; for we have an
                            amount of money to pay nearly beyond all calculation--over six, nearly
                            seven millions of dollars. And the bill, called the Soldiers' Relief
                            Bill, will take a million and a half more--amounting in all to something
                            near $8,000,000. He was in favor of repaying every dollar's worth
                            destroyed; and understood, if we pass upon these claims and find them to
                            be correct, and file them with he general Government, they will at some
                            time be paid.
                         Mr. ALLISON was a friend of the bill, but if the amendment were adopted
                            he would vote against the whole thing. He was opposed to putting the
                            State to the expense of appointing a commission to adjust the claims of
                            his constituency who are folly capable of sending their claims to
                            Washington, without the interference of a commission. He came here to
                            benefit by voice and vote the interests of the State at large. The duty
                            of the Government is to protect the interest--life, limb and property of
                            its citizens, and it would not do to adopt a policy by which one part of
                            the State shall take care of itself. His county furnished the first
                            organized company of volunteers which responded to the President's call
                            for 75,000 men; and had continued to do her duty nobly ever since. And
                            now we ask our brethren in other parts of the State to come to our help
                            in the present distress. If the State will pay these claims, they will
                            soon be returned to her by the General Government. It was a matter of
                            regret that any Senator should be found here ready to oppose so just or
                            so equitable a bill as that new under consideration. It can work no
                            wrong to any portion of the State; and he appealed to Senators to be
                            magnanimous and come forward and vote for this measure.
                        Mr. COBB believed the General Government would pay these claims at some
                            time, but they ought to be adjusted now. Many men of small means have
                            been ruined almost by the loss of their property on account of these
                            raids. Senators from the north part of the State cannot fully appreciate
                            the position of citizens along the border. Those sufferers should be
                            paid for their losses, there is no question about that. If you leave it
                            to the General Government, as a matter of course it will be
                            procrastinated for a time, but these citizens cannot do without the
                            means they may be able to gather from the sale of their claims, and they
                            will turn round and sell them to speculators at a ruinous shave of
                            probably 75 cents on the dollar. Then these men who can afford to wait
                            upon the General Government will come in and line their pockets with the
                            money that ought to go to those men that have been injured. If the State
                            will assume and pay these claims, the General Government will without
                            doubt reimburse her. The authorities there will say "It is evidence
                            enough for us that these claims are just, to know that the State of
                            Indiana has paid them, we want to know nothing more; she ought to be
                            repaid." He did not know that any person in his d'strict had suffered
                            from these raids, but he knew the claims, of such as have ought to be
                            passed upon, and if found correct, they ought to be paid, and the best
                            way in his judgment, was to pay them out of the State Treasury, looking
                            to the General Government for the repayment of all moneys so
                            appropriated.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS. If the amendment should prevail, a man having lost a horse
                            by the rebel raids, and who would make out his claim and follow it up
                            till it got to Washington, it would not by that time be worth to him ten
                            cents on the dollar. He was inclined to be an old fogy and follow after
                            precedents, several of which he cited. Those people in the southern part
                            of the State met with their losses by the incursions of rebel forces
                            more than ten or twelve months ago, and it is certainly time that steps
                            were taken in the direction proposed by the bill now before the
                            Senate.
                        Mr. VAWTER, moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                        The yeas and nays were demanded, and being ordered and taken
                            resulted-yeas 13, nays 32-as follows:
                        
                        
                            
                                

                                    YEAS-Messrs. Allison, Bowman, Cobb, Dunning, Dykes, English,
                                        Gaff, Hord, Hyatt, Newlin, Oyler, Vawter, and
                                        Williams-13.
                                    NAYS-Messrs. Barker, Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Bradley, Brown,
                                        of Hamilton, Brown, of Wells, Carson, Cason, Chapman,
                                        Corbin, Cullen, Culver, Davis, Downey, Finch, Fuller,
                                        Gifford, Jenkins, Marshall, Mason, Moore, McClurg, Noyes,
                                        Peden, Richmond, Staggs, Terry, Thompson, Ward, Wood, and
                                        Wright-32.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the Senate refused to lay the amendment on the table.
                        On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the bill and the pending amendments were made
                            the special order-as in Committee of the Whole-for
                            Friday next at 2 1/2 o'clock P. M.
                    


                    
                        LEAVES OP ABSENCE
                        Were obtained for Messrs. Wright, Bonham, Niles, Corbin, McClurg and
                            Woods, till Tuesday, and for Mr. Milligan till Wednesday.
                    

                    
                        STATE AUDITING COMMITTEE.
                        Mr. DUNNING presented a voluminous report embracing the proceedings of
                            the Auditing Committee authored by the last
                            Legislature; which, without reading, was on his motion laid on the table
                            and 300 copies ordered printed, together with the report of the former
                                Auditing Committee.
                    


                    
                        RAILROADS.
                        On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the bill [S.
                                30] authorizing and confirming the sale of railroads, &c.,
                            (see page 44 of these Reports,) was taken up and referred to a select
                            committee of five, viz: Messrs. Vawter, Oyler, Hanna, Allison and
                            Dunning.
                    


                    
                         STATE UNIVERSITY BONDS.

                        Leave being granted, Mr. WILLIAMS introduced a bill [S. 128] making
                            appropriation for he payment of interest on the State University Bonds
                            for the years 1863 and 1864, which was read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS explained that these bonds were created some three years ago
                            in consequence of the Vincennes University having obtained a judgment
                            against the State University at Bloomington. The State assumed the debt,
                            issued these bonds, and they are now in the hands of the Vincennes
                            University. He read from laws heretofore enacted on the subject, and
                            asked as a special favor that the rules  be suspended, and the bill read the second
                            time now. The rules were suspended--yeas 37, nays
                            0--and the bill was read the second time.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS then appealed to Senators to suspend the rules again, read
                            the bill the third time, and pass it now. He made a motion in accordance
                            with this request.
                        Mr. ALLISON moved to refer the bill to the Committee on
                                Finance.
                        The latter motion was agreed to.
                    

                    
                        NUMBER OF MEMBERS.
                        Mr. CASON introduced a bill, [S. 129,] prescribing the number of Senators
                            and Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana,
                            which was read the first time and passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                        A RECESS TILL MONDAY.
                        On motion by Mr. CULLEN it was-
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns it
                                        be to meet on Monday next, at 2 o'clock P. M.

                            without this State, to authorize consolidated railroad companies to
                            consolidate again, to increase the capital stock of consolidated
                            railroad companies, to authorize them to borrow money and secure the
                            payment thereof, and to explain and declare the powers of consolidated
                            railroad companies formed by the consolidation of two or more railroad
                            companies under the laws of this State; which was read the first time,
                            and passed to the second reading.
                    

                    
                        NEW JUDICIAL DISTRICT.
                        Mr. HORD introduced a bill [S. 131,] to create and establish the 14th

                            the first time and passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. OYLER was not disposed to object to a bill on its first reading, but
                            would remark that this was a cool thing on his county.
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                        Mr. GROVES, from the Committee on Claims,turned the
                            claim of Morrison & Ray, for$714 reporting that said claim is

                                Committee on Ways and Means, be directed to place
                            the same in the Appropriation bill. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the motion so that the instructions shall

                        Mr. BOYD said that Ex-Governor Wright had employed these Attorneys on
                            behalf of the State--not as an individual.
                        Mr. HENRICKS said that the management of the causes committed to these
                            lawyers was not satisfactory.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. There was certainly no lack of qualifications.
                        Mr. Newcombs's amendment was rejected.
                        Mr. N. then proposed $250; which was also rejected.
                        Mr. Groves' motion was then agreed to, and so the claim was referred to
                            the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. VEACH, from the same committee, returned the claim of John H. Frazier

                         D. J. SILVER.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, submitted a resolution instructing the
                                Committee on Ways and Means to report to this
                            House to-morrow morning the claim of D. J. Silver, connected with work
                            on the State Prison North.
                        Mr. MILLER said some $27,000 was allowed to Mr. Silver two years ago, but
                            not paid yet for reasons understood. He now claims interest and damages.
                            He stated the hardships of the case, and offered to send accompanying
                            papers with the resolution to the committee.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The Committee on Ways and Means has never
                            received that claim.
                        Mr. MILLER moved that the resolution and papers go to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means, with instructions to
                            incorporate Silver's claim in the general appropriation bill.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The committee would obey the older of the House. Mr.
                            Silver's claim was only a part of the claim on account of the  Northern Prison, allowed last
                            session. He moved to refer the whole matter relative to these Northern
                            Prison claims to the Committee on Claims.
                        The latter motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered.

                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                        Mr GREGORY, of Warren, introduced a bill [H. R. 130] for an act to amend
                            section 784 of article 46, chapter first of the Practice Act, of June
                            18, 1852.
                        Mr. COFFROTH stated that he had introduced a bill of precisely similar
                            import, and that it bad been twice read and referred.
                        Whence-
                        On motion, by Mr. GREGORY, his bill was laid on the table.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB introduced a bill [H. R. 131,] for an act to amend section 3
                            of the act to amend the act to repeal all general laws for the

                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        Mr. FERRIS introduced a bill [H. R. 132,] for an act to amend section 117
                            of the Common School Act of March 11, 1861.
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Education.
                    



                    
                         D. J. SILVERS AND OTHERS.
                        Mr. BOYD. (by consent,) from the Committee on Claims,
                            retained the claim and accompanying papers, of David J. Silvers and
                            others, for $61,105 91 -embracing the entire amount of the indebtedness
                            of the State on account of the Northern Prison, and reported a bill [H.
                            R. 133,] for an act making an appropriation for that object.
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved that it be referred to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, stated that. Mr. Silvers charged $3,353 74
                            interest, since the 11th of March, 1863, and $3,300 damages for
                            excessive interest, which he had to pay on money borrowed by him,
                            because the State failed to pay him; and he moved to amend the motion
                            for reference, by instructing the Committee to allow the interest.
                        Mr. BOYD opposed the instructions. The Committee would not object to
                            allowing him 6 per cent, interest from the 11th of March, 1863, to the
                            time of payment.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said this matter ought to be considered when there is a fall
                            House. He preferred that it be passed over.
                        Mr. BROWN was not in favor of either motion. It was his judgment that we
                            ought to pay to Silvers the money due him with such interest as he has
                            had to pay to the banks. He moved to amend the motion of the gentleman
                            from Laporte, by instructing the committee to allow the rate of interest
                            he actually paid.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. The State had been borrowing money--had borrowed from the
                            counties, and from Winslow, Lanier and Co.--and himself and others had
                            thought it best not to allow interest to these creditors. But the
                            majority thought otherwise, and allowed interest; interest authorized by
                            the laws of the State of New York. He had thought it ought not to be
                            done, but would not complain now that it was done. But what was this
                            case? We have no evidence that Mr. Silvers has been straightened for
                            money. For these two years money has been abundant at all times. Men
                            could get it for six per cent., and even for less than six. It was known
                            also that when Mr. Silvers and these men contracted with the State-with
                            the Prison Commissioners-that the money was not appropriated to pay
                            them, and no prudent man would make such a contract without providing
                            for the contingencies of delay. He thought, therefore, that it would be
                            an act of gross injustice to pay Mr. Silvers the amount of damages he
                            asks for. He knew something about this claimant and his claims, and
                            therefore he hoped the motion of the gentleman from Clinton [Mr. Miller]
                            would not prevail.
                        Mr. BROWN stated the difference between this case, and that of
                            advancements by the counties to the Governor. The latter a case of  patriotic impulse-the former was a
                            contract in which the State was a party, and failed.
                        Mr. HIGGINS was in favor of the reference, bus without instructions. No
                            doubt Mr. Silvers had suffered. This money was not all due to Mr.
                            Silvers. The larger part would go to other contractors, laborers,
                            &c.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. Mr. Silvers made this contract with the commissioners of
                            the prison, when he knew the commissioners had no right to make it.
                            These claimants, when they made their contract with the commissioners,
                            knew that they could not be paid till the Legislature should make an
                            appropriation for that purpose. The commissioners even violated the
                            prison law in this matter. He was himself cognizant of the facts he
                            asserted. Replying to a question by Mr. Dunham, he said the contract
                            would be fully complied with, whether we pay interest or not. He was
                            opposed to the instructions.
                        Mr. COLLINS said the State was now receiving benefit from their prison
                            buildings. The Northern Prison paid money into the Treasury. He would do
                            what is right in the matter.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the motion to commit with instructions was laid
                            on the table.
                        Messrs. Higgins, Howard, Goodman and Willis obtained leave of absence
                            till Tuesday.
                        Mr. Griffith obtained leave of absence till Wednesday.

                        It was ordered to the third reading.
                        Mr. BOYD and Mr. LOCKHART submitted claims, which were referred to the

                        On motion of Mr. COFFROTH (the regular order of business being suspended)
                            the bill [S. 39] changing the times of Common Pleas Courts in Whitley
                            county, was taken up, read the second time by the clerk, and ordered to
                            the third reading.
                        On motion by Mr. WHITESIDE it was ordered that when the House adjourns
                            to-day it shall be till Tuesday morning, at 9 o'clock.
                        The House then adjourned. 
                    
                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         MONDAY, February 6, 1865. 
                    
                    The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR resumed the Chair at 2 o'clock p. M. and directed the
                        reading of the Secretary's journal of Friday's proceedings. The journal was
                        read and approved. 
                    
                        PERSONAL.
                        Mr. RICHMOND rose to a question of privilege. During the absence of the
                            Senator from Vanderburg [Mr. Finch,] his desk was moved by the
                            Doorkeeper without consulting that Senator. The Senator is an old man;
                            be is hard of hearing; he has been sent here by his constituents to
                            represent their interests upon this floor, and he desires to occupy a
                            position upon the floor of this Senate where he may hear and see and
                            know what is being done. By the consent of Senators at the beginning of
                            the session, his desk was placed adjoining the desk of the Senator from
                            Boone [Mr. Cason,] but it is now placed in a remote corner, where he
                            cannot see and cannot hear what is done. The rights of the Senator from
                            Vanderburg have been violated, and he requested as a special favor to
                            the Senator from Vanderburg, that the Senate shall order the desk of
                            that Senator to be placed in the position it has occupied from the
                            beginning of this session.
                        It was so ordered.
                        Mr. CASON disclaimed having anything to do with removing the desk of the
                            Senator.
                        Mr. FINCH. I exonerate the Senator from Boone, [Mr. Cason.]--I exonerate
                            him.
                    
                    
                        VALUATION AND ASSESSMENT.
                        Mr. RICHMOND, from the Committee on County and Township
                                Business, returned the bill [S. 118,] to amend section 23
                            of the Valuation and Assessment act. approved July 21, 1852, so as to
                            make its provisions more just and equitable; with a report recommending
                            its passage. Subsequently,
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill was read the second time and ordered
                            to be engrossed for the third reading.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time, and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        By Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, [S. 132.] to amend section 1 of an act to provide for
                            a general system of common schools, &c., approved March 11, 1861, by
                            striking therefrom these words: "Provided, however, that the taxes
                            aforesaid shall not be levied and collected from negroes nor mulattos,
                            nor shall their children be included in any enumeration required by this
                            act, nor entitled to the benefits of said act."
                        By Mr. WILLIAMS, [S. 133,] fixing
                            the time for holding courts in the Third Judicial Circuit.
                        By Mr. TERRY, [S. 134,] to amend sections 10 and 11 of an act tor the
                            election and appointment of supervisors of highways, &c., approved
                            March 5,1859; so as to increase the amount of labor on the public
                            highways, by increasing the pay par diem [from 75 cents to $1 50.] and
                            rendering exemption from such service more, difficult and expensive.
                        By Mr. DUNNING, (for the Lieutenant Governor,) [S. 135.] to amend section 71 of
                            an act granting to the citizens of the town of Evansville, in the county
                            of Vanderburg, a city charter, approved June 27, 1817, and add
                            supplemental sections to the act.
                        By Mr. CASON, [S. 136,] to amend sections 8 and 11 of an act to provide
                            for a more uniform mode of doing township business, approved February
                            18,1859.

                            gas, providing for the inspection thereof, declaring a forfeiture of
                            bills therefor in certain cases, and declaring an emergency. 
                        By Mr. CASON, [S. 138,] to amend section 30 of an act regulating the fees
                            of officers and repealing former acts in relation thereto, approved
                            March 2, 1855; making it incumbent 
                            upon each county to furnish fuel, stationery and office room for their
                            sheriffs as well as other officers; by inserting at the proper place in
                            the above named section the words "and sheriff's."
                    


                    
                         AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES.
                        
                        
                        The following message was received from His Excellency, the Governor, by
                            the hand of his private secretary, B. R. Sulgrove, Esq.

                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                         To the General Assembly of the State of
                                            Indiana:
                                    
                                     I have received from the Secretary of State of the United
                                        States a copy of a joint resolution of Congress, passed by a
                                        vote of two-thirds of each House, entitled, "A resolution
                                        submitting to the Legislatures of the several States a
                                        Imposition to amend the Constitution of the United States,"
                                        which is in the following words:
                                    
                                        
                                            

                                                "Resolved by the Senate and House of
                                                  Representatives of the United Slates, in Congress
                                                  assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses concurring,)
                                                  That the following Article be proposed to the
                                                  Legislatures of the several States as an amendment
                                                  to the Constitution of the United States, which,
                                                  when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths
                                                  of said States, shall be valid to all intents and
                                                  purposes, as a part of the said Constitution,
                                                  namely:
                                            
                                        
                                    
                                    
                                        "ARTICLE XIII."
                                    
                                    SECTION 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except
                                        as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been
                                        duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any
                                        place subject so their jurisdiction.
                                    "SEC. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by
                                        appropriate legislation, approved February 1,1863."
                                    Indiana as a post of the North-Western Territory, was
                                        preserved from the curse of slavery by the Ordinance of
                                        1787. That ordinance laid the foundation of the State in
                                        freedom, from which it has surely and rapidly grown.
                                    The population, wealth and prosperity of the State as well as
                                        of the other States of the North-West, fully attest the
                                        beneficence of free institutions, and our hearts should
                                        swell with gratitude for the wisdom and patriotism of our
                                        forefathers for bequeathing to us the legacy of liberty.
                                    In the process of time and by the dispensation of Providence,
                                        it has become the privilege of the people of Indiana, acting
                                        through the forms of the Constitution, and in harmony with a
                                        large majority of the people of the United States, to extend
                                        the rich blessings they have enjoyed, to the States and
                                        Territories that have been less fortunate.
                                    The slavery question is presented in a form hitherto unknown
                                        in our politics.
                                    It is not a question as to the right of Congress to exclude
                                        slavery from the Territories, nor of the people of the
                                        Territories, to legislate upon the subject themselves, nor
                                        does it involve the discussion of any doubtful powers, but
                                        is the simple proposition to amend the Constitution of the
                                        United States in the manner prescribed by itself, so as to
                                        strike down the monster wrong which has embroiled the nation
                                        for more than half a century, and culminated in a rebellion
                                        without parallel in history for its wickedness and waste of
                                        blood and treasure. The existence of slavery has ever cast a
                                        dark shadow over the whole land. When we have coasted to the
                                        Old World of a Government established upon the doctrine of
                                        inherent equal rights, the despotisms and aristocracies
                                        contemptuously replied, that under it human flesh was bought
                                        and sold as merchandise. To this we had nothing to answer.
                                        It not only has dishonored us abroad but it has poisoned our
                                        domestic peace, setting neighbor against neighbor and State
                                        against State, until by its last great act of wickedness it
                                        has committed a crime for which there is no forgiveness, and
                                        for which it must die.
                                    In the great opportunity now presented we discern the hand of
                                        Providence, which often accomplishes its purposes through
                                        the wickedness and folly of mankind.
                                    Slavery, always criminal and insolent from its smallest
                                        beginning, bloated with impunity, and success, will perish
                                        during the war it created to enlarge its power and
                                        perpetuate its existence.
                                    Let us hasten to acquiesce in this great result by ratifying
                                        the action of Congress, and thus become a party to the
                                        righteous deed, in accordance with the unquestionable wishes
                                        of the people.
                                    
                                        O. P. MORTON,
                                        Governor of Indiana.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         ADDITIONS TO COMMITTEES.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR asked and obtained leave to add Mr. Brown, of
                            Wells, to the special committee on Railroad Appraisement.
                        Mr. DUNNING moved to add Messrs. Cullen and Richmond to the
                                committee on State's Prisons.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to amend by adding Messrs, Culver and
                            Cobb.
                        Mr. DUNNING accepted the amendment. 
                        Mr. HANNA, on looking over the Senate, was inclined to think there would
                            not be a quorum while the committee was absent, should these Senators be
                            added. These trips were generally sight-seeing excursions, and while he
                            was willing to lend his vote to gratify any Senator who desires to go,
                            he could not lend his vote to dissolve the Senate at this stage of
                            proceedings.
                        Mr. THOMPSON was glad the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Hanna] had made the
                            remarks he did. The Senate must take some means to insure the attendance
                            of Senators. We have not been full ( for nearly a week, and we must stop
                            going home if we will do business. He supposed it would be doubtful if
                            to-morrow we have a constitutional quorum here, judging from what ha saw
                            this afternoon. He thought four or three members would be as well on
                            this committee as twenty or twelve.
                        Mr. HANNA, having been on a similar committee once, was frank enough to
                            say that they passed through Michigan City without stopping, and went to
                            Chicago.
                        Mr. RICHMOND was not surprised that the Senator from Marion [Mr.
                            Thompson] opposed this motion, and had no doubt that the Senator from
                            Marion desired the institution at Jeffersonville should be well taken
                            care of. As far as Mr. R. was personally concerned he had no special
                            desire to go on this trip, but the people north of the National road,
                            and especially in his part of the State, desired to know something about
                            this institution. He would like to go for the sake of his constituents
                            and see how the thing was managed. 
                        
                         Mr. BENNETT'S experience in going with a committee to visit the Southern
                            Prison was "that, instead of stopping at Jeffersonville, they went over
                            to Louisville, and stopped at the Galt House, and he never learned that
                            there was any report made from that committee. He believed that as you
                            increase the committee in number you increase its inefficiency.
                        Mr. RICHMOND. The fact that the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Hanna] and the
                            Senator from Union [Mr. Bennett,] went to Chicago and Louisville on a
                            spree should not be used as an argument here. Because they did not do
                            their, duty is no reason why some other gentlemen will not do
                            theirs.
                        
                        The yeas and nays were demanded on the motion to increase the number of
                            the Committee on the State's Prison, and being ordered and taken
                            resulted--yeas 15, nays 15.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, No quorum voting. The Constitution says I shall
                            vote whenever there is a tie, so I will vote "no," whether it has any
                            effect or not. [Laughter.]
                        Mr. HANNA moved that the Senate adjourn.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. OYLER demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered and being taken the Secretary reported twenty
                            absentees.
                        On motion, by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, further proceedings under the call
                            were dispensed with.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved that the Senate adjourn.
                        
                        The motion was rejected upon a division--affirmative 14, negative 15.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved that the Senate adjourn.
                        Whereupon--
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR declared the Senate adjourned.
                    
                

                
                
                     IN SENATE.
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 7, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate a communication transmitting
                        the 13th annual report from the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                    
                        LICENSING THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.
                        Mr. OYLER presented a petition from numerous citizens of Johnson county,
                            praying for such a change in the liquor law as shall compel the
                            applicant to obtain the signatures of a majority of voters in the
                            neighborhood, city, town or township, to his petition for a license, so
                            that no license shall be granted unless a majority of the voters are in
                            favor of it. The petition was referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance.
                    
                    
                        FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the following Select Committee
                            on the part of the Senate, authorized by Mr. Beeson's
                            resolution, printed on page 134 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, viz:
                            Messrs. Beeson, Niles and Cobb.
                    
                    
                        AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the order of business was suspended, and the
                            Governor's Message transmitted to the Senate yesterday afternoon, was
                            taken from the table.
                        He said that the message had just been read n the journal, and be would
                            not insist upon its being read again, as it was printed in the morning
                            papers. He merely wanted it taken from he table that he might introduce
                            a joint resolution [S. 16,] accepting and ratifying certain amendments
                            to the Constitution of the United States proposed by Congress to the
                            Legislatures of the several States. 
                        The joint resolution was read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        UNSKILLFUL PRACTICE OF MEDICINE.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS presented a petition from numerous citizens of Whitley
                            county, praying the passage of a law fixing the standard of
                            qualifications of practicing physicians and surgeons, and suggesting
                            that all persons desirous of practicing without a diploma from some
                            respectable medical college, should be compelled to procure from a
                            county board of medical censors a license in writing.
                        The petition was referred to the Judiciary
                            Committee.
                    
                    
                        INDIANA REPORTS.
                        Mr. COBB, from the Judiciary Committee, returned the
                            bill S. 101 (see page 125 of these Reports,) recommending its passage
                            with an amendment allowing additional pay for volumes 21 and 22. The
                            report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        EXEMPTING PROPERTY OF SOLDIERS.
                        Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT:-The Judiciary
                                Committee, to which was referred resolution or the Senate
                            [see page 96 of the BREVIER LIGISLATIVS REPORTS] instructing the
                            committee to inquire into the expediency of passing a law exempting the
                            property of soldiers from execution while absent from home in the
                            service of the United States, have had the same under consideration, and
                            are of opinion that such a law would be of doubtful constitutionality on
                            account of its partaking of the character of special legislation. The
                            committee also think that such a law could not be made to apply to
                            contracts which have already been made.
                        The committee are glad to be able to state that they know of no necessity
                            for the passage of such law. They have not known or heard of any case
                            where the property of any soldier, absent from his home, and engaged in
                            the service of his country, has been sold on execution.
                        The public sentiment on this subject is such that there is not likely to
                            be any sacrifice of the property of persons so honorably and so laudably
                            engage.
                        They therefore recommend that the said resolution be laid on the
                            table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of the bill [S. 91,] amending
                            section 108 of the Practice Act, and the bill [S. 128,] paying interest
                            on the State University bonds for 1863-64.
                    
                    
                        OUR SOLDIERS IN SOUTHERN PRISONS.
                        Mr. BENNETT submitted the following: 
                        MR. PRESIDENT: The Committee on Military
                                Affairs, to whom was referred Senate Joint Resolution, No.
                            14 [printed in full on page 131 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,]
                            concerning the exchange of prisoners, beg leave to report that they have
                            had the same under consideration, and have instructed me to report,
                            that, while they are deeply sensible of the terrible sufferings that our
                            brave officers and soldiers 
                            soldiers have endured while confined in the prisons of the enemy, and
                            while your committee regret the delay that has occurred in effecting the
                            exchange of these gallant men, yet they are unable to discover
                            sufficient facts upon which to base the censure, that seems to be
                            implied in the joint resolution, against the authorities of the
                            Government. Without expressing any opinion as to the cause of the delay
                            in the exchange of such prisoners, your committee are fully satisfied
                            that the Government is using every effort in its power to effect an
                            exchange, and to speedily release the brave men who are confined the
                            prisoners of the enemy, and suffering the barbarous and inhuman
                            cruelties inflicted upon them by the devilish ingenuity of malignant
                            traitors. 
                        The committee recommended passage of the joint resolution with an
                            amendment striking out the preamble.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading:

                            June 17, 1852, so as to make competent witnesses "any party defendant to

                            regarded only as to his or her credibility, and shall not effect his or

                        By Mr. DOWNEY, [S. 148] to amend sections 76 and 88 of an act providing
                            for the settlement of decedents' estates, &c.
                        Pending the introduction of bills-
                        Mr. DOWNEY (when he introduced the bill S. 144) said: I have a bill,
                            which was prepared and handed to me by another, relating to a house of
                            correction for juvenile offenders, and which I desire to introduce. I
                            wish to be understood as; favoring the general objects of the bill, but
                            I do not wish to commit myself to its details.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that, while he very cordially concurred in the
                            importance of establishing a house of refuge for juvenile offenders, he
                            rose now at the threshold, to enter his protest against the scheme of
                            selling any of the lands owned by the State in the vicinity of
                            Indianapolis. The time may come when, they will be of great value to the
                            State, and when the want of them could not be supplied. Except for a
                            clause in the present Constitution, prohibiting it, he did not doubt
                            that the Governor's Circle, and other small public grounds in this city,
                            would before this time have been sold or permanently leased, as, before
                            the adoption of the new Constitution, the Legislature was constantly
                            pressed with petitions for that purpose. He favored the sale of the
                            Governor's house and grounds, as they could not longer be useful to the
                            State; but he desired to meet and resist the very first proposition to
                            sell any of lands owned by the State, in the neighborhood of this city.
                        
                    

                    
                        CIRCUIT AND COMMON PLEAS JUDGES.
                        Mr. NILES offered the following: 
                        Resolved, That the Committee on the
                                Organisation of Courts be instructed to inquire into the
                            expediency and necessity of enacting a law prescribing the time within
                            when, persons elected to the office of Judge of the Circuit or Common
                            Pleas Courts shall qualify, and ia default of their qualifying within
                            the prescribed time, that there shall be a vacancy in the office, and
                            that said committee report by bill or otherwise. The resolution was
                            adopted.
                    
                    
                        CITY IMPROVEMENTS.
                        Mr. NILES offered the following resolution, which was adopted by
                            consent:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Corporations be instructed to inquire into the
                                        necessity and expediency of extending the provisions of an
                                        act entitled "An Act touching the laying out and vacating
                                        towns, streets, alleys, public squares, and grounds or any
                                        part thereof; the making cut and recording of plots of such
                                        towns, and providing for the changing of the names of such
                                        towns," approved March 20, 1852, to cities. And especially
                                        to inquire as to the propriety of extending the principles
                                        of the 8th section of paid act to the streets and alleys of
                                        cities, in all cases where such streets or alleys are
                                        vacated under any law of this State, and that said committee
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NILES stated for the information of the committees to which these two
                            resolutions were directed, that they were drawn up by the Lieutenant
                            Governor, and were offered at his request.
                    
                    
                        SCHOOL EXAMINERS.
                        Mr. DYKES offered the following, which was adopted by consent:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Education be requested to inquire what
                                        legislation is necessary to promote the efficiency of School
                                        Examiner, to provide for their more adequate compensation,
                                        and to attach a penalty
                                        for neglect of duty, and that they report by bill or
                                        otherwise. 
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
                        Leave being granted, Mr. BENNETT introduced a joint resolution [S. 17,]
                            in regard to the prosecution of the war. The resolution recites that
                            whereas the telegraph asserts that rebel commissioners have refused to
                            treat for peace except their independence recognized, therefore this
                            Legislature recommends that the President call out a sufficient force to
                            compel all these in rebellion to obey the Constitution and laws and
                            restore the union of the States.
                        The joint resolution was read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        THE INDIANAPOLIS SENTINEL.
                        Mr. BONHAM offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS A resolution was adopted at the
                                        commencement of the present session, instructing the Door
                                        keeper to contract for and place upon the desks of Senators
                                        three copies of the Indianapolis Daily Journal and three
                                        copies of the Indiana Daily State Sentinel, two of each, to
                                        be wrapped and stamped for mailing : Provided, said papers publish the proceedings of
                                        the Legislature; and,
                                    WHEREAS, The Indiana Daily State Sentinel
                                        does not contain the proceedings of the Legislature in an
                                        intelligible form, and that the proprietors thereof have
                                        failed to comply with the only condition upon which said
                                        papers were taken by the Senate: therefore,
                                    Resolved, That the Door-keeper of this
                                        Senate be and is hereby directed to inform the proprietors
                                        of the said Daily Sentinel that from this time forward,
                                        unless the proceedings of the Legislature are published more
                                        fully in said paper, that this Senate will be induced to
                                        rescind said contract and order the discontinuance of the
                                        placing said papers on the desks of Senators.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. HANNA moved to lay it on the table, but withdrew for-
                        Mr. BONHAM said he was not influenced by party considerations in offering
                            this resolution. His attention was first called to this matter by
                            Democratic Senators. He had been in the habit of exchanging his
                            Sentinels for the Journals of gentlemen on the other side of the House,
                            but in consequence of the meager reports in the former paper, they had
                            informed him that they could not any longer exchange with him. He
                            insisted the Sentinel folks had failed to comply with the condition upon
                            which we agreed to take their paper, and he was in favor of informing
                            them that if they did not make more complete reports we will rescind the
                            contract. If they cannot afford to give a larger amount of space to the
                            legislative proceeding, we can not afford to take their papers any
                            longer.
                        Mr. HANNA would like to see these reports improved. It is well known that
                            the reports in these papers are scarcely an epitome of the transactions
                            here every day, but he supposed they gave up space as far as their means
                            allow, and was willing to presume that was the fact for both the Journal
                            and the Sentinel.
                        Mr. COBB was getting tired of this whole thing of reporting the
                            proceedings of the Legislature, unless it was done better. He never made
                            a speech yet, in which there was a prominent point, but that it was
                            skipped over by the reporter. He could see some reason for the
                            resolution--that the Sentinel had not reported the proceedings of this
                            body as full as it should have done--not as full as the Journal--and
                            that was part of the contract. He would like to spur up the reporter a
                            little, too.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS moved to amend the resolution by inserting "the Journal and
                            the Gazette, and giving them two days to reform." 
                        
                        The amendment was rejected by yeas 13, nays 24-as follows:

                        Pending the roll call-
                        Mr. BENNETT said the Journal reports suited him well
                            enough, and he was not going to censure either paper.
                        Mr. BONHAM, when his name was called, repeated that, this was not a
                            partisan question with him. He thought the Journal published the
                            proceedings of the Legislature as full as their space would permit, but
                            did not think so of the Sentinel.
                        Mr. COBB was sorry to see an indication that he would not have much
                            company in this vote. The reports of the proceedings of this
                            Legislature, as they appear in the papers of this city, is an entire
                            failure with the exception of the titles of bills and joint resolutions.
                            As far as the points made in debate are concerned, he found the most
                            prominent debates which take place in this end of the Capital are
                            entirely left out. He very often saw Senators placed wrong upon the
                            record. The Senator from Laporte, [ Mr. Niles] who is always careful
                            about his language, is quoted as having made use of words that have a
                            different meaning from the words he used in debate here. It is probable
                            our reporter can avoid this, but if he can't, I must say the reports are
                            faulty as far as this is concerned. They are valuable as far as the
                            business we do goes, but as far as argument or debate is concerned they
                            amount to nothing. He voted "aye" for the purpose of causing these
                            gentlemen if they can to improve.
                        Mr. CULVER, when his name was called, said he thought the reports in the
                            papers were a thousand times better than the speeches made in this hall.
                            [Laughter.] 
                        Mr. DOUGLAS. It may be the Sentinel reports are not so full as the
                            Journal, but the Gazette and the Sentinel stand upon an equality as far
                            as that is concerned; and believing the papers were all about alike he
                            wanted, if we put one out, to put all out--put all out, or keep all in.
                            He was in favor of keeping them all just as they are.
                        Mr. NILES would have preferred that the resolution had not been offered;
                            but, being called upon to vote on it, he disavowed the remotest iota of
                            partisan feeling in reference to the question. He should vote against
                            the amendment with a view to voting against the original resolution. It
                            must be confessed that the reports are not perfect; but it seemed to him
                            that the history of our Legislative Proceedings is pretty well given;
                            and, where speeches are necessarily so very greatly condensed, the whole
                            spirit of the speech can be given. He had observed the same thing the
                                 gentleman from Lawrence had
                            spoken of; but very generally attributed these errors to misprints which
                            are notorious throughout the Western country, where hardly anything can
                            be printed correctly. In saying this, he did not intend to cast any
                            unjust reflection on the printers. But he hardly ever had anything of
                            his own printed, without being greatly mortified by typographical
                            errors. He really thought such mistakes occurred more frequently in that
                            way than ought to be attributed to the reporter.
                        Mr. OYLER--when his name was called.--While he did not suppose the
                            Senator from Blackford had any partizan feeling in introducing this
                            resolution, he recognized the difficulty under which our reporters labor
                            in this matter. When he looked over the papers, and noticed his own
                            remarks, he was surprised that they reported him as well as they did. He
                            had been astonished at the respectable appearance of his speeches in
                            print. While he thought our reporters often make us say things we never
                            thought of, be considered they did as well as anybody could under the
                            circumstances. As he expected to vote against the original resolution,
                            he should vote no upon this amendment.
                        Mr. RICHMOND-when his name was called-said he should oppose the amendment
                            for two reasons: In the first place, the reports published in the
                            Journal are about as large again as those in the Sentinel. In the second
                            place, the Gazette was taken after a debate, and with the understanding
                            that we take but one copy, that we might get the afternoon news; and it
                            was not expected of it to make very full report of the proceedings of
                            the Legislature. If Senators were to hear the resolutions read again,
                            they would not consider it a censure. It informs the editors that,
                            unless they make a more full report, we will rescind, the contract.
                        Mr. CULLEN said: For the first time this session be had been convinced by
                            a speech on this floor that he was in error. He was satisfied by the
                            explanation of the Senator from Tippecanoe (Mr. Culver,) that he voted
                            wrong on this question, [laughter,] and he desired to change his vote to
                            the negative.
                        So the amendment was rejected.
                        Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend the resolution so as to call the attention of
                            the editors of the State Sentinel to the meagre report of the
                            proceedings of this body, and a request that they report the proceedings
                            more at length hereafter.
                        
                        The amendment was rejected-yeas 15, nays 22.
                        Mr. BRADLEY moved to lay the resolutions on the table.
                        Mr. COBB suggested that the Senator from Blackford [Mr. Bonham] withdraw
                            his resolution, and that the Reporter be requested to report these
                            proceedings in full, and the report would have the same effect that the
                            resolution would have if adopted.
                        
                        The motion to lay on the table was agreed to by yeas 28, nays 11.
                        Mr. DUNNING explaining, said the resolution would do some good, whether
                            laid on the table or not. In his observations of reporting, the reports
                            had been worse during the present session than ever before, but he
                            thought the fault was not so much with the editors as with the
                            reporters, and that was the most he desired to say. He considered the
                            whole reporting business this session a nuisance, and at the close of
                            the session, when the opportunity is given him to vote on the
                            appropriation of money in this matter, unless they are improved, he
                            should put himself upon the record against giving to the people any such
                            reports.
                    
                    
                        JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
                        Mr. CULLEN offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                            Committee be instructed to inquire into the
                                        expediency of limiting the number of Justices of the Peace
                                        to one in each township, and extend their jurisdiction in
                                        civil actions throughout the county, and report by bill or
                                        otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        RELIEF OF SOLDIERS' FAMILIES.
                        The bill H. R. 14 (see pages 142, 143, and 145 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                            REPORTS) was read the first time.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. BEESON the rules were suspended--yeas 38, nays 0--and
                            the bill was read the second time by title only and referred to the
                                Committee on Finance. 
                    
                    
                        SESSION HOURS.
                        On motion by Mr. GABON it was- 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn that
                                        it do 10 until to-morrow at 9 o'clock A. M.

                            (see page 83) were read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                         RAILROAD DIRECTORS.
                        On motion by Mr. RICHMOND, his bill 130 (see page 156 of these Reports)
                            was read the second time by title only and referred to the
                                Judiciary Committee.
                    

                    
                        THE MILITIA.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, his bill 113 (see page 134) was taken from the
                            table and referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 7, 1865.
                    
                    The Clerk called the House to order at 9 A. M., and nominated Mr. Newcomb as
                        presiding officer.
                    The nomination was taken by consent, and
                    Mr. NEWCOMB assumed the chair.
                    On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the reading of the journal of Saturday was
                        dispensed with.
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        Mr. ATKINSON presented the petition of sundry citizens of Fountain and
                            Montgomery counties, praying against any increase of the compensation of
                            State and county officers: which was read and referred to the
                                Committee on Fees and Salaries.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the House a communication from Morrison
                            & Ray, attorneys, with reference to the action heretofore taken on
                            their claim against the State.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the memorial and the report be recommitted to the
                                Committee on Claims.
                        It was ordered.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted sundry claims, and (without reading) they were
                            referred to the Committee on Claims.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. GROVES and Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims
                            reported back sundry claims of J. B. Osgood, recommending that they be
                            allowed, and incorporated in the specific appropriation bill.
                        The report was concurred in, and referred to the Committee on
                                Ways and Means.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the same committee, returned the claim of Milton H. Roll
                            & Smith, recommending its allowance, which was referred to the
                                 Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. COOK, from the Committee on Manufactures and
                                Commerce, returned his tobacco warehouse bill No, 106,
                            recommending its passage without amendment.
                        Mr. STIVERS, from the Committee on County and Township
                                Business, returned Mr. Howard's bill, No. 53, to amend
                            sections 5 and 14 of the County Business Act of Feb. 18, 1859, with
                            amendments, striking out all that relates to section 5, and in the
                            amendment to section 14, striking- out "250" and inserting "200."
                        Mr. BANTA, from the same committee, returned Mr. Ferris's bill [H. R.
                            42,] to amend sections 9, 11, and 14 of the county business act, of
                            February 18, 1859,-recommending that it lie on the table-it being the
                            opinion of the committee that such change in the law is inexpedient and
                            unnecessary.
                        The report was concurred in by unanimous consent.
                        Mr. SHUEY, from the Committee on Temperance, returned Mr. Harrison's
                            Liquor bill, No. 33, and Mr. Kilgore's Liquor bill, No. 93, recommending
                            that both lie on the table, and submitting a new bill.
                        These reports lie on the table under the rule. 
                    
                    
                        BREVIER REPORTS.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, from the select committee to consider the memorial relative
                            to the Brevier Legislative Reports, (now in press from the daily reports
                            of the proceedings and debates of the General Assembly in the
                            Indianapolis Journal,) reported the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Doorkeeper be directed
                                        to contract with A. & W. H. Drapier for five hundred
                                        copies of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS being the usual
                                        number furnished for the House every session since 1857- the
                                        same to be sent by express, an equal number of copies to
                                        each member as soon as possible after the adjournment of the
                                        session; Provided said Reports shall not
                                        cost more than two dollars per copy; that one copy for each
                                        member be bound, and and that said Reports shall not be paid
                                        for until printed.
                                    Resolved, That paid contract is made on the
                                        express condition that said Reports shall contain a full,
                                        accurate verbatim report of the speeches made in the House,
                                        and such statement of bills, joint resolutions and
                                        amendments thereto as will be sufficient to make them
                                        understood; and the House hereby reserves the right to
                                        rescind this contract on the failure of the said Drapiers to
                                        comply with any of the conditions of this contract.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the report be laid on the table; and it was so
                            ordered by unanimous consent.
                    

                    
                         AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES.
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY submitted a resolution for an order to print 300 copies of
                            Mr. Whiteside's joint resolution, No. 13, ratifying the constitutional
                            amendment abolishing slavery throughout the United States, for the use
                            of the House of Representatives.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK and Mr. NEWCOMB, thinking that this resolution and the
                            message on the same subject had been sufficiently printed h the
                            newspapers--
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY withdrew the order.
                        A message was now received from the Governor, by Mr. Sulgrove, his
                            Private Secretary, communicating the joint, resolution of the Congress
                            of the United States, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the
                            United States for the exclusion of slavery. [It was printed yesterday in
                            these reports.]
                        Mr. GROVES moved that the matter of the message be made the special order
                            for next Tuesday.
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed to make it Tuesday week.
                        Mr. WOODS proposed to make it the special order for to-day at 2 o'clock.
                            It was an important matter.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. It was certainly a matter of great and grave importance. It
                            should be fully and calmly discussed.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, The matter doubtless would elicit considerable discussion,
                            and it was better first to get through with the pressing business of the
                            session. He did not wish to avoid the question at all, or any
                            responsibility that might be connected with it.
                        Mr. BONNER, It was certainly an important question, but it was not a new
                            one. Not a man here but that had his mind made up with regard to it. He
                            moved to make it the special order for Thursday morning.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Better to "hasten slowly."
                        Mr. BROWN prepared to make it the special order for two weeks hence. He
                            hoped the joint resolution by Mr. Whiteside would also be made the
                            special order for the same day with this. It would pass the House, but
                            that was no reason for hurry-it was indeed a good reason for giving
                            opportunity for debate.
                        Mr. SHUEY. It would be doing injustice to his own political friends to
                            press the matter in a hurry. Nothing would be lost by delay. He
                            accounted it an honor to be permitted to vote on this question, and was
                            willing to see it receive a half day's earnest discussion. Then he
                            wanted to see every man come to the record.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, was in favor of better progress in legislation.
                            He did not want this Legislature to deserve the reputation of being the
                            slowest in the Union. Absentees would rush in when they saw that this
                            question was pending. He preferred the order to be made for
                            Thursday.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that Mr. Whiteside's resolution be taken up and made a
                            epecial order for the same day.
                        Mr. DUNHAM accepted Thursday, and the House acquiesced. 
                        So the whole subject was made the spedial order for Thursday morning.
                         Mr. Patterson and Mr. Prather had leaves of absence on account of
                            sickness.
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill [H. R 134] for an act requiring the Boards

                            respective counties who may be charged with receiving a greater amount
                            of fees than he is legally entitled to receive, to determine the amount
                            thereof, (if any,) and to cause suit to be brought for its recovery: 
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the

                        Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill [H. R. 137] for an act to enable the
                            qualified electors of this State, and absent therefrom, in the service
                            of the United States, to vote:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. HUNT introduced a bill [H. R. 138,] for an act to amend the act
                            providing a Treasury System for the State of Indiana, &c., approved
                            March 5, 1861:
                        Which was passed to a second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on County and Township Business,
                        Mr. SHUEY introduced a bill [H. R. 139 ] for an act to amend sections 3,
                            4, 5, 7, 9 and 11 of the Liquor law, approved March 5, 1859; and
                            prohibiting the owners and keepers of saloons, coffee-houses, &c.,
                            from erecting or keeping any screen or blind, and prescribing penalties
                            therefor in case of a second or subsequent conviction:
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        On motion by Mr. SHUEY, it was ordered to lie on the table, and that
                            three hundred copies thereof be printed.
                        Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill [H. R.
                                140,] for an act ratifying the action of the Governor in
                            settling and discharging the State's quota of the direct tax levied by
                            the Congress in 1861, and authorizing him to settle all unsettled claims
                            of the State against the United States:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the 
                                Committee on the Judiciary.

                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted that this bill was an important one, (as every
                            lawyer would see,) affording facilities in amendments of pleadings,
                            taking depositions, and especially in cases of changes of venue, and he
                            submitted a motion to suspend the constitutional restriction, to admit
                            of the second reading now.

                            connecting and branch roads, and to operate and maintain the same:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the

                            Superintendent of Public Instruction(printed report.)
                        Also, the Superintendent's answer to Mr. Rice's resolution, with
                            reference to the amount of idle school funds. He reports the amount
                            $238,000, in round numbers, and refers to his printed report for
                            particulars.
                        A message was now received from the Governor by Mr. Sulgrove, his Private
                            Secretary, transmitting a letter from the Secretary of State of the
                            United States, enclosing a letter from the Hon. Justin S. Morrell, with
                            reference to the act of Congress constituting the Old Capitol Hall a
                            National Gallery of Statuary.
                        On motion of Mr. THACHER, the message and papers were referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        HABEAS CORPUS.
                        Mr. GROVES submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    
                                        WHEREAS, There is now no law on the
                                        statute books of the State of Indiana requiring a judge of
                                        the court to go out of the county where he resides to hear
                                        or grant a writ of habeas corpus, unless his fees be paid by
                                        the parties before hearing said cause; and whereas, many
                                        poor persons are made to suffer from the injustice of this
                                        rule; therefore
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            the Judiciary be instructed to inquire into
                                        the propriety of passing a law compelling judges to hear
                                        such cases at any point in their respective districts, and
                                        allowing the county commissioners to make sufficient and
                                        proper allowance to such judges for hearing such cases; and
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion of Mr. DUNHAM, it was referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        WHITLEY COURTS.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the House proceeded to the considerations of
                            the regular order of business on the calendar.
                        

                        The Senate engrossed bill No. 39,
                            changing the time for holding courts in Whitley county, was passed the
                            final reading without amendment in the House of Representatives--yeas
                            68, nays 0. 

                    
                    
                         LOCAL BOUNTY LEVIES.
                        


                        The Senate engrossed bill No. 3,
                            To legalize the issuing of bonds and making appropriations for the levy
                            and collection of taxes in certain cases, coming up on the third reading
                            with amendments reported by the Judiciary  Committee, striking
                            "townships" from its first section and adding to the second section the
                            following:
                        Provided, That, in all cases where one or more
                            townships of a county have relieved the township of any given draft
                            without any appropriation in aid thereof from the county, and any debt
                            shall have been contracted by the action of the County Commissioners to
                            pay bounties to relieve the residue of the townships from such draft,
                            the taxes hereafter levied for the payment of the principal or the
                            interest of said indebtedness, shall be levied only on the property and
                            polls liable to taxation in the townships for whose benefit such debt or
                            debts were incurred; and the townships which had so filled their quotas
                            before such indebtedness was created, shall be exempted from such
                            taxation.
                        And provided further, That the provisions of the act
                            shall not be construed to cover or include debts contracted by
                            individuals to relieve themselves from any draft that has heretofore
                            taken place; nor shall the same be construed to authorize the assumption
                            or payment of such debts by any county, town or city; but the provisions
                            of this act are intended to apply to the action of counties, towns and
                            cities which have acted through their legally entitled authorities, and
                            have issued their orders, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness to
                            raise money to pay bounties to volunteers or drafted men who have
                            entered the military service.
                        And when so amended, the committee recommend the passage of the bill.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK considered that the first clause of the amendment was in
                            violation of the State Constitution. It provided that if any township
                            shall have relieved itself from the draft by voluntary contributions,
                            and the county afterwards levy a tax to pay bounties, such township
                            shall be relieved from such levy on property and polls; but it shall be
                            assessed only on the property and polls of those for whose benefit the
                            debt was contracted. The State Constitution provides that "the General
                            Assembly shall provide by general laws for an equal rate of assessment
                            for taxation," &c. He showed at length the unconstitutionality of
                            the amendment, and the court decisions bearing on the question.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said this bill came in here from the Senate, with the
                            assumption that these acts of the local and county authorities,
                            contracting local debts for bounties, are illegal, end it was a
                            proposition to legalize them. He showed the necessity of these local
                            acts, end the complete equity of the proposition in the amendment, that
                            the tax levied for the benefit of particular townships shall not be
                            collected off the polls and property of another township. He replied to
                            the reference to the constitutional restriction, giving it the
                            construction, that it refers solely to assessments for taxation for
                            State purposes. The gentleman's construction would overthrow very much
                            of our legislation since 1852. He believed the amendment was
                            constitutional. He knew it was just and right, and was willing to leave
                            the constitutional question with the courts.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, would have the tax uniform. The Constitution
                            requires this. But individuals who have paid money for bounties, and
                            filled their township quota, upon proper proof should be allowed a
                            credit therefore not exceeding in amount the special tax for this
                            purpose. So justice would obtain, and the constitutional provision would
                            not be infringed. He proposed to substitute for the committee's
                            amendment, a proposition to the effect that any person or persons who
                            have advanced money to relieve their respective townships from any
                            draft, on former calls for troops, shall be allowed credit for the same
                            on the payment of the taxes that may be assessed against them, upon
                            satisfactory proof before the County Commissioners: provided such amount
                            shall not exceed the amount of special tax assessed against them.
                        Mr. KILGORE proposed to so amend the first section of the bill, that no
                            appropriation made for this purpose since the 15th day of December,
                            1864, shall be legalized, which was read for information.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was ordered that the bill and pending
                            amendment be referred to a Select Committee.
                        
                        The Senate pension roll joint resolution, No. 5, (see page 50 of these
                            Reports,) coming up, it was ordered to the third reading, read the first
                            time, and passed the House of Representatives--yeas 67, nays 0.
                    


                    
                         D. J. SILVER.
                        Mr. BOYD moved to dispense with the further consideration of the regular
                            order of business in the calendar, to enable the House to take up the
                                Claims Committee's bill, No. 133.
                         Pending which motion--[at 12:25 P. M.]--
                        The House adjourned till to-morrow morning, nine o'clock. 
                    
                



                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        WEDNESDAY, February 8, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were being read, when-
                    On motion of Mr. BONHAM, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    
                        FREE TURNPIKES.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK presented a petition from citizens of Bartholomew and
                            Decatur counties praying for the enactment of a law authorizing the
                            levying of taxes for the construction of free turnpikes; which was
                            referred to the Committee on Roads and Highways.
                    
                    
                        A NATIONAL GALLERY.
                        A message was received from the Governor by Mr. Sulgrove, his Private
                            Secretary, transmitting a letter from the Secretary of State of the
                            United States, enclosing a letter from Hon. Justin S. Morrill, with
                            reference to the act of Congress constituting the Old Capitol Halls
                            National Gallery of Statuary. 
                    
                    
                        COUNTY TREASURER'S BOND.
                         Mr. TERRY, from the Committee on Lands, returned
                            Senate bill 104, recommending its passage. The report was concurred in.
                        
                    
                    
                        CLAIMS OF INDIANA AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.
                         Mr. CULLEN introduced a bill [S. 149 ] ratifying the action of the
                            Governor in settling and discharging the State's quota of the direct tax
                            levied by Congress in 1861, and authorizing him to settle all unsettled
                            claims of the State against the United States, which was read the first
                            time, and passed to the second reading. 
                    
                    
                    
                        LEGALIZATION OF APPRAISEMENTS.
                        The bill [H. R. 84,] legalizing certain acts of the Board of
                            Commissioners of Vermillion county and District and State Boards of
                            Equalisation-adopting the appraisement of 1859-was read the first time
                            and passed to the second reading.
                    

                    
                         WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                        Senate bills numbered 119, 120,
                            121, 123,124, 125, 126 (see page
                            138 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) 129, 131 (see page 156,) 132,
                            134, 135, 136, 138 (introduced
                            day before yesterday,) 139, 140, 141, 143, 144, 146, 147, 148 (introduced yesterday.) were read by
                            title only, and referred to appropriate committees.
                    
                    
                        FEES AND SALARIES OF OFFICERS.
                        Mr. DUNNING submitted the following:
                        
                            Mr. PRESIDENT : The Select
                                Committee to which was referred Senate Bill No. 67,
                            entitled "An Act to regulate the fees of officers, and repealing former
                            acts in relation thereto," have had the same under consideration. The
                            Committee are aware of the importance of the subject referred to them,
                            and especially of the difficulty of adjusting the provisions of the Bill
                            to suit the views of the officers interested. The Committee have not
                            been able to agree unanimously upon all the provisions of the bill. The
                            Committee have instructed me to report the same luck to the Senate with
                            a recommendation to strike out all of the original Bill after the
                            enacting clause and insert the following amendment, and the Committee
                            further recommend that the proposed amendment and Bill be laid upon the
                            table and printed. 
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING 100 copies of the Committee's substitute for the
                            bill were ordered to be printed, and the consideration thereof was made
                            the special order for Tuesday next at 2 1/2 o'clock.
                    
                    
                        GERMAN IN OUR COMMON SCHOOLS.
                        Leave being granted, Mr. HORD offered the following resolution:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Judiciary
                                            Committee be instructed to devise some measure
                                        whereby our German citizens may derive some benefit from the
                                        Common School Fund in inculcating the German language, and
                                        that it report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. HORD said almost a majority of the inhabitants of the State are of
                            foreign extraction, a frugal, industrious and thrifty people, devoting
                            themselves to the culture and improvement of the State. A large common
                            school fund is annually collected from this class of our citizens, and
                            they are shut out from its benefit by the proscriptive provisions of an
                            unequal and oppressive enactment. Their language and literature have
                            been shackled by the formula and limitations of our common school
                            system. They came among us with a foreign lingo and literature, and it
                            is not reasonable to expect that they will forsake a literature and
                            language with which their youth and manhood, their earliest emotions,
                            conceptions and recollections are intimately associated. Shall they
                            pluck from memory their language? forsake their natures? Bury their
                            hearts in forgetfulness as the price of citizenship and habitation in
                            the State. The language of a people is the exponent of that people's
                            feelings and thoughts. It is a part of their nature and existence, and
                            every German feels that it is praise enough to nil the ambition of a
                            privateman that Schiller's language was his mother tongue. I would be
                            pleased to see the German language taught in our common schools. Its
                            literature would be as refining as useful. It seems that the past
                            Legislatures have called up from the vasty deep the spirit of a
                            barbarous age, and invoke its aid in laying a heavy band on the language
                            and literature of a noble race, and have strived, with a vandal and
                            oblivious hand, to wipe it from the hearts and memories of its owners.
                            It is just that something should be done, and I shall insist upon some
                            relief to them, though I shall remain alone and as companionless as the
                            last cloud of an expiring storm, in my persistence in this measure.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK asked if the gentleman was aware that the law as it now
                            stands provides that the German language may be taught in our common
                            schools?
                        Mr. HORD believed there was nothing that really extends the right
                            affirmatively.
                        Mr. OYLER realized the force of the appeal made by the honorable Senator;
                            but while admitting the justice and propriety of all contributing to the
                            school fund receiving therefrom that to which they are entitled, still
                            the question is not to be decided upon that ground alone. While he fully
                            realized that love which exists in the breast of every man for the place
                            of his nativity, he also realized it to be the duty of every man when he
                            makes the United States his home, to denationalize himself from former
                            home associations, and become part and parcel of this great country-to
                            Americanize himself, so to speak-and he knew of no one thing more
                            calculated to do that than to keep our common schools almost exclusively
                            American. His position in this regard was well known, and he would not
                            be thought as opposing the rights and privileges of our German friends
                            in the position he assumed.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the resolution out of order as a similar
                            resolution had been reported adversely upon by a committee of the
                            Senate, and the Senate had concurred in the report of the committee.
                    

                    
                        BILLS ORDERED ENGROSSED.

                        Senate bills [122] relating to weights and measures; [127] fixing the
                            boundaries of Lawrence and Johnson counties; [133] third Judicial Circuit
                            Courts; and [145] providing compensation for Common Pleas Judges in
                            certain cases; were read the second time and passed to the third
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        DRUNKENNESS.
                        The bill [S. 142] proposing to fine drunkards not less than $1 nor more
                            than $50, was read the second time.
                        Mr. COBB said the spirit of the bill may be a good one, but he was afraid
                            it would operate harshly upon a good many of his constituents,
                            [laughter,] as well as the constituents of the Senator across the way,
                            [Mr. Woods.] He was not prepared to say he was willing to punish men for
                            being drunk in the way proposed by this bill.
                        Mr. CULLEN was opposed to drunkenness, and he was opposed to this bill
                            also. He objected to it for the reason that it does not define what
                            drunkenness shall consist of. It was not  good policy to pass a bill having no other
                            provisions than are contained in this one.
                        Mr. DOWNEY thought there was a necessity for a law upon this subject. If
                            we concede the right to individuals to become intoxicated, boisterous
                            and insulting, it is enough that they carry on these things so as not to
                            interfere with the rights of others. If Senators have any objections to
                            the form of this bill, he hoped they would suggest them by way of
                            amendment, or let it be referred to a committee that it may be
                            perfected. A former Executive recommended the passage of a law upon this
                            subject, and Mr. D. agreed in the views expressed at that time. Among
                            the acts which constituted a nuisance, there are none more offensive or
                            deserving of more punishment by the laws of the State than that of open
                            drunkenness.
                        Mr. OYLER concurred in the remarks made by the Senator from Ohio, [Mr.
                            Downey.] This kind of crime is an outrage--a great and growing evil,
                            which should not be allowed to go unrebuked; but there is a necessity
                            for more distinctly defining the offense. In many of our cities and
                            towns we have sometimes ordinances enforced punishing drunkenness, and
                            it is just as necessary there should be a general law throughout the
                            State punishing this offense. No man will argue the right or propriety
                            of an individual becoming intoxicated and making a beast of himself; or
                            worse than a beast-for a beast is not guilty of that. We should ask men
                            to protect themselves, and if they will not, the coercion of the law
                            should compel them.
                        Mr. McCLURG had no objections to making this bill more specific, but
                            apprehended a great deal of difficulty in setting down what will
                            constitute the offense of drunkenness so as to meet every particular
                            case. The courts will have to determine for themselves whether this or
                            that man was drunk or not, and that is something that can be
                            ascertained. That there is a necessity for this law every man must
                            concede. This bill is one step in the right direction, because it visits
                            the penalty on the head of the offender who outrages the sense of
                            propriety and decency wherever he is seen.
                        Mr. NILES said he was gratified by the remarks of the three last
                            Senators, and was in favor of the object of the bill. It seemed to him
                            to be a step in the right direction. All will agree that a drunken man
                            at a railroad station, or in any place of public resort, is an offense
                            against public order and is intolerable to children and ladies. The bill
                            does not propose to punish a man for being found drunk in his own house
                            or gutter, but to abate a public nuisance. The bill proposed to deal
                            with the drunken man as a free and rational being-to punish him for
                            being publicly drunk, and to let him have time to reflect when sober. He
                            desired that the bill might be perfected if in any respect defective;
                            but it occurred to him that the word "drunk" is its own best definition.
                            It is as well understood as any household word.
                        Mr. CULLEN was far from opposing the object of the bill. He wished to be
                            understood as endorsing the spirit of the bill, and also the remarks
                            that have been made in regard to this growing evil. He should vote for
                            the bill, but his objection arose from the fact that it did not
                            sufficiently describe the offense. He cited a case where the Supreme
                            Court recently declared invalid an act because it did not fully describe
                            the offense which it was the purpose of the act to punish. He also
                            referred to the growing evil on the part of policemen, who drag men
                            before the courts when there is in reality no necessity for it. He
                            desired that the bill should go to some committee and be perfected, so
                            that if it becomes a law it may not be declared unconstitutional and
                            void.
                        Mr. BENNETT would like to see an amendment incorporated in the bill
                            directing that the fine imposed upon the drunkard should be paid by the
                            man who sold the liquor. He would not give his vote to impose a fine
                            upon any man who has this habit and thus take from his wife and children
                            what they have but little of-money to live on. We ought to strike at the
                            very root, and not at the poor, unfortunate drunkard. If you allow the
                            liquor saloons to be licensed then you recognize them as a proper place
                            to drink in, and if a man goes into them as a matter of course he
                            expects to meet drunken men there. He was opposed to men getting drunk
                            on the cars, at churches and other public places, and if the crime be
                            properly defined he should vote for the bill, at the same time doubting
                            the propriety of striking at the victim and licensing the man who makes
                            him such.
                        Mr. CASON had always been in favor of stringent laws upon the Temperance
                            question, so much so as to be regarded as a little fanatical on that
                            point; but before we strike at a man who is in the habit of becoming
                            intoxicated, we should reflect. It is questionable whether he could
                            support this bill. Drunkenness is unquestionably a disease, and to some
                            extent you might just as well fine a man for wilfully violating the laws
                            of health as to fine a man for becoming drunk. And it is not only a
                            disease, but in a short time it assumes the form of insanity. And now
                            you propose to punish a man diseased in this way and insaned by disease.
                            We leave our land open to pestiferous holes, we license them, and to a
                            certain extent, legally and socially we encourage these habits. And our
                            land is not only covered with these, but some drug stores are the worst
                            kind of doggeries. But we don't stop here: our land is covered with
                            physicians who deal out these swill slops to their patients when they
                            are in the very worst condition to encourage the habit of drunkenness.
                            He knew men that if you were to penitentiary them every week, would not
                            stop it. The only possible chance to get rid of this evil is by social
                            influence; by such laws being brought to bear as will prohibit the
                            indiscriminate use of alcoholic liquors in public and by physicians, and
                            then establish an asylum where men can be treated for the cure of this
                            habit.
                        Mr. NILES remarked, in order not to be misunderstood, that so far from
                            seeking to shield the dram-shops by punishing drunkards he would go for
                            any reasonable measure tending to check the greater evil.
                        On motion by Mr. DOWNEY the bill was referred to the  Judiciary
                                Committee. 
                    
                    
                    
                        THE AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES.
                        The joint resolution [S. 16]
                            accepting and ratifying certain amendments to the Constitution of
                            the United States proposed by Congress to the Legislatures of the
                            several States, was read the second time.
                        Mr. BENNETT moved that the joint resolution be made the special order for
                            Friday morning at 9 o'clock.
                        Mr. HANNA said this was the most important question ever before this
                            Legislature, and he would prefer that the consideration of it be put off
                            till next week, so that every Senator may be notified of the time and be
                            in his seat. He moved to amend the motion.
                        Mr. CULLEN suggested Wednesday week.
                        Mr. HANNA accepted.
                        Mr. OYLER thought we were as well prepared at this moment to discuss this
                            question as we win be. States in the East, in the West and in the North,
                            have already acted upon it, and he was unwilling the noble old State of
                            Indiana should be the last in the race. If we postpone this question
                            till the longest time proposed, it will then be in the end of the
                            session, when business will be hurried through, and it will not meet
                            with that favor it deserves. He preferred that it should be considered
                            tomorrow, and hoped the other amendments would be voted down.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to amend the amendment by making the joint
                            resolution the special order for this afternoon.
                        Mr. DUNNING was anxious that the Senate should be full when this subject
                            shall be considered, and concurred fully in the remark of the Senator
                            from Vigo, [Mr. Hanna,] that this is probably the most important
                            question ever considered in the Senate of Indiana. While he wes anxious
                            to see every Senator upon the record on this question, he was unwilling
                            to see such an important measure as this postponed to such a late day in
                            the session as was proposed by the Senator from Vigo and the Senator
                            from Rush, [Mr. Cullen.] There is a great deal of business to be acted
                            upon, and if this question should be postponed we may never get ready to
                            consider it. The people demand that this question should be settled, and
                            the rebels should know that there is but one sentiment in the Northern
                            States upon the matter. As has been remarked, he did not want to see the
                            noble State of Indiana laggard in responding to the wishes of the
                            people; and hoped the motion of the Senator from Decatur, [Mr. Van
                            Buskirk,] would prevail.
                        Mr. COBB suggested that as this act was the result of such a rapid change
                            in the minds of members of the present Congress, it were better not to
                            follow hastily. The Constitution of this country is no ordinary matter.
                            It is a beacon light to the people of this country; they should obey it
                            and not make changes in it unless there is an important and inoperative
                            demand that it should be made. It would require the Legislatures of
                            about twenty-seven States to indorse this amendment, before it will bean
                            amendment to the Constitution, and there are not that many in
                            session-there are but twenty-three that will meet any time soon. Hence
                            it could not be adapted as a part of the Constitution at a very early
                            day, and we only show a want of deliberation, by hastily acting upon it.
                            There were seven Senators absent on important duty, in compliance with
                            the rules of the Senate, to visit the Northern Prison, and it is our
                            duty to pass this measure over, not only till they get home, but till
                            they get their minds composed and have time to reflect. So far as
                            discussion was concerned, this Senate has not spent much time in that
                            way. But upon a question of this kind, it was a duty to hear every
                            member that desires to express himself, and, if possible, his
                            language-his ideas-the sentiments he entertains with regard to this
                            important proposition-should go to the country. He thought he could see
                            where this thing wag drifting, and here was another reason why we should
                            not act hastily. He could read public sentiment too well to expect that
                            this excitement would last. It would react and rebound again. It was
                            only ten or fifteen years ago that 90,000 people were in favor of a
                            certain provision of our Constitution, which to-day is alleged to be a
                            dead letter on the statute book.
                        Mr. BENNETT called the Senator to order. He was getting in a speech ahead
                            of us.
                        Mr. COBB. We have important matters of legislation before us, and he
                            thought it best to postpone this subject for a few days. He confessed
                            that he bad not given sufficient thought to the subject to enable him to
                            convey to the Senate his opinions.
                        Mr. BEESON. This was an important question, and by no means a new one. It
                            had been before the country for years. He was satisfied of one fact,
                            that if we wanted hasty legislation we ought to defer this question to
                            the latter end of the session. That was his experience here. The time
                            designated would throw it into a period when, perhaps, no measure of
                            such importance, would receive the consideration it deserves at the
                            hands of the Senate. For the purpose of bringing the matter to a close,
                            he moved that the amendment and the amendment to the amendment be laid
                            on the table.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 20, nays 19-the Lieutenant Governor
                            voting in the affirmative.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend by making the joint resolution the special order
                            for Wednesday next at 2 1/2 o'clock.
                        On motion of Mr. CHAPMAN, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 20,
                            nays 18.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS demanded the previous question.
                        The demand was seconded by 33 Senators. The question being, "Shall the
                            main question be now put?"
                        
                        It was so ordered by yeas 36, nays 0.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the next question to be: ''Shall the
                            joint resolution be engrossed for the third reading tomorrow?"
                        Mr. BENNETT appealed from the decision of the Chair.
                        The question being, "Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the
                            judgment of the Senate?"
                        Pending which, came the recess for dinner.
                    
                    


                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        Mr. BENNETT submitted his appeal from the decision of the Chair in
                            writing, as follows :
                        The President of the Senate having decided that whenever the previous
                            question is seconded, and the main question ordered, pending a motion to
                            postpone, the motion to postpone is cut off, from which decision the
                            Senator from Union appeals.
                        
                        The decision of the Chair was sustained, by yeas 26, nays 13.
                        
                        The joint resolution was then ordered to be engrossed, by yeas 20, nays
                            19.
                         Mr. BENNETT moved that the joint resolution be read the third time next
                            Friday, at 9 o'clock A. M , and that it be made the special order for
                            that hour.
                        Mr. HANNA moved to amend by substituting Tuesday, at 2 1/2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. BEESON, the amendment was laid on the table--yeas 20,
                            nays 19.
                        On motion of Mr. COBB the motion [Mr. Bennett's] was laid on the table by
                            yeas 21, nays 18.
                        Mr. BEESON moved to make the resolution the special order for 9 o'clock
                            to-morrow morning.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend by substituting Wednesday of next week at 2 1/2
                            o'clock, P. M.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BEESON the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 21,
                            nays 18.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS moved to amend by substituting Thursday of next week at 2 1/2
                            o'clock, P. M.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. CASON the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 20,
                            nays 19.
                        Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.
                        Mr. HORD moved so amend by substituting Monday at 2 1/2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 21,
                            nays 19.
                        Mr. BEESON then withdrew his motion and moved to consider the joint
                            resolution as engrossed, suspend the rules and read it the third time
                            now.
                        Mr. HANNA was not prepared to vote upon this question now, because he
                            desired to give to his constituents the reason for his vote, and the
                            great motive that, will control my action will be that while I live and
                            while I breathe, by no act or vote of mine, will I ever lay my hand upon
                            one word, letter or line written by Madison and that body which framed
                            the Constitution of the United States. He desired time to prepare
                            reasons.
                        
                        The motion. [Mr. Beeson's,] was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 19.
                        Mr. HANNA made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.
                        Mr. BEESON moved to postpone the further consideration of the joint
                            resolution till Friday morning at 9 o'clock.
                        On motion of Mr. COBB this motion was laid on the table by yeas 31, nays
                            8
                        Leave being granted, Mr. CASON offered the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns
                                        that it do so until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        The resolution was adopted by yeas 21, nays 19.
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT made an ineffectual motion yeas 12, nays 28-to reconsider the
                            vote by which the resolution was ordered to be engrossed.
                        Mr. OYLER. From the remarks of the Senator from Vigo, [Mr. Harma,] he was
                            induced to say that he was not one of those who thought all wisdom lies
                            buried in the grave. He recognized and realized the circumstances that
                            surrounded our fathers when they adopted the Constitution. An
                            institution foreign to the spirit and purpose of the government was
                            accepted as an incubus and a blot; but it was there, and it was for the
                            fathers to do the best they could with it as they found it. They could
                            not have maintained their position before the world had they then
                            blotted out this hated institution of slavery. This is the only and the
                            real reason why the institution was allowed to have an existence at the
                            time it became a part and parcel of the compromises of the Constitution.
                            In my political life it has been my fortune to recognize this principle
                            and to contend that it ought not to be interfered with directly or
                            indirectly. I was willing to leave it as it was-to leave it to the
                            progress, of public opinion-to the march of truth and right, of
                            rectitude and justice, and hope for that day when the hearts of the
                            American people should rise above the sordid consideration of dollars
                            and cents.
                        By stealthy and insidious steps friends of the institution asked to
                            extend this foul blot over the territories, and at last undertook to
                            spread it beyond its limits. Then I, with thousands of others, demurred.
                            Then I thought it right to answer to the convictions of my early
                            education, and say, "thus far shalt thou go, and no farther." And I have
                            no hesitation in saying, I know the motives and influences that actuated
                            me, that, had the advocates of this institution let it stay where it
                            was, no voice or vote of mine would have been raised against it. To
                            slavery, and to slavery alone, can be attributed the loss of so many
                            valuable lives, and so much treasury and to it may be charged this foul,
                            wicked and unjust rebellion. Had there been no slavery in the United
                            States, there would have been no rebellion in 1861. Believing that
                            slavery is justly and truly chargeable with all these wrongs and that as
                            long as it has a place on our statute book--as long as it is not openly
                            condemned this country can have no permanent or certain peace. I am one
                            of those that will ba proud to give my vote to ratify the amendment
                            which has been passed by the Congress of the United States.
                        Every Senator and all the people may not look at this matter as I do.
                            Some may think the causes of this rebellion are in a different
                            direction. But I venture the remark that, no matter how extended this
                            debate may be, or in what direction any honorable Senator may place the
                            causes, if he runs it, back to the original source, he will land where I
                            have landed and fix it upon the institution of slavery as the great
                            moving cause. I need not call attention to that wonderful march of
                            public feeling on this topic. It is astonishing that this stream pouring
                            so strongly in one direction. Public opinion has almost resolved itself
                            into one voice in this matter. 
                        
                        Men who, a few short months or years ago were bitterly opposed to any
                            interference with slavery, to-day stand ready to vote its utter and
                            complete annihilation. The voice of inexorable destiny has spoken and
                            said, slavery is dead; and like all dead things, it ought to be buried
                            out of the sight of honest men. We could not save this institution if we
                            would, and. as far as I am concerned, I would not save it if I could,
                            Nor shall I be found a silent or tearful mourner around its grave. I
                            have no tears to shed over its demise. It has raised its hand against
                            our country, and it has no right to ask quarters at our hands. It has
                            sought to destroy our institutions and almost caused good men to pause
                            with fear and astonishment, lest Samson-like, it should pull down the
                            pillars of the temple and bury us all in its ruins.
                        I am firmly established in the hope that this resolution will be adopted
                            by this Legislature. I am not only willing but anxious that my
                            constituents shall know how I feel upon this subject. I flatter myself,
                            however, that must of them know how I feel, and how I will vote upon it,
                            I expect to recur, with fond recollection, to the placing of my vote in
                            favor of ratifying this resolution as it passed the two Houses of
                            Congress. I thank God that I am permitted to live till I can not only
                            rejoice in the feet, but that it is my good fortune to have a seat here,
                            and a voice in recording my name in a public manner in favor of this
                            proposition. We have always indulged in the poetic sentiment that this
                            is "the land of the free and the home of the brave." and now we can
                            almost put our hand upon the epoch of time when we can say that in
                            fact.
                        I admit that constitutions are sacred things. They ought not to be
                            changed for light and trivial causes. These questions ought to be
                            approached in a spirit of reverence. We ought not to lay our hands on
                            the work of our fathers, unless we are absolutely certain that the
                            country will be better far making the change. This measure has received
                            the sanction of every class of partizine. Has it not been properly
                            considered and discussed? Why, it has been before the people for the
                            past twelve years. We have heard it discussed in season and out cf
                            season. Who, then, will say the people are not ready for it? Whilst I
                            admit that the minority have rights, and their wishes are entitled to
                            due consideration, it is still their duty to submit. The majority have
                            rights; and one of these rights is, to change the organic law whenever
                            in their opinion the necessity to do so shall exist.
                        It seems to me that members of the Democratic party ought to hate the
                            institution of slavery, regarding it with a holy horror. If slavery bad
                            done as foul wrong to me and mine as it has to the Democratic party, I
                            should hasten to put it out of existence; and this seems to have been
                            the feeling of some men who claim to belong to that organization.
                        Mr. O. spoke in this vein to the close of his remarks: and when he had

                        The Senate adjourned.
                    
                


                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        WEDNESDAY, February 8, 1865. 
                    
                    The House met at 9 o'clock. A. M.

                        The SPEAKER announced the following special committee on the bill from

                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted sundry claims, which were referred without

                            the supreme authority of the Lord Jesus Christ:
                        Mr. McVEY presented the memorial of Rev. A.. L. G. Hay and other citizens
                            of Indianapolis, of similar purport:
                        Which were severally referred to the Special Committee on
                                Constitutional Amendments

                        Mr. WHITESIDE presented the remonstrance of the attorneys in Cass County

                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. MILLER, from the Committee on the Organization of Courts of
                                Justice, returned the bill, [S. 12,] authorizing creditors
                            to bring action before their paper is due, recommending its passage:
                        He also returned the bill, [S.
                                55,] fixing the Common Pleas Terms in the 5th district,
                            recommending its passage.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, returned Mr. Ferris's School bill [H. R. 132]
                            reporting that the committee will present a new school bill this week
                            embodying its provisions, and recommending that Mr. F.'s bill be laid on
                            the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    

                    
                         THOMAS COLEMAN.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                            the bill for the relief of Thomas Coleman, reporting that there be
                            allowed to the said Thomas Coleman the sum of $199 73.
                        Mr. HENRICKS moved that it be referred to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means, with instructions to put it into the
                            appropriation bill. He explained that Coleman purchased a piece of swamp
                            land for this money from the county of Tippecanoe, and was ousted by a
                            Mr. Elisworth, holding title under the United States. It was a question
                            with many whether the money should be paid out of the State or county
                            treasury. He thought it should be repaid by the county. There was a bill
                            allowing Coleman this money with interest, which the committee rejected,
                            agreeing to repay only the original purchase money.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB argued that it should be paid by the county.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, supported the recommendation of the committee.
                            Tippecanoe county never received that money.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the matter  back to the committee, with instructions to report a bill that the
                            county of Tippecanoe repay the money.
                        Mr. SHUEY was informed that Tippecanoe never got a dollar of the money,
                            but that it was absorbed--confiscated by dishonest State officers. He
                            proposed to amend the instructions so as to provide that the county of
                            Tippecanoe shall repay the money to Coleman, provided they have received
                            it.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB modified his instructions that the committee inquire into the
                            fact.
                        Mr. HENRICKS suggested the difficulty in the way of making such
                            inquiry.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB withdrew his motion.
                        Mr. WOODS' understanding was, that the condition of the swamp land fund
                            was, that the money was here in the State Treasury, standing to the
                            credit of the several counties.
                        Mr. Newcomb's motion, renewed by Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe, was finally
                            adopted.
                        Mr. LOCKHART, from a minority of the Committee on Railroads, reported an
                            amendment to Mr. Newcomb's railroad bill [No, 59] recommending its
                            passage.
                        Mr. STRINGER, from the Committee on Roads, to whom was referred the
                            resolution of Mr. Montgomery for a modification of the Road law, so that
                            road work shall be done earlier in the season, and Supervisors may pay
                            more than 75 cents a day for work on the roads, reporting that such a
                            modification of the law is now pending, and that the resolution be laid
                            on the table.The report was concurred in.He, also, from the same
                            committee, returned Mr. Goodman's resolution authorizing county boards
                            to open highways; recommending that it be laid on the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. LOCKHART, from the Committee on Manufactures and
                                Commerce, returned Mr. Cook's tobacco inspection bill [H. R. 122,] recommending its
                            passage.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE, from the Committee on Public Printing,
                            returned Mr. Montgomery's resolution for a bill authorizing
                            county-newspapers to publish the laws, reporting a bill.-- He also
                            reported a bill based upon the newspaper publishers' Memorial.
                        Which reports severally lie on the table.

                        COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe, be added to the

                        EVANSVILLE WAREHOUSE.
                        The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of engrossed bills
                            from the Senate.
                        The joint resolution, [S. No. 10,]
                            relative to the establishment of a bonded tobacco warehouse in

                        The bill [S. 23] to amend section
                            26 of the misdemeanor act of June 14, 1852, comic g up on the third

                        On motion by Mr. TRUSLER, the vote was reconsidered, and pending a motion
                            to correct a clerical error-
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the bill was referred to a select committee,
                            with instructions to give its provision a general applications.
                    

                    
                        SCHOOL FUND.
                        Mr. Gregory, of Warren's, school fund loan bill [H. R. 38,] coming up,
                            with the amend-  [amend]ments
                            reported by the Committee on Education--the
                            amendments were adopted.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that it be referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary, with instructions to invest this school fund in
                            State bonds. 
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, and Mr. SPENCER opposed the motion.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB contended that such an investment of the fund would be best
                            for the interest of the fund, and of the State at large.
                         Mr. BROWN. The object was that the fund should be so distributed in
                            loans, as to accommodate the greatest number in every part of the State.
                            To invest in bonds would be to derive the people of these accommodations
                            of loans. He was also opposed to the bill. The security would be
                            generally better for sums of $300 than for sums of $1,000.
                        Mr. STEWART hoped the reference would be made. The fund was lying idle in
                            his county. Men were not willing to execute mortgage security for so
                            small a sum as $300. The reason for the $300 loans had passed away.
                        Mr. BRANHAM hoped that the House would take no decisive action on the
                            bill at present. There was a proposition pending in the Finance
                                Committee of the Senate for the better management of all
                            the public trust funds. He could demonstrate that five per cent, on our
                            State bonds would be better than the nominal seven per cent, under the
                            present system. Numerous borrowers of this school fund had been broken
                            up. It was better to bring all our funds home.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB modified his motion so as to refer the bill to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. SPENCER spoke in favor cf the bill. Its object was to give the poor
                            man a chance as well the rich. Now the poor were better off and wanted
                            more money, hence the reason for the bill.
                        Mr. BROWN still thought with the President of the United States, that a
                            small debt was easier paid than a large one. He moved to lay the whole
                            subject on the table, but withdrew for-
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, the author of the bill. He had introduced it at
                            the earnest re quest of petitioners. The extension of the amount to
                            $1,000 did not preclude loans of $100 or any amount less than $1,000. He
                            was opposed to investing in State bonds.
                        Mr. RHOADS said this question would have to come up again in its
                            connection with another bill. He therefore moved to lay the subject on
                            the table.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to-affirmative 40, negative 28.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay his motion
                            on the table.
                         The latter motion was rejected.
                        Mr. B. then withdrew the motion to reconsider.
                    
                    
                        PRACTICE.
                        Mr. MILLER of Clinton's bill [H. R. 64] to amend the 405th section of the
                            general practice act [allows a judgment to be kept alive by renewing the
                            execution] coming up, it was read the second time, and ordered to be
                            engrossed for the third reading. 
                    
                    
                        ATTORNEY'S LIEN.
                        Mr. MILLER of Clinton's attorney's lien bill [H. R. 67] was read the
                            second time and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                    
                    
                         SAMUEL H. PATTERSON.
                        
                        The Finance Committee's bill [H. R. 72] for the relief of Samuel H.
                            Pattarson-it appropriates $2,091 34--coming up, it was read the second
                            time by the Clerk,
                        Mr. HENRICKS proposed to amend by allowing Patterson an additional sum of
                            $300 for expenses incurred by him on account of attorney's fees in the
                            case.
                        It was agreed to; and so the bill was ordered to be engrossed.
                        The joint resolution for the relief of George W. Archer, [H. R. No. 11,]
                            coming up, it was read the second time by the Clerk--it appropriates
                            $50--and was ordered to be engrossed.
                        Mr. Newcomb's witness bill [H. R.
                                19] coming up, it was read a second time by the Clerk.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said this was a bill amending the witness act of
                            1881--protecting the interests of widows and orphans. Now, a party
                            bringing suit against an estate may come in himself and testify. The
                            object of the bill was to prevent the plaintiff in such cases from being
                            a witness. It places the law in regard to widows and heirs just where it
                            is now in regard to administrators. He moved to suspend the
                            constitutional restriction.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to--yeas 49, nays 23--and then on his further
                            motion the bill was considered as engrossed, ordered to third reading,
                            read the third time and passed the House of Representatives--yeas 75,
                            nays 2.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved an order for an afternoon session this day.
                        The motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered. 
                        On motion by Mr. RHOADS the House then took a recess till 2 o'clock, P.
                            M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and doubting in the
                            matter, the roll-call ascertained that there was present a quorum to do
                            business.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the Committee on Elections
                            had leave of absence for the remainder of this day.
                        Mr. Brown and Mr. Miller, of Clinton, also obtained leave of absence for
                            the day.

                        
                            SPECIAL COMMITTEES.
                            
                            
                            The SPEAKER announced the following Special Joint Committee
                                    on Security of Insurance: Messrs. Shuey, Coffroth and
                                Chambers.
                            Special Committee on Statuary: Messrs. White,
                                Hogate, Brown, Rhoads and Emerson.
                            Mr. Woods' enclosures bill, No. 29, coming up, it was read the second
                                time and ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Burns' exemption bill, No. 31, coming up, it was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. Newcomb's soldiers' deposition bill No. 32, coming up, it was
                                ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Harrison's descents' bill, No. 33, coming up with the amendment,
                                reported by the Committee on the Organization of Courts of
                                Justice-inserting appropriately words to this effect: "and there
                                being no children of the de- 
                                [de]ceased husband from whom the property came to the widow."
                            Mr. DUNHAM. The amendment leaves it where the law now is. The
                                amendment is right.
                            On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on the Judiciary.
                            Mr. Kilgore's practice bill [No. 55] coming up-
                            Mr. DUNHAM made an ineffectual motion to lay it on the table. He saw
                                not why these deputies and officers may not practice law as well as
                                practice tillage. There was a good reason why a Clerk should not
                                practice law. He was for the largest liberty in this, under the
                                Constitution, which made every man a lawyer de legis
                                if not de facto. Professionally, he feared
                                nothing on the score of competition from lawyers de
                                    legis. God made lawyers de facto the
                                Constitution the other class.
                            Mr. SPENCER knew Clerks now engaging in law practice.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. The decision on the law of 1843 made them
                                incompetent.
                            Mr. DURHAM. So far as Clerks were concerned, he concurred in the
                                bill.
                            Mr. SPENCER thought the practice of law was just as incompatible with
                                the position of county auditor, or county treasurer, as with the
                                position of county clerk.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK saw little propriety in including county treasurers in
                                the bill. There certainly were clerks engaged in law practice. In
                                friendliness to the bill he proposed to add words to this
                                effect:
                            "Provided, That any person holding any of the
                                offices hereinbefore stated shall be permitted to close up the
                                business they are now engaged in. But this shall not include
                                permanent business, nor shall such persons be permitted to engage in
                                any new business."
                            Mr. DUNHAM moved to refer the bill to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary, with instructions to provide therein, that
                                no officer having the custody of records or papers wherein litigants
                                are interested shall be an attorney.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK thought it should be further provided that no officer
                                should be permitted to practice in the county where he resides.
                            The bill and pending amendments were then referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee, without
                                instructions.
                            Mr. Coffroth's Conciliation Court Bill, No. 43, coming up, with a
                                favorable committee recommendation, it was read the second time and
                                ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                            Mr. Meredith's Road-toll Bill, No. 49, coming up, it was read and
                                ordered to engrossment.
                            Mr. Stivers' Assessment Bill, No. 52, coming up, it was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Howard's Township Election Bill, No. 53, coming up, with the
                                committee's amendment reported yesterday-
                            Mr. DUNHAM opposed the amendment, which strikes out the provision
                                increasing the term of the office of township trustee to two
                                years.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, and Mr. FERRIS, concurred with Mr.
                                Dunham.
                             Mr. LOCKHART supported the amendment. He spoke of the case of an
                                incompetent trustee in his county. Such should not be fastened on
                                the people by law for two or four years.
                            Mr. RIFORD. The trustee, if a good one, might be continued from year
                                to year. The people wanted the liberty of turning out unfaithful and
                                incompetent trustees.
                            Mr. SPENCER replied.
                            Mr. GLAZEBROOK thought one year's term was sufficient for a township
                                trustee. If he is worthy, the people will gladly re-elect him.
                            
                            The first amendment of the Committee, striking out the increase of
                                the trustees' term, was agreed to--affirmative 37, negative 32.
                            The second amendment, striking out "$2 50"; and inserting "$2 00,"
                                [per diem,] being read-
                            Mr. BUSKIRK said he could get $2 00 for sawing wood.
                            
                            The amendment was rejected-affirmative 32, negative 39.
                            Mr. SABIN proposed to allow Trustees six cents mileage to and from
                                the county seat.
                            Which was rejected.
                            The bill was then ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Woods's Calumet Canal bill. No. 55. coming up, it was read the
                                second time an ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Coffroth's bill, No. 57, to amend section 784 of the practice
                                act(limitation for damages,) coming up--it was read again and
                                ordered to engrossment.
                            Mr. Higgins's interest bill, No. 58, coming up with a favorable
                                committee recommendation, it was ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Newcomb's Railroad bill, No. 59, coming up, with a recommendation
                                of amendments, clearing the State from liability, and seeming the
                                protection of hydraulic power.
                            Mr. LOCKHART said there was a minority report, and, because there was
                                no rule under which it could be entertained, he moved that the bill
                                and proposed amendment be recommitted.
                            It was so ordered by consent.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK referred to the rule 59 governing the case.
                            Mr. TRUSLER (by consent) presented the petition of G. W. Shepherd and
                                others, for protection for the canal hydraulic power:
                            Which was read and referred to the Committee on
                                    Railroads. 
                            Mr. THACHER'S shade trees bill, No. 62 coming up with a favorable
                                committee recommendation, it was read the second time.
                             Mr. CHURCH proposed to amend by inserting after "cities," the words
                                "and incorporated towns:" which was adopted:
                            And so the bill was ordered to the engrossment.
                            Mr. GREGORY of Warren's soldier's county monument bill (No. 68)
                                coming up, it was read the second time and ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. Grove's railroad branch bill, No. 75, coming up, it was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed. 
                        


                        
                            THE BRIGHT LANDS.
                            Mr. Johnson's Jasper and Newton land No. 78, coming up, it was again
                                read by Clerk.
                            Mr. DUNHAM was opposed to the for the right of pre-emption till the
                                day of sale.  Its effect was to
                                sell that land-- all that is good for anything--for $1 50 an
                                acre.
                            Mr. JOHNSON explained the provisions of the bill. There were some
                                three or four thousand acres of this land, derived from Michael G.
                                Bright, as security for Col. May. The object of the pre-emption
                                clause was to secure the rightful advantage of actual settlers over
                                mere speculators. Better for the State that settlers be encouraged.
                                It was simple justice to the settlers. The land, some of it, might
                                be worth more than $1 50 an acre; much of it was
                                water--worthless.
                             Mr DUNHAM. This land was taken at a valuation-he thought much higher
                                than $1 50 an acre.
                             Mr. BRANHAM would not interfere with this bill, if he thought it
                                legal. It was swamp land. Then the State ought to make the best of
                                it. For that vast swamp land interest had been "swamped" by
                                unfaithful public officers-a much deeper loss by public
                                demoralization, than could be compensated by the value of the land
                                itself.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. If the State make another injurious compromize, it will
                                be loser to too large a portion of this fund, which was quite a
                                large fund at the first. He would have a valuation before the sale
                                of the land. He moved to lay the bill on the table--but withdrew the
                                motion for--
                            Mr. JOHNSON. He moved that it be referred to the Committee
                                    on Rights and Privileges.
                            It was so referred.
                            Mr. Stringer's Supervisors' bill, No. 79 coming up, with the Roads
                                Committee's amendment, striking out the emergency clause The
                                amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. Meredith's high-school bill, No. 82, coming up-it was ordered to
                                be engrossed.
                            Mr. Woods' Little and Grand Calumet canal bill, No. 86, coming up it
                                was read the second time.
                            Mr. WOODS proposed to amend by adding:
                            Sec.- . It being necessary that this work should
                                be commenced and completed as soon as possible, it is therefore
                                declared that an emergency exists for the immediate taking effect of
                                this act, &c.
                            The amendment was adopted, and so the bill was ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. Hershey's bill, No. 88, authorizing change of name by
                                high-schools, &c., coming up-it was read the second time and
                                ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Groves' city railroad bill, No. 89, coming up-it was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Cook's tobacco warehouse bill, No. 106, coming up-it was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed.
                            Mr. Church's consolidated railroad bill, No. 107, coming up-it was
                                read the second time.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. This being a very important bill, he moved that it be
                                laid on the table, and that 200 copies be printed.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved that it be referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary and printed.
                             Mr. DUNHAM acquiesced, and the latter motion was agreed to.
                            Mr. Cook's Tobacco Inspection bill, No. 122, coming up, it was read
                                the second time, and ordered to be engrossed.
                            The Claims Committee's Northern Prison
                                Appropriation bill, No. 133, coming up, it was read the second time.
                                [It appropriates $64,105 91]
                            Mr. BOYD said there was an amendment by the gentleman from Jackson.
                                The interest was blank.
                            The SPEAKER. There was no amendment in the files of the clerk.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. What is the amount. Is the appropriation in the gross,
                                or in detail?
                            Mr. BOYD. The amount was $64,105 91-the entire debt to that prison up
                                to March 1,1863.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. The items were in the books of the Board of Control. He
                                proposed that the further considertion of the bill be passed
                                over.
                            The House acquiesced, and the bill was passed over.
                            Mr. SHUEY'S liquor bill [H. R.129,] coming up, was read the second
                                time by the Clerk.
                            Mr. DUNHAM moved that it be referred to the Committee on
                                    Rights and Privileges.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK preferred that it be passed over till it can come from
                                the printer.
                            Mr. DUNHAM acquiesced.
                            So it was passed over informally.
                            Mr. BRANHAM (by unanimous consent,) introduced a bill [H. R. 153.]
                                for an act ratifying the action of the Governor in procuring an
                                advance of $250,000 from the President of the United States for the
                                preparation of troops for the service of the United States and for
                                the defense of the State; directing the Governor to pay the
                                unexpended balance thereof into the Treasury of the State, and to
                                account for the amount thereof expended to the President of the
                                United States as money advanced to the State:
                            Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                    Committee on the Judiciary.
                            And then--
                            On motion by Mr. BURNES-at 5 o'clock P. M.--the House adjourned till
                                to-morrow morning at nine o'clock.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE. 
                    
                        THURSDAY, February 9, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. At the adjournment, last evening, the business
                        before the Senate was the consideration of the joint resolution proposing to
                        ratify the Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, recently
                        submitted by Congress to the Legislatures of the several States for their
                        concurrence. The question is on the passage of the joint resolution.
                    Mr. DOWNEY. Mr. President: I wish to state, briefly, the reasons for the vote
                        which I shall give on the question now before the Senate. I do not desire,
                        or intend to make a speech.
                    The subject may be considered, 1st, with reference to the power so to amend
                        the Constitution of the United States; 2d, The justice of the measure, and
                        3d, The expediency of it.
                    The Constitution of the United States is the evidence of the compact entered
                        into by the original States, and agreed to by all the States which have
                        since been admitted into the Union, It
                        provides for its own amendment, and points out the manner in which it may be
                        done. This provision for amendments was in the Constitution when it was
                        entered into and agreed to by the States.
                    I know that there are persons of great ability, occupying prominent positions
                        in the country, who deny the right to amend that instrument in this respect,
                        claiming that there are implied limitations on the exercise of the power.
                        They tell us, though it may be amended in other respects, that in this it
                        cannot be amended. Can it be that there is anything in the nature of our
                        institutions which is so incompatible with freedom that an amendment of the
                        fundamental law, in accordance with its own express terms, the design of
                        which is to extend and perpetuate freedom, cannot be made? I can see no
                        sufficient reason for coming to such a conclusion. My best opinion is that
                        the power exists to amend the Constitution in this respect.
                    The considerations, then, which remain to be weighed are those of justice and
                        expediency.
                    With reference to the justice of the matter I have no doubt. I hold that
                        there are certain rights which all men possess, and of which they can not
                        rightfully be deprived, so long as they do not, by their own acts, forfeit
                        the same. I recognize the right of each person to personal security,
                        personal liberty, and to possess and enjoy property. These are spoken of as
                        the absolute rights of individuals. In our Declaration of Independence they
                        are denominated "inalienable rights," and are said to consist in "life,
                        liberty and the pursuit of happiness," They belong to man in a state of
                        nature, without reference to society. For the origin of them we do not look
                        to any Charter or Constitution. They are the gifts of God. Government may
                        and should protect these rights, but it does not confer them.
                    Yet, important as these rights are, they may be forfeited by the crimes of
                        those who possess them. Amercements, imprisonments, and even deprivation of
                        life may be necessary to promote the ends of good government; and for this
                        purpose slavery and involuntary servitude may, according to the amendment
                        proposed, still continue to exist. But unless these rights are thus
                        forfeited by the individual, human government cannot deprive him of them,
                        without, to that extent, being chargable with injustice and oppression.
                    I distinguish between these rights of which I have been speaking and those
                        which are merely relative, and which have their origin in the regulations of
                        human society. As these originate in society, so they must be controlled by
                        it. A failure to distinguish between these rights and those of which I have
                        already spoken, gives rise to much confusion of ideas, and a great amount of
                        fanaticism. Some cannot, or will not, distinguish between the right to live,
                        to be free and to enjoy the fruits of one's labor, and the right to vote, to
                        sit on a jury or to hold an office. Yet it will be seen by any one that the
                        former are the natural rights of the individual, while the latter are wholly
                        dependent upon the regulations of society. It does not follow that if you
                        recognize and secure to the colored man his natural rights, that you must
                        confer upon him all those relative rights which you have conferred upon the
                        white man, and make him his equal.
                    Slavery, as it has existed in some States of the Union, is destructive of two
                        at least of the absolute rights of the individual; these are personal
                        liberty and the right of property; for though from motives of interest the
                        master may preserve the life of the slave, he deprives him of his liberty,
                        and of the results of his labor, To be consistent, then, with what I have
                        already said, and viewing slavery with reference to the justice of it, I
                        must come to the conclusion that it ought to be extirpated.
                    With reference to the expediency of this amendment I will say this: If I
                        could believe that its adoption would be in the way of an honorable
                        adjustment of the pending national troubles, with a restoration of the union
                        of all the States under the Constitution as it is, I might hesitate to vote
                        for it, notwithstanding the power to make it might exist, and justice might
                        require it. My desire to terminate the struggle, and to save the further
                        effusion of blood and accumulation of indebtedness, might induce me to vote
                        against it, and trust to reason and to Providence to remove this great evil
                        from our land.
                    But when I remember that from the commencement of the rebellion, the avowed
                        object of the rebels has been to sever the Union; when recent developments
                        have shown that this determination still exists; and when they have refused
                        from the commencement, and still refuse to submit to the rightful authority
                        of the Government, I cannot conclude that any reasons growing out of
                        expediency require me to withhold my support from this measure.
                    Any doubts which may arise as to the constitutionality or efficiency of the
                        proclamation of the President of the United States, except as a military
                        order, will be obviated by this amendment.
                    The President has declared that his proclamation will not be modified or
                        withdrawn. If it be executed, there will be nothing of slavery left, which,
                        to those who are interested in it, will be worth preserving. I think this,
                        in every respect, the preferable mode of disposing of that which, in any
                        event, seems doomed to destruction.
                    I have never, knowingly, given a vote or used any influence which I may have
                        had for the extension of slavery. I have never believed that the
                        Constitution of the United States carried slavery into any State or
                        Territory, but have regarded it only as tolerating it, where it existed by
                        force of local usage, or enactment.
                    New questions arise now almost every and we are all liable to err in our
                        action them. When I was elected to this body the Emancipation Proclamation
                        of January 1863 had not been issued. The extirpation of slavery by an
                        amendment of the Constitution had not been discussed. My opinion is that by
                        voting for this amendment I shall reflect the will of a majority of my
                        constituents. By voting for it I shall have the satisfaction of believing
                        that my vote has been controlled by considerations of humanity and
                        justice.
                    
                     "Do what it right," is a good rule of action. An all-wise Providence will
                        take care of the consequences.
                     Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to postpone further consideration of this subject
                        till Wednesday next at 2 o'clock, P. M.
                    
                    On motion of Mr. BENNETT the motion to postpone was laid on the table by yeas
                        24, nays 20.
                    Mr. McCLURG insisted that when questions of this importance arise, and
                        Senators request time to prepare their minds that they may present their
                        constituents, in a respectable way,reasons for their vote, it is but an act
                        of courtesy that it should be extended. He did not wish to shirk
                        responsibility, but was willing to meet the question fairly and squarely in
                        the face. It was thought by prominent members of the Senate that the
                        question would not have been brought up till the press of business had been
                        disposed of, but now that it had been sprung unexpectedly, he moved to
                        postpone the further consideration of it, not until next week, until
                        to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                    Mr. BENNETT could see no good reason for postponing this question now. We had
                        voted upon motions to postpone all yesterday afternoon and could not agree
                        upon a time, and now we would gain time by going on with the discussion.
                        Besides, in his opinion, there was a sufficient number of Senators prepared
                        to speak on this subject to keep the question before the Senate till the
                        time proposed by the gentleman from Clinton [Mr. McClurg.]
                    Mr. COBB contended that it would be an act of injustice to the minority here
                        if they were pushed to a vote on this question before some time next week.
                        Mature deliberation will give greater weight to the conclusions arrived at.
                        As an act of courtesy to the minority the majority should agree to the
                        postponement. In the Senate of the United States, when any member expresses
                        a desire to be heard upon any particular question, that body invariably
                        passes over the subject in order that the Senator may have time to prepare
                        himself.
                    Mr. CASON would go to any reasonable length to extend a courtesy to the other
                        side of the House, but was convinced, aid he thought a few moments
                        reflection would convince every person, that the course being pursued by the
                        majority was a correct one. It is well known that the Senator from Rush and
                        the Senator from Ohio want leave of absence for next week, and yet gentlemen
                        in the minority are asking us to postpone this matter till the very time the
                        gentlemen named will be absent, and when it is also known that both these
                        gentlemen will vote on our side.
                    Mr. COBB (interposing.) Any time next week or week after, that gentlemen will
                        suggest would be consented to by the minority. If the Senator's friends are
                        out at any time when the vote may be taken, he will find me voting with him
                        to put off the ballot until his friends shall be present. I want a fair
                        expression from every member.
                    Mr. CASON. The majority do not feel that they would be discharging their duty
                        were they to permit this important question to lie still until week after
                        next; for one he would rather sacrifice his seat in the Senate than todo so.
                        We feel that it would be doing a wrong not only to persons in slavery but to
                        our own self-respect, patriotism and magnanimity. Shall the State of Indiana
                        lag, hesitate and be placed in the attitude before the world that she does
                        not know how to act upon this important question ?
                    Mr. McCLURG withdrew his motion.
                    Mr. BENNETT discussed the question at length. He said be should discuss the
                        question with no party feelings. All political parties had at times
                        advocated anti-slavery principles. He stated the purposes of the resolution,
                        and contended that there could be no question of the constitutionality of
                        the measure proposed, as the Constitution itself provides for the course
                        pursued in express terms. The only question was one of expediency. He
                        contrasted the systems of freedom and slavery, and said they began their
                        race in this continent at the same time. Slavery took for it course the line
                        of the sunny South. He pronounced a eulogy on the soil, clime, and natural
                        advantages of the South, but said slavery had scattered all over the
                        beautiful country ignorance, poverty, crime, libertinism, amalgamation,
                        treason, and death. That it had left as the evidences of its civilization,
                        the slave whip, human scars, and human groans, bloody battlefields,
                        blackened desolation, and utter despair. Freedom took for its course the
                        frozen North, the icy lakes and snowy mountains. That it had scattered all
                        over its track, learning, science, Christianity, and the highest order of
                        nobility--that founded on free labor. That it had left as the evidences of
                        its civilization churches, colleges, school houses, happy homes, and a free
                        people.
                    He said slavery never had any rights save those guaranteed by the
                        Constitution; that everything else good in heaven or on earth had condemned
                        the monstrous iniquity. The good men of this and every other age bad borne
                        witness again at the "sum of all villainies." He read copious extracts from
                        the speeches and writings of prominent men of all ages, of statesmen,
                        clergymen, lawyers and philosophers, to prove the crime of slavery, and said
                        that while the Constitution implies or sanctions slavery, it was the
                        expectation and hope of its framers that emancipation would ensue, and
                        slavery soon become extinct. If they had ever dreamed that the monstrous
                        evil would not only seek to live, but to control the Republic; that
                        defeated, disappointed, thwarted, it would seek to destroy the government it
                        could not rule, it would attempt by civil war to ruin the nation, they would
                        have strangled the monster ia its infancy; and not left it as a bloody
                        inheritance to their posterity.
                    He discussed the question of the rights of property, and contended that no
                        Northern man, and no Southern loyal man, would lose a single iota of his
                        inalienable right to " life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," by the
                        adoption of this measure. The only men who would be injured, and the only
                        men for whom Northern pro-slavery men can be mourning, are the Southern
                        traitors; men who have insulted our flag, trampled our Constitution under
                        foot; the uncircumcised, unregerated, unhung and undamned scoundrels whose
                        hands are to-day  dripping with the
                        blood of our brothers and our sons. He allowed Senators, representing a
                        State that had furnished one hundred and seventy-five thousand soldiers for
                        the army of the Union, would not be anxious to protect the rights of such
                        men. They had no rights. They had not even the right to breathe the pure air
                        of heaven, for the Constitution says, the penalty of treason is death. There
                        was a time when the Constitutional guarantees of slavery were held sacred by
                        us all, not because we loved slavery, but because we loved the Constitution
                        of our fathers. But in an evil hour, without the fear of God before their
                        eyes, and instigated,by the devil, these fiends incarnate trampled that
                        Constitution under foot, made one of their own, told us they did not desire
                        our guarantees, that they could protect slavery with the sword. Now by the
                        sword let it perish, and he hoped the people would have the manhood and the
                        wisdom to make their Constitution for freemen.
                    He discussed the question of negro equality, and said he had no fears on that
                        subject. He believed the Anglo-Saxon race superior to all others; was
                        willing to see all have a fair chance in the race of life, and if the
                        foremost negro overtook and passed the hindmost white man, so be it; he was
                        willing to run the race fairly, and if the nigger beat him he would give him
                        his hat. Like all general rules, this had exceptions. He believed the man
                        who really feared negro equality was in danger of being overtaken by the
                        dreadful calamity. He also thought the negro soldier the equal of the
                        Northern traitor or the Southern rebel, and thought the historian would so
                        record them, and believed the wife and children of such a negro would be
                        prouder of such a father and husband than the wife and children of such a
                        white man would be of him.
                    He also discussed the question of what should be done with, the freed negro.
                        Said he would, if he had time, suggest many plans that he deemed expedient,
                        but would answer the question by asking what will the negro do with his
                        rebel master? He was willing to leave that question to the wisdom of a
                        benificent Creator, and the future legislation of this great country. He was
                        glad he lived in the heroic age, and amid the brave people who had the
                        courage and the patriotism to meet the question boldly and remove all
                        obstacles from the pathway to our manifest destiny, and contended that we
                        should not stop on account of blood and treasure. Our fathers did not stop
                        they could have compromised the issues of 1776, but thanked God that they
                        did not. They had more right to do so than we have, for they were weak and
                        poor, and were fighting for something they never had enjoyed, while we were
                        fighting for the blessings we have enjoyed for nearly a century, and are
                        rich and strong. He said we should not fail. The nation was not to end by
                        the present rebellion. It was not decreed that the old flag should be the
                        winding sheet of the world's best hopes. God had sent the fiat forth that
                        this nation should live forever, and neither Northern traitors or Southern
                        rebels could crush it. The living and the dead speak to us, telling us our
                        case is just and we shall not fail, and instanced many gallant deeds of our
                        army and our navy in support of the hopes of our success. God was working
                        out the future of this great country in His own peculiar and indescribable
                        way. The sentence was written God had spoken it that when this war shall
                        end, there shall not be through-out this great Republic a single slave; but
                        that every human being under the aegis of the stars and stripes shall be
                        clothed, shielded and protected by that glorious banner that flag, which
                        will then, with all its insults avenged and its majesty vindicated, float
                        over a land that will be in fact, as well as in soupr, ''The land of the
                        free and the home of the brave."
                    Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved that the House adjourn.
                    The motion was rejected.
                    Mr. CULLEN. Mr. President: The age in which we live is truly one of progress.
                        Civilization and Christianity, even amid the clash of arms and the thunder
                        of battle, lift their peerless heads above the storm and beckon Americans to
                        a higher and more glorious destiny, The Thirty-eighth Congress of the United
                        States have written in characters of living light their names immortal. In
                        obedience to the unmistakable voice of an intelligent, free constituency,
                        and in accordance with the promptings of their own better natures, our
                        servants in the National Councils have taken the incipient steps (which only
                        require to be followed up by us) " to proclaim liberty throughout all the
                        land to all the inhabitants thereof." Sir, as a citizen of Indiana, and as a
                        humble member of this body, representing to a feeble way a portion of her
                        most patriotic and loyal people, I would prove recreant to my trust, and
                        unworthy so distinguished an honor, were I not to take up this key note of
                        freedom as it comes from our National Capital and re-echo it in the ears of
                        the people of Indiana.
                     Slavery, the foulest blot upon our escutcheon and that which has caused four
                        years of unparalleled and unprecedented bloody strife, is now in process of
                        speedy and ultimate extinction. Who cannot, who does not rejoice? Sir, when
                        the people of my county, with bowed bends and moistened eyes, visit the
                        graves of Gen. Hackelman and Col. Wolfe, two as brave officers as ever met a
                        foe, or fell in battle, upon whose comely forms they used to look, and upon
                        whose lips of wisdom they were wont to hang with peculiar pride and
                        pleasure, and remember that to slavery and a slaveholders' rebellion their
                        noble lives were sacrificed, think you, sir, they will not rejoice amidst
                        their grief in the knowledge of the fact that the cause of all this is
                        removed, and that their heroes died martyrs freedom and universal liberty.
                        Shall it be said of me, as the representative of their widows and orphan
                        children upon this floor, that I refused to lend my influence to remove the
                        cause of their woes? God forbid.
                    But, Mr. President, aside from these feelings and influences, permit me to
                        urge a few reasons why Indiana, in my judgment, should hasten to ratify the
                        action of Congress in the abolition of slavery. 
                    First, then, our character as a Christian Nation demands it. Although we may
                        boast of our civilization, our progress in the arts and sciences, and love
                        to linger at the shrine of  American
                        authors and teachers in morals and ethics, there is but one standard by
                        which we as Nations and individuals can be judged that is the Bible, whose
                        every word of inspiration is declares ''that of one blood God made all
                        nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth,"and for their further
                        guidance declared, "whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even
                        so to them." There can be no christianity, Mr. President, in that system
                        which mocks at the sacred ties of marriage, separates at will of masters
                        husband and wife, parent and child, dooming them and their posterity to
                        perpetual servitude. While we have called ourselves Christians and sent
                        forth our Missionaries with the light of the Gospel in hands to enlighten
                        the dark places of earth, we had well nigh forgotten that a darkness more
                        terrible, a gloom more appalling bad settled upon portions of our own
                        beloved land while surrounding nations have truth fully aid to us: ''Pluck
                        out the beam that is in thine own eye, that thou mayest see more clearly to
                        take out the mote that is in thy brother's." --Shall Christian America stand
                        alone enfolding this curse to her bosom, while all the leading powers of
                        earth have abolished it? Are we less Christian than England, France, Russia,
                        Holland? It now remains for us to answer this question.
                    But, Mr. President, there are other reasons which should impel us to act, and
                        to act promptly in this matter.
                    The system of slavery has been the disturbing element in our society, the
                        Pandora box from whence all our troubles have flown since the wheels since
                        the wheels of government were set in motion, Aye, sir, it had well nigh
                        prevented its formation; and nothing but humiliation and compromise on the
                        part of our fathers with this iniquity would suffice to give birth to our
                        nationality; and since that time, all the convulsions of our country are
                        clearly traceable to it as their chief source and fountain. In 1820-21, upon
                        the admission of Missouri, this question shook the continent as with a
                        terrible earthquake, from centre to circumference, and nothing but, a bowing
                        to the behests of slaveholders in the further spread of this blighting
                        curse, saved the nation from internal strife and civil war. In 1832, under
                        the pretext of the tariff question, but in reality to protect the labor of
                        slaves, South Carolina, under the leadership of Calhoun, threatened
                        secession and intestine war. In 1850, upon the admission of California, our
                        Government rocked to and fro like a cradle, and the wisest of our statesmen
                        could see nothing but dissolution and grim visaged war, in all directions;
                        when, from his retirement, the Sage of Ashland stepped forward, and with his
                        mighty voice spoke peace to the troubled waters. " From 1854 to 1856, the
                        virgin soil of Kansas was watered freely with the blood of its own citizens
                        in a contest between slavery and freedom. In 1860, and from that time to
                        this, war bloody, desolating, destructive war, with all its sacrifices of
                        life, health and treasure, slavery has ushered and kept upon us.
                    Slavery has indeed, Mr. President, clad our nation in the habiliaments of
                        mourning. Scarcely a hearthstone, from the princely mansion in the city to
                        the humblest cabin in the forest, but from which some loved form is missing.
                        It has dotted our land with new made graves; drawn sighs from hearts unused
                        to mourn, and tears from eyes unused to weep. Sir, while we behold these
                        pictures of sadness, shall we as Indiana Senators, proud of the heroic deeds
                        of our soldiery, refuse to concur in removing the blighting, withering
                        curse?
                    Shall we refuse to profit by the plain lessons of the past? Or shall we again
                        compromise with it, by healing over the surface, that it may break forth in
                        the future upon our children with even more terrible fury than it has upon
                        us? For let me say, that slavery fosters and builds up an aristocracy which
                        is inimical to every principle of republican government, and when it has
                        grown sufficient in power, it will never fail to grapple with it for
                        supremacy. This, it seems to me, is the plain teaching of history and
                        philosophy, which cannot have escaped the observation of Senators.
                    Another reason, Mr. President, why we should act in this matter is, that the
                        people of Indiana, (whose servants we are,) have spoken in unmistakable
                        terms at the late election upon this subject, and he who refuses to act in
                        accordance with their desire, deserves to be beaten with many political
                        stripes. In the election of Mr. Lincoln on the 8th day of November last, by
                        an unprecedented majority and with almost perfect unanimity, they ratified
                        his official acts, the chief and most glorious of which was the famous
                        Emancipation Proclamation. This is a record, which in the language of one of
                        Indiana's noblest sons, "will confirm the doubtful, fix the wavering, and
                        cheer the patriot on to duty."
                    Mr. President, slavery has not only proven a moral and political Incubus, but
                        has greatly retarded our educational progress as a nation. One of the vital
                        principles, and that which is truly the American's boast, is the general
                        equality of condition as to educational facilities. I speak now of the
                        education of the masses. And while I would not institute comparisons between
                        two sections of our country in a boasting or unkind spirit, nor yet with a
                        view to underrate the natural intellect of the South, I may be permitted to
                        advert to a few facts which history develops, to show the superiority in
                        matter of culture of the one over the other. In the free States there were
                        248,725 native adults that could neither read nor write, while in the slave
                        States there were 493 026. In the free States there were in 1852, 62,433
                        public schools, while in the slave States there were but 18,507. In the free
                        States there is not an inhabited township but that boasts of its comfortable
                        school houses, while in the South there are whole counties devoid of these
                        essential nurseries of wisdom and true manhood. In a recent letter from one
                        of our army correspondents who accompanied Gen. Sherman in his march through
                        Georgia, (as enlightened a State perhaps as any that has cherished the
                        institution of slavery,) he remarks that he met with scores of men, women
                        and children who could not tell even in what county they resided.
                    Why this great disparity? Is it because the North is the oldest settled
                        portion of the country? No; the reverse is true. Is it be-  [be]cause we are their natural superiors is
                        intellect? No; the reason is not found here. It is found Mr. President, in
                        the fact that the institution of slavery builds up and educates the few upon
                        the labor of the poorer classes.
                    The same state of facts we find to exist, and the same causes operating to
                        produce them, in the material improvements of the respective sections. But I
                        shall not now stop to enumerate statistical facts with which all are
                        acquainted upon this branch of the subject.
                    Permit me, in conclusion, Mr. President, to say, that whether or not Indiana
                        shall stand alone among her sisters in refusing her concurrence in this act,
                        slavery is a doomed institution. It is virtually dead, and all that remains
                        to be done is a decent burial. This war, and the progress of our arms, which
                        is has invoked, has proven fatal to its existence, and as well might we
                        stand at the foot of Niagara's cataract and attempt to throw back its
                        leaping waters with our hands, as to attempt to impede the onward rushing
                        current of freedom.
                    And then came the recess for dinner. 
                



                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        THURSDAY, February 9, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER then resumed the chair at 9 o'clock, A. M., and directed the
                        Clerk to call the roll, When the Clerk reported a quorum.
                    On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with.
                    Mr. TRUSLER presented the memorial of sundry citizens of the county of
                        Fayette, residing along the line of the White River Canal, with reference to
                        the public advantage of the sale of the canal right of way, and the
                        construction of a railroad in its place.
                    Which was read and referred to the Committee on
                        Railroads.
                    Similar memorials were presented by Mr. JAMES, Mr. SIM, Mr. WRIGHT, Mr.
                        STEWART, Mr. STINGER, Mr. FOULKE, Mr. WILLIS, Mr. HOGATE, Mr. KILGORE, Mr.
                        CHAMBERS, Mr. BROWN, Mr. FERRIS, and Mr. PERIGO, from citizens of their
                        several counties, and they were severally referred to the Committee
                            on Railroads.
                    Mr. HARGROVE presented the memorial of sundry citizens of Gibson county, with
                        reference to constitutional amendments acknowledging God, and the supreme
                        authority of the Lord Jesus Christ.
                    Mr. MILROY presented the memorial of sundry citizens of Carroll county, in
                        the same matter.
                    They were referred to the Special Committee on Constitutional
                            Amendments.
                    Mr. WOODS presented a memorial for claims, which (without reading) was
                        referred to the Committee on Claims.
                    Mr. WHITESIDE presented memorials for claims, which were referred (without
                        reading) to the Committee on Claims.


                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, returned Mr. Humphreys's school bill, No. 152,
                            reporting that the Committee's new bill will embody its provisions, and
                            therefore recommending that it be laid on the table.
                        Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,
                            returned Mr. Burnes's Judges' Salary bill, No. 97, reporting the opinion
                            that legislation thereon is inexpedient, and recommending that the bill
                            be laid on the table. 
                    
                    
                         COUNTY BONDS.
                        Mr. CHURCH, from a majority of the Special Committee on the
                                County Bonds bill, S. No.
                                23, returned said bill to the House, recommending the adoption
                            of the amendment reported by the Committee on the
                                Judiciary-heretofore printed in these Reports-and so
                            amended, recommending the passage of the bill.
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren, from the minority of said special committee,
                            reported that said minority are not in favor of the proposed amendments,
                            for the reason among other things that their operation would be unequal
                            in this: persons living in the townships, exempt from the provisions of
                            the bill with the amendments, who have never paid anything for the
                            raising of troops or the support of war families, would be exempt from
                            the payment of taxes proposed by the bill and amendments. Again, in
                            townships that were exempt from the last and present call for troops, on
                            account of veteran soldiers and non-resident recruits inadvertently or
                            otherwise having their names placed as credits to said townships will be
                            exempt during the present war from a draft without the payment of one
                            cent of taxation.
                        The said minority are in favor of a bill legalizing the acts of Boards of
                            County Commissioners and other authorities, provided the same can be
                            made as nearly equal and just as may be. They recommend the following
                            amendment to the bill-
                        Amend section 2, as follows:
                        "Provided, That townships which have not keen subject
                            to the draft or call for troops, at the present and last preceding call,
                            shall not be exempt from the payment of any tax to carry out the
                            provisions of this bill."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned Mr. Vey's Insurance bill, No. 117, recommending its passage,
                            without amendment.
                        He also returned the bill to save defective acknowledgments of deeds,
                            &c., recommending its passage.
                    


                    
                        RAILROAD APPRAISEMENTS.
                        Mr. CHURCH submitted the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Ways and Means instructed to inquire what
                                        legislation (if any) is necessary in order to a just
                                        appraisement for taxation of railroad property, and
                                        especially the property of those now being constructed, and
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                        Mr. BROWN moved an order for an afternoon session, which was agreed to;
                            and it was so ordered.
                    


                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED. 
                        Mr. OLLEMAN introduced a bill [H. R. 154] for an act to amend the 7th
                            section of the act providing for the election of clerks of the Circuit
                            Courts, &c., approved June 7, 1852: [Fines and Fees]:
                         Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Education.
                         Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, introduced a bill [H. R 155] for an act
                            apportioning to 
                             State into districts for Senators
                            and Representatives in the General Assembly.
                         Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                         Mr Speaker PETTIT (Mr. Newcomb in the chair ) introduced & bill [H.
                            R. 156] for an act imposing on the Clerks of the Several Circuit Courts
                            the duty of preparing applications for back pay, for back pay and
                            bounties, balance of bounties, half pay and pensions, creating a State
                            agent for soldiers' claims to represent the same; imposing on certain
                            officers the duty of preparing and certifying documentary evidence in
                            connection with such memorials, prescribing the duties of such officers,
                            and imposing penalties for violating their duties.
                         He moved that it be referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs. Before the motion was put, he begged to intimate
                            that this bill has been prepared by gentlemen who have been intimately
                            connected with this interest, and who have thought that the compensation
                            of one dollar would be adequate to provide for all applications for back
                            pay, back pay and bounties, and for pensions. Considering the large
                            number of these claimants, it has been deemed not improper to create a
                            State agent, who shall take charge of them. The object was to stop the
                            manifold abuses in the claims business, and to fix a uniform rate of
                            compensation.
                        Mr. McVEY introduced a joint resolution [H. R. No. 15] asking that our
                            soldiers in rebel prisons may be speedily exchanged ; which was passed
                            to the second reading, and referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE submitted a resolution, which was adopted, directing the
                                Committee on County and Township Business, to
                            inquire into the expediency of amending section 16 of the act of 1859
                            for the election of Supervisors.
                        Mr. TEACHER introduced a bill [H. R. 151] for an act to amend section 21
                            of the act regulating descents and apportionment of estates, approved
                            May 14, 1852:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. TRUSLER (the regular order being suspended) moved to take up his
                            Military bill, No. 94, for reference. 
                        The motion was agreed to, and accordingly the bill was taken up and
                            referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.
                    

                    
                        CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.

                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, the House was resolved into Committee of
                                the Whole House--Mr. Henricks in the Chair--and took up
                            the special order for this hour, viz: the consideration of the following
                            joint resolution [No. 13,] submitted last week by Mr. Whiteside:
                        Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of
                                Indiana, that this General Assembly does hereby fully accept
                            and ratify the following article in addition to and amendment of the
                            Constitution of the United States, proposed by the Congress thereof,
                            to-wit:
                        
                            "ARTICLE XIII.
                        
                        "SECTION 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a
                            punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,
                            shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their
                            jurisdiction.
                        "SEC. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by appropriate
                            legislation,"
                        And the Governor's Message in relation to the same matter.
                        The CHAIRMAN directed the reading of the message and joint
                            resolutions.
                        They were read by the Clerk.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the magnitude and importance of
                            the question before the Committee, and I approach the discussion with
                            great distrust of my ability to pro-sent it fully and fairly to the
                            House. But I feel constrained by a sense of duty to resist the
                            ratification of the joint resolutions of the Congress of the United
                            States for the prohibition of slavery in the several States of the
                            Union; and it is due to myself and the people I represent, that I should
                            briefly give the reasons that control my action. I do not expect, sir,
                            nor do any on our side of the House expect, or think for a moment, that
                            by anything we can say here the result will be changed. So far as the
                            action of the House is concerned, we regard that as fixed and certain.
                            The joint resolution of the gentleman from Wabash will be passed in the
                            House, and it in equally certain that it will pass the Senate, and this
                            action of Congress will be ratified by the authority of the Legislature
                            now assembled. But this is no reason why those of us who are opposed to
                            it should not give our voices upon the matter.
                        There is another reason why it is more important that those representing
                            the minority here should give their views, than that the majority should
                            be heard in their views. The majority here are voting and acting with
                            the current of public opinion. The minority stand in opposition to that
                            current. We have to face the storm. We have to meet the zealous scorn
                            and indignation of a portion of the people. Therefore, we should have
                            opportunity to be heard; and I have no doubt that the House will give
                            it. 
                        Before I proceed to give the reasons that will control my vote, I desire
                            to say that I do not to-day speak in the interest of slavery. I have
                            neither interest in, nor sympathy with slavery. That is not my ground of
                            objection to the resolution. If the people where slavery exists think
                            proper to abolish slavery, it will meet with my hearty approval, and I
                            shall be, thankful for it. Nor do I intend to ba drawn into a line of
                            argument that can be construed into a defense or justification of the
                            institution of slavery. I am opposed to the ratification of the
                            amendment proposed in the joint resolution, on three grounds:
                        First. The exercise of the powers claimed will result in a virtual charge
                            of our form of government.
                        Secondly, It will be an impediment, an obstruction in the way of the
                            restoration of the Union under the Federal Constitution; and--
                        Thirdly, If I vote for the amendment I shall feel constrained to follow
                            out the principle to its natural, logical and legitimate results, and
                            give to the African race the rights they will be entitled to after their
                            condition of slavery shall have been abolished, and they shall be
                            elevated to the character of citizens of the commonwealth.
                        Mr. B. spoke at length under these divisions.


                        
                        Mr. WRIGHT was one of those claiming to belong to the Democratic party.
                            He had voted with that party for thirty years, and in 1860 he voted far
                            John G. Breckinridge. He had always felt that the Government could not
                            be maintained with slavery, but would not interfere with it; and he
                            would not interfere with it now if the South had not refused obedience
                            to the Constitution. The price of protection is obedience. He denied the
                            doctrine of State sovereignty laid down by Mr. Buskirk, and sustained
                            his position by reference to the powers and attributes of sovereignty
                            delegated to the Federal Government. This doctrine was not generally
                            claimed by the Democratic party. He argued from the record of Patrick
                            Henry, that there was Constitutional power vested in the General
                            Government to abolish slavery. He also cited the authority of Alexander
                            Stephens to the same point. The gentleman had admitted that slavery was
                            dead or dying; then let its friends and apologists be its funeral
                            pallbearers. Slavery had caused this rebellion, why then should he
                            cherish it ? He contended that we should not.
                        Had it not been for negro slavery, this war would not have been begun,
                            and if begun it could not have been continued for one year.- Was this a
                            reason for its continuance? Was it not good reason for its destruction?
                            He saw all the traitors in the history of this country arising out of
                            the Democratic party, from Aaron Burr down to Breckinridge and Buchanan.
                            Traitors hid themselves in that party because it was nearly all the time
                            in the ascendant. He was especially desirous to expose the fallacy of
                            the doctrine of State Rights, and for this purpose he reviewed the
                            history of slavery in the Territories. A sectional line induced
                            sectional feeling. It was the act of the South; and they had complained
                            of their own set, and repealed it. They had at length staked this
                            interest of slavery on the issue of war, and if the hand of war wiped it
                            out he had no regrets to offer.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the Committee now rose, and the Chairman reported
                            progress. and asked and obtained leave to sit again at 2 o'clock this
                            afternoon.
                        On motion by Mr. COLLINS, the House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                    


                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        THE SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and announced the
                            special order.



                        
                            RAILROAD APPRAISEMENTS.
                            Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H.
                                R. 158] for an act to provide for the appraisement for taxation of
                                the property of railroads in in this State, prescribing the duty of
                                officers in relation thereto, and repealing all laws in
                                contravention thereof, or inconsistent therewith.
                            Which was passed the second reading, and referred to the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means.
                        


                        
                            ASSESSMENT LAWS.
                            Mr. BRANHAM (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R 159] for
                                an act to provide for the valuation and appraisement of the real
                                estate and personal property of railroad companies, and the
                                collection ot taxes in the State of Indiana; for the apportionment
                                of appraisements of real estate, the appointment of township
                                assessors, and prescribing the duties of appraisers of real estate
                                and assessors of personal property, county treasurers and auditors,
                                the treasurer and auditor of State; and assigning the fees of county
                                auditors for making tax duplicates, delinquent lists, assessors'
                                books, transferring real estate for taxation, and for making tax
                                title deads, and for the execution of certificates to purchasers of
                                land and lots sold for taxes.
                            
                            Mr. B. moved, and it was declared to be expedient, (yeas 70, nays 5,)
                                to dispense with the constitutional restriction, and that the bill
                                be reads the first time by title. [A voluminious bill--a general
                                revision of the Assessment laws ] So it was passed to the second
                                reading and referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means.
                            The bill [S. 12,] authorizing creditors to bring actions on claims
                                before they are due in certain cases, coming up,--
                            On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, it was referred to the Committee
                                    on the Judiciary.
                            The Printing Committee's Estray bill [No. 147]
                                coming up, it was read the second time and ordered to be
                                engrossed.
                            Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe's Supreme Court Bill, No. 2, coming up with
                                Judiciary Committee's amendment recommending the striking out the
                                amendment of the Committee on Fees and Salaries,
                                its passage was recommended.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB said the passage of the bill was desirable, on account of
                                the provision requiring the Supreme Court to sit during the session
                                of the Legislature; and to give opinions in writing, when requested,
                                as to the constitutionality of measures pending before the
                                Legislature.
                            Pending the question of concurrence-
                            Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the special order.
                            Whereupon-
                        


                        
                             CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.
                            
                            The House again resolved into Committee of the
                                    Whole-Mr. Henricks in the chair-and took the
                                consideration of Mr. Whiteside's joint resolution, No. 13, for
                                ratification of the proposed amendment of the Constitution of the
                                United States, and the Governor's message to relation thereto.
                            Mr. BURTON addressed the House against the joint resolution to ratify
                                the proposed Constitutional amendment. He expected the resolution
                                would be adopted. Anything he could say would not perhaps change a
                                single vote, but it was expected of Democrats here to vindicate
                                their votes. They could not vote for this proposition without making
                                an unjustifiable alliance with the federalism of the past, and the
                                fanaticism and abolitionism of the present. They could not do so
                                without ignoring State rights. He supported the doctrine of State
                                rights, and illustrated its guarantees in connection with this
                                proposition to abolish slavery. Slavery was property, and in this,
                                the resolution was a violation of the Constitutional guarantee of
                                private property. It was also a violation of the Federal compact-it
                                was ignoring good faith; and he contended that even a three-fourths
                                ratification could not bind the remaining fourth of the States, as
                                to an infraction of the rights of property. Its tendency was to
                                destroy the Federal compact. Three-fourths  could not override the rights of
                                property in the other fourth. The three-fourths adopting this
                                amendment, would be a new Union--the other fourth the old Union. 
                            It was a plain issue between the old Union and a new Union, with
                                larger central powers. He showed the disingenuousness of the
                                Administration in their first and later avowals of the objects of
                                the war. Adopt this amendment and it would fire the Southern heart;
                                it would yet further and more firmly unite the South, and it would
                                distract and divide the North. Gentlement were mistaken if they
                                supposed that the refusal of the rebels to come back under their
                                amended Constitution, would unite the North in a more vigorous
                                prosecution of the war. It was said that slavery was dead. Governor
                                Morton had said it must die. But he insisted that God had stamped
                                upon the negro a mark of inferiority that could not be removed by
                                legislation. There would be American slavery in these States so long
                                as the two races remained together--the inferior must forever
                                continue as the subjected race. He showed at length the danger of
                                assuming new powers in this government.
                             Mr. MEREDITH did not propose a set speech, but only to offer a few
                                suggestions in reply to the opposition. He adverted to national
                                discords induced by the institution of slavery culminating in civil
                                war. It was astonishing to hear men still contending for a
                                constitutional provision to perpetuate it. He exhorted the House to
                                accept the occasion for its destruction with readiness, quoting and
                                showing that the proposed amendments were provided by the
                                constitution itself. He had no apprehension from the intimation that
                                this amendment would fire the Southern heart. He had supposed that
                                fire had burned out. The fathers of the republic were all adverse to
                                the perpetuation of slavery. It was never regarded by them as a
                                fundamental principle of the Government. The people were sovereign,
                                and they may change or modify their Constitution as they please. He
                                replied to the objections urged by Mr. Burton-- When the rebellion
                                struck at the life of the Government, the declarations of Mr.
                                Lincoln and the platform of the Republican party with reference to
                                slavery, became as nothing in comparison with the patriotic duty to
                                defend and perpetuate the Government. Slavery had ever been a
                                disturbing element, and now was the time to get rid of it. It was
                                idle to compromise with slavery. It had divided even the churches,
                                and broke in pieces the Democratic party. Maryland and Missouri had
                                been taught by desertions that they could not live with slavery And
                                the time had fully come to execute the sentence of annihilation. 
                            Mr. BROWN said: Mr. Chariman-- It is with feelings of embarrassment
                                and regret that I undertake to participate in this discussion; of
                                embarrassment because I recognize the insufficiency of my own
                                endowments of power to give the subject the consideration to which
                                it is entitled; of regret, because the representatives of the people
                                of the State of Indiana are called upon to pass upon a question of
                                such gravity and importance at a time of great public excitement. I
                                shall not attempt to answer the elequent and elaborate speeches of
                                the gentelman from Jefferson (Mr. Wright) and the gentleman from
                                Vigo, (Mr. Meredith) But I shall undertake, according to my poor
                                ability, to submit to the committee what I conceive to be the duty
                                of men owing allegiance to the Government and the Constitution of
                                the United States.
                             In the first place, I undertake to say, that Congress has no power
                                conferred upon it by the Constitution to pass this amendment.
                                Congress may have the right to pass it, but it was not derived from
                                the Constitution. It is from the right of revolution. There is a
                                right of revolution--but no right of secession. The powers of
                                Congress are restricted to those conferred on that body by the
                                States and the people, and the people have not conferred the right
                                upon Congress to amend the Constitution of the United States. They
                                have not given up the right. The gentleman from Sullivan, (Mr.
                                Burton,) has well expressed it, that the people formed the Union and
                                the Constitution, so as to secure the rights they had before the
                                Constitution, and the general government cannot exercise rights
                                which the people have not delegated and given up. Let us see how
                                this Union began, and if we understand this, there will be no
                                trouble about determining what is our duty in the present hour.
                                Where does our sovereign power begin? Does it begin with the
                                Constitution? It does not. The Constitution simply secures the
                                people in the enjoyment of rights they had before the Constitution
                                was made. Our soveriegnty began with the people, not with the
                                Federal Union. The great difficulty is this: Republicans think that
                                all the sovereignty in this whole country is conferred upon one
                                great corporation, and that is the Congress of the United States;
                                and that we must beseech Congress for whatever we desires, if it may
                                so please that body to have the magnanimity to grant it. Mr.
                                Chairman, let us not give ourselves the character of usurpers. For
                                what did our fathers go to war with Great Britain? It was because we
                                would not submit to despotic power. Our fathers fought for a
                                Government that would give the largest exercise of power to the
                                people. When the people of this country absolved themselves from
                                their allegiance to the crown of Great Britain these States or
                                colonies became free and independent of that power as well as free
                                and independent of each other. New York became a nationality--Rhode
                                Island a nationality--and South Carolina and Massachusetts became
                                the same.
                            In 1787, the people of these nationalities came together to form a
                                more perfect Union, to establish justice, insure domestic
                                tranquility, and to provide for the common defense and general
                                welfare; and for these purposes, they ordered and established the
                                Constitution. What did they do then? Did the people give up their
                                inherent rights as independent sovereignties? No. But it was for the
                                purpose of establishing such a government with delegated powers as
                                might be necessary to protect them in the enjoyment of peace and
                                happiness. And when this Constitution came from the hands of the
                                convention that formed it, it was still the good pleasure of the
                                people of several States to adopt or reject it. Suppose after nine
                                States had adopted it, any
                                other State had refused to adopt it, does any man suppose that those
                                nine States would have had the right to compel that other State to
                                adopt it? Certainly not; for it will be remembered that it is
                                expressly asserted in the Constitution, that all rights not therein
                                expressly delegated, are reserved to the States and to the people. I
                                will ask any gentleman on this floor, to point me to any record of
                                that Constitutional Convention that can indicate the intention to
                                confer upon Congress the power to legislate with reference to the
                                institution of slavery. Nay, was not that power distinctly denied? I
                                affirm it here, that Congress was distinctly denied the power to
                                regulate the status of citizens of the different States?
                            There is but one exception inside the Constitution, and that is in
                                the case of naturalization. Instead of Congress possessing all the
                                rights and powers which the Constitution does not confer, it does
                                not possess one single power which is not expressly conferred in
                                that instrument. These are all reserved rights of the States. The
                                States are older than the Constitution, and their authority higher
                                than the Constitution. Let me ask: Would it be right for Congress to
                                fasten slavery on the people of the State of Indiana? Why has not
                                Congress the right to do this? The Constitution does not say it has
                                not. Has not Congress the right to so amend the Constitution that a
                                monarchy may be established? The Constitution does not forbid it.
                                But I ask you, sir, has not Congress authority to establish slavery
                                throughout this country? Why has it not? The answer is, because
                                Congress cannot exercise those reserved powers which the people have
                                reserved to themselves. Then, if. Congress can't establish slavery,
                                in God's name show me its authority for abolishing slavery. Thank
                                God, Indiana has not been cursed by it, and she shall not be by my
                                vote. But this is no reason that the people of no other State shall
                                take upon themselves the blight and the benefit of slavery. The
                                doctrine of non-intervention is right; and gentlemen sitting here on
                                the other side, have nearly all of them endorsed it, at some time or
                                other. Why did they admire Henry Clay? It was because he stood
                                firmly upon the fundamental principles of the Constitution-because
                                he stood by the rights of the States and the General Government, and
                                distinguished between them.
                            There is another reason why Congress does not possess the power, and
                                that is in the fact that slaves are property in the States where the
                                State laws make them property. And the Constitution of the United
                                States has recognized them as property. Hardly any nation, any
                                Government, can pass laws impairing the property right of the
                                people.
                            Mr. B. spoke at length and when he had concluded,
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, took the floor. He referred to the fling
                                of Mr. Brown against Mr. Wright, alleging that the place of a
                                steamboat Captain was more befitting that gentleman than a seat in
                                this hall. He retorted, that the gentleman from Jackson would as
                                well grace the block of the slave auctioneer. He showed the mistake
                                of the gentleman from Jackson in treating the proposition as though
                                Congress by itself was proposing to amend the Constitution. It was
                                an amendment proposed by Congress for the ratification of the
                                States. The gentlemen made another mistake in regard to the manner
                                and time of the adoption of the existing amendments of the
                                Constitution. They were all proposed by Congress, and some of them,
                                so far from being adopted by the States with the original
                                instructions, were not proclaimed by the President as part of the
                                Constitution of the United States till 1798, and even as late as
                                1804, He defended at length the war policy of the present
                                administration. He compared particularly the success of our armies
                                during the first year of the rebellion, when the war was conducted
                                upon the principles of the opposition, with the success of our
                                armies for the past two years, which had broken the rebellion, and
                                it was now tottering to its fall. He admitted that it was the
                                mission of the Republican party to destroy slavery, as far as they
                                could do so legitimately. The reason the war was not ended, he found
                                in the factious divisions and impediments inaugurated by the.
                                Democratic opposition. No treasonous conspiracy against the
                                Government was to be found in the Republican party. But wherever we
                                find sympathizers with the rebellion, they were acting with the
                                Democratic party. And he raw the reason for this in the fact that
                                nearly all the prominent Southern rebels were originally members of
                                the Democratic party. He responded to the question of Mr. Brown,
                                drawn from the preamble to the Constitution of the United States,
                                whether the abolition of slavery would establish justice, &c.
                                With reference to the evil consequences resulting from the changed
                                social position of the black race, be insisted that the consequences
                                will be more tolerable than what, he had himself two years ago
                                observed in the South.
                            He closed by glancing at the question of responsibility for the war,
                                and saw again, that all the leaders of the rebellion were Democrats.
                                What did gentlemen mean when they claimed that this amendment would
                                put 200,000 men into the Southern armies? as alleged by the
                                gentleman from Monroe. Would they go themselves into those armies?
                                This war would end when the gentleman's Democratic friends in the
                                South shall lay down their arms and submit themselves to the
                                Constitution and laws.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the Committee rise, report progress, and ask
                                leave to sit again to-morrow at, 2 o'clock.
                            Mr. DUNHAM proposed to-morrow at 10 o'clock.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK accepted.
                            Mr. SHUEY and Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, indicated a desire for an
                                evening session.
                            Mr. BRANHAM proposed to postpone the matter till nest week.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, did not want to stop this debate till we
                                should get through.
                            Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe proposed to amend the motion by making it
                                simply a motion that the committee rise-with the object that a night
                                session might be ordered by the House.
                            
                            The amendment to the motion was rejected-affirmative 27, negative not
                                counted.

                            
                            Mr. KILGORE proposed Tuesday, 10 o'clock, but did not insist on
                                it.
                            Mr. Buskirk's motion was then agreed to;and accordingly--the
                                committee rose, and--
                            The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and the recommendation of the
                                committee for leave to sit again to-morrow morning at 10
                                o'clock.
                            The report was concurred in--
                            And then, at 5:25 P. M.--the House adjourned till to-morrow morning
                                nine o'clock.
                        
                    
                


                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        Thursday, February 9, 1865.
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        

                         The following bills were introduced, read the first time, and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        By Mr. WRIGHT, [S. 150 ] to amend
                            sections 7, 9 and 20 of an act to provide against the consequences
                            ensuing or likely to ensue from the destruction of books, pamphlets,
                            paper records or other writings of any county, &c., approved January
                            12, 1852. 
                         By Mr. COBB, [S. 151,] authorizing the boards of trustees of
                            incorporated towns to demand and enforce a license from all keepers of
                            coffee houses, or other places where, intoxicating liquors are sold or
                            drank within, the limits of their respective jurisdictions, (the license
                            fee to be fixed by said boards.)
                        By Mr. RICHMOND, [S. 152,] to amend section 7 of an act touching the
                            laying out and vacating towns, streets, alleys, public squares and
                            grounds. &c , approved May 20, 1852.
                        By Mr. ALLISON, [S. 153 ] creating a board of control of the Indiana
                            State Prison, North and South, together with a President of the same, to
                            be elected by the present General Assembly, and defining their powers
                            and duties and appealing all laws and parts of laws coming in conflict
                            with the provisions of this bill, and declaring an emergency.

                        EXPENSES OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                        The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            hour, being the House amendments to the bill [S. 1,] appropriating $75,000 for
                            the expenses of the General Assembly.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, read the discussion of this question in the 17th
                            Indiana reports-case of the Indiana Central vs. Potts
                            -- commenting thereon as he read, to prove that this bill would be an
                            unconstitutional one if the House amendments were adopted by the Senate.
                            If, under the title given this bill in the House, viz: An act making
                            specific appropriations, we have power to pay members who bolted two
                            years ago, and pay back to corporations and individuals the money
                            borrowed by Governor Morton, we have the power, under a title of that
                            kind, to pass any appropriations, if you please, to pay the interest on
                            the State debt or to carry on the benevolent institutions of the
                            State.
                        Under the constitutional provisions which requires a constitutional
                            majority to pass a bill, a simple concurrence in these House amendments
                            would not be sufficient, for this is a new and distinct bill from the
                            one originally passed by the Senate. Therefore it must require a
                            majority of members elect to pass it, and it must have three several
                            readings upon three several days. To sustain this view he read from the
                            11th Indiana, and from decisions of our own, and the Supreme Courts of
                            the State of Ohio.
                        The object seems to be no other than that the propositions which are
                            contained in the House amendments are propositions which Senators think
                            they could not get through this Legislature in the regular way, and they
                            would fillibuster them through in this infamous kind of style.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend the House amendments as follows:
                        Strike out all that part of the amendment to the third section which
                            relates to the payment of members of the last House of Representatives,
                            who absented themselves from the halls of legislation without just cause
                            or provocation, for the time which they were so absent.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. Richmond, the amendment was laid on the table, by yeas
                            23, nays 22-the Lieutenant Governor voting in the affirmative.
                        Mr. HORD moved to amend by providing for the payment of those who may be
                            absent during the present session without leave.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. DUNNING, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 26,
                            nays 18.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend by striking cut all that part of the amendment
                            which provides for the appropriation of $135,000.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 25,
                            nays 21.
                        Mr. COBB moved to amend by striking out all that relates to the payment
                            of interest.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. CASON, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 23,
                            nays 21.
                        Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend as follows:
                        "Strike out all that part of the section appropriating money to various
                            parties for sums advanced to the government; and amend so as to
                            appropriate $135,000 for the support of benevolent institutions for the
                            years 1863 and 1864."
                        
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the amendment was laid on the table, by yeas 24,
                            nays 20.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to postpone the further consideration of this
                            matter until five weeks from to-day.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the motion to postpone was laid on the table by
                            yeas 32, nays 13.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR directed the consideration of the House
                            amendments seriatim.
                        The first amendment being read-the one appropriating the per diem
                            withheld from a portion of the members of the last House of
                            Representatives for the nine last days of that session of the General
                            Assembly-


                        
                        The Senate refused to concur in the amendment--yeas 22, nays 23, as
                            follows:

                         Pending the roll call--

                         The second amendment of the House, appropraiting $135,000 to repay the
                            principal, with interest, on loans made by Governor Morton for the

                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        FRIDAY, February 10, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    The Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings were being read, when,
                    On motion by Mr. OYLER the further reading thereof was dispensed with.

                    
                         PER DIEM TO BOLTING MEMBERS.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday afternoon refusing
                            to concur in the amendment of the House of Representatives to the bill,
                            [S 1,] making appropriation for the expenses of the present General
                            Assembly-the one appropriating the per diem withheld
                            from a portion of the members of the last House of Representatives for
                            the nine last days of that session of the General Assembly.
                         He said: I have not changed my mind in regard to that manner of doing
                            Legislation: I regard  it as an
                            improper manner, but upon reflecting that it subjects a large number of
                            employees to the inconvenience of doing without their pay; and the
                            discussion likely to arise here afterwards will cause the State the loss
                            in time of a large amount of money, I have concluded that I will yield
                            my objections and if the Senate has a mind to reconsider I will afford
                            this opportunity.
                        Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate. 
                        The call was proceeded with, and seven Senators were reported absent.
                        The Senate directed the Doorkeeper to bring in the absentees.

                            as shall compel the applicant to obtain the signatures of a majority of
                            voters in the neighborhood, city, town or township, to his petition for
                            a license, so that no license shall be granted unless a majority of the
                            voters are in favor of it. 
                        The petition was referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance.

                        Mr. DUNNING asked and obtained leave of absence for Messrs. Downey and
                            Callen during next week.

                            praying for relief to sufferers on account of the John Morgan raid. They
                            were laid on the table.

                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND, and by unanimous consent, the bill [S. 100]paying Township Assessors
                            $2 50 a day after January 1, 1865, was read the third time and finally

                         AMENDMENT OP THE CONSTITUTION OF THE U. S.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the business before the Senate to be
                            the consideration of the joint resolution [S. 16,] proposing to ratify the
                            Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, recently submitted
                            by Congress to the Legislature of the several States for their
                            concurrence, which was passed over informally yesterday afternoon; the
                            question being on the passage of the joint resolution.
                        Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President: As many of the Senators have given their
                            reasons for the vote they are about to give upon the proposition now
                            before the Senate, it will not be considered presumptuous in me if I
                            give, in part, the reasons that influence me in the vote which I will be
                            called upon to give in the disposition of the important question before
                            us.I hold, Mr. President, that there is a great principle involved in
                            the joint resolution before us. And that principle is, whether the
                            constitution of our country can be amended so as to destroy the private
                            rights of citizens accruing under State laws, and in violation of State
                            enactments. I hold that this cannot be done against the consent of any
                            one of the States belonging to the compact. It is written in the
                            constitution, that all powers not delegated to it are expressly reserved
                            to the people of the respective States. Is this a power? Has a similar
                            proceeding ever been attempted before in the history of our country? Has
                            Congress ever attempted to control or intermeddle with the local
                            institutions of the States?
                        If there are any powers belonging to the people of the States, which have
                            heretofore been well defined, and acknowledged upon the part of all, has
                            it not been the power to regulate their domestic institutions in their
                            own way? Has not the right of property, as obtained by the citizen from
                            State organizations, been held as amongst the most sacred of all rights?
                            And then the question arises, if this right can be invaded in the manner
                            proposed ? Cannot every other right that the citizen supposes he is in
                            the enjoyment of be invaded and wiped out by a similar process?
                            Legislators, then, should look well to it before they strike down a
                            great principle that lies at the very foundation of our governmental
                            organization.
                        So far as slavery is concerned in the rebel States, if it should expire
                            by the wear and tear of our armies, let it go. The contest in which we
                            are engaged is one that the South invited, and they must suffer the
                            consequences in this respect.
                        But, Mr. President, as long as the institution exists by law, in any one
                            of the States of this Union, I would not feel at liberty to vote for the
                            proposition before the Senate, unless compensation to loyal men, for
                            their property destroyed, should be coupled with it, I consider it,
                            however, a State institution, regulated and managed by them, for which
                            they are responsible, and whenever they shall, by their own act, abolish
                            it, and it shall no longer exist in any one of the States of this Union,
                            not until then would I feel at liberty, standing: where I do, to vote
                            for a proposition of the character of the one now before the Senate.
                        If it was a proposition to prohibit involuntary servitude, particularly
                            in in own State of Indiana, I would vote to prohibit it. But that is not
                            necessary, for it is written in the organic law of Indiana, that slavery
                            nor involuntary servitude shall exist only in the punishment of crimes.
                            But voting to abolish it in another State, where by State enactment all
                                the sanctity and vitality that
                            is thrown around any other species of property, is thrown around this,
                            it seems like the work of presumption on my part to vote in favor of the
                            Constitutional amendment which is now before us.
                        My position then is, that this work should be done, if done at all, by
                            those States where it exists. Let them abolish it, and provide such
                            compensation as they deem necessary to such of their citizens as may be
                            injured by it, and at the same time to provide for that class of persons
                            they liberate from servitude. There is where this work should commence,
                            and where only it could legally and constitutionally be eradicated from
                            our statute books.
                        Mr. HORD. Five years ago the most sagacious or imaginative could not have
                            foreseen this hour in the Senate of the State, when we are called upon
                            to amend the Constitution of the United States in such way as to
                            regulate the domestic institutions of a State,to remove and abolish a
                            system of slavery imposed by the constitutions and laws of the several
                            States. We have been learned, from early youth to acknowledge the
                            sovereign power of a State, its reserved and inalienable rights, and the
                            limited nature of the General Government; and when centralization is
                            encouraged at this crisis by the party in power, when it seeks to
                            provincialise the States, to emasculate and weaken them to dependencies,
                            the unusual change and revolution in our system startles and astonishes
                            the most philosophic heart.
                        A short time after the amendment introduced by the venerable Crittenden
                            for the attainment of peace, was defeated--the adoption of which would
                            have secured to us the ambrosial paradise of peace--the Congress of the
                            United States adopted a resolution to change the Constitution in such
                            way as to secure slavery to the States then holding the same, and after
                            a few years had gone down the magnificent but melancholly mausoleum of
                            ages, bearing with them the ruins of reason, the wrecks of ambition, and
                            the faded flowers of human hopes and human affections, the same Congress
                            passed the resolution making the amendment to the Constitution of the
                            United States, the ratification of which is sought in the joint
                            resolution under consideration.
                        The Southern States did, or did not have the right to hold slaves under
                            the Constitution. If they had such right, why did the Republican party
                            seek this amendment to the Constitution securing slavery to them? If
                            they had not that right, why adopt the joint resolution now under
                            discussion by the Senate? The Republican party has committed itself to
                            the construction that the Constitution does not secure slavery to the
                            States, inasmuch as the President has issued proclamations interfering
                            with slavery in the States, and Congress has made enactments impairing
                            its security. If this is the conscientious opinion of that party, the
                            amendment prepared is useless and superrogatory. If it is not their view
                            of the Constitution, then they have wilfully defied and stricken that
                            instrument, to the support of which they pledged themselves, and invoked
                            the God of nature in that pledge to witness their sincerity and fidelity
                            to its spirit.
                        The President and Congress did or did not believe that the States were
                            secured in their domestic institutions by that instrument against
                            Presidential or Congressional interference. If they believe in their
                            honest conceptions of that instrument, that the States are not secured
                            against such interposition of power, then in their own opinion the
                            amendment is a useless measure. If this was not their estimate of the
                            organic law of the nation, then there is more stain and more shameless
                            crime in the hearts of the Republican leaders than ever found a resting
                            place in the realms of Tartarus, as they have willfully torn it in
                            tatters that instrument and tramped and disgraced it.
                        Nations never die, but commit suicide, and when we see the sword drawn
                            upon our neck by rage, and held by the crazy hand of passion, why not
                            stay the maniac and drive him to his, cell until reason sways again? Now
                            is no time to make changes in the Constitution. I have never been
                            favorable to any interpolations in it, and especially at this time would
                            be destructive to the best interests of the people. If any amendment is
                            desirable wait until war has ended. Wait until passion is subdued, and
                            reason can in good nature, unshackled and unobstructed, shed its
                            radiance upon questions of such serious moment? The nation is now mad.
                            An hour of rage is not a time when justice can ha secured, and if
                            passion is unkenneled to have its way, it may, with indiscriminate hand,
                            blast and destroy much good.
                        I am opposed to any interference with the constitution at, this time.
                            Leave it as it is. It is ample for all purposes. The Constitution of the
                            United States did not establish slavery in the States; it is the State
                            law and constitution that has created the institution, and the only
                            reasonable and equitable means of securing the abolition of slavery is
                            to change the State constitutions recognizing it, and not tamper with
                            the constitution of the United States, as this is an inauspicious time.
                            Slavery is no longer a political question. It has run its race and
                            rotted; its requiem has been hummed by every bird and breeze. The march
                            of our army unshackles and frees the slaves, and slavery can never enter
                            into future political contentions. Its knell was sounded by the Southern
                            hand on the site of Charleston. Slavery ascended with the firat wreath
                            of smoke curling from the boom of artillery against Sumpter's front, and
                            with it vanished into thin air, and it is not left for any one to weep
                            over the agonies of its departure. Is it discreet and politic to adopt
                            the amendment? Its adoption may give a stimulus to Southern enthusiasm,
                            where it is our interest to discourage it. It may units and harmonize
                            the sentiments of those in arms against us where it is our policy to
                            divide and distract them. It will add recruits to the Southern army who
                            may heretofore have been passive and disinterested in the events of the
                            struggle.
                        Mr. H. urged, as an additional objection to the proposed amendment, that
                            it tends to centralize power in the hands of the General Government.
                            State sovereignty is the only security to personal liberty. He argued
                            that we had not the power to make the amendment in the manner proposed,
                            and if the latter day doctrine of the Republican party is correct that
                            the right.  of amendment is
                            unlimited, then government does provide for its own destruction. The
                            States made the Constitution, the Constitution did not make the States.
                            The Supreme Court of the United States, in numerous cases, has decided
                            that the United States are sovereign,A that their powers are only
                            limited by the Constitution.
                        There is another view of this question. The as accumulated a large debt
                            upon us, and will be heavy upon every one. Slavery represents property
                            and labor. As such property, it is liable to taxation to defray the
                            national debt. You abolish slavery, and you lease twenty hundred
                            millions of property from taxation, and thereby increase the burden of
                            taxation upon the laboring citizen of the North. Are the Northern States
                            willing to assume this onerous burden of debt and taxation for the
                            gratification of enfranchising the slaves of the South. The people of
                            the North will have enough to bear their own burden without assuming the
                            payment of the debt and taxation that should be assessed on Southern
                            States. This matter deserves our serious consideration. 
                        Mr. DUNNING desired to know if he understood the Senator to say that the
                            Constitution of the United States was framed by the States in their
                            sovereign capacity, and that the Constitution was an agreement between
                            the States as sovereignties? 
                        Mr. HORD. Yes, sir.
                        Mr. DUNNING then called the attention of the Senator to Story's
                            Commentaries, sections 152-3: "The Constitution of the United Spates is
                            not a compact or treaty between different sovereignties," &c.
                        Mr. HORD. The Supreme Court of the United States, in a number of cases,
                            have held that the States are sovereign.
                        Mr. DUNNING. That is not an answer to Chief Justice Story. If I should
                            speak upon this question, I will then invite the attention of the
                            gentleman to some other provisions in the Constitution of the United
                            States, in reference to the power of the General Government to amend the
                            Constitution, showing that the States have committed themselves to that,
                            power whenever they have ratified the Constitution and become members of
                            this great Confederacy. But I think I shall not speak upon this question
                            at all, for I consider it honor enough for me in my declining years, to
                            have voted for an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
                            that sets every man free that is made in the image and likeness of
                            God.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. When by the partiality of friends, a few months since I
                            was placed in nomination for the honorable position of a Senator in this
                            body, I most earnestly and sincerely protested against it, and after it
                            had been accepted for some months I proposed to the Central Committee to
                            resign and let some one else come here in my stead. But I feel glad my
                            resignation was not accepted. I am grateful to Almighty God that I stand
                            here with an opportunity soon to be offered to record my vote upon one
                            of the greatest measures ever before the sovereign people. And in years
                            to come I expect to call my children around me and tell them I was
                            permitted to a vote in the Indiana Senate for the final extinction of
                            one of the darkest crimes of which this nation has ever been a
                            coadjutor. And I feel that, my children will take a vast pride in saying
                            to their associates, as they grow up to manhood and womanhood, that
                            their father cast a vote in, the Indiana Senate on the side of just and
                            right, of good government and universal liberty.
                        Mr. V. then read extracts from the Constitution of the United States,to
                            show that the doctrine of State sovereignty was not recognized in that
                            venerated instrument; and also the 6th section of the Democratic
                            platform of the 8th of January, 1862, to show that the Democrats were
                            willing to change the Constitution when the every interest is to be
                            subserved; but now, when we propose to amend the Federal Constitution in
                            harmony with the provisions of that instrument, so as to remove the
                            cause of all our troubles, Democrats tell us we have not the power to do
                            it.
                        Mr. HANNA. A resolution was introduced here some days ago by the Senators
                            from Decatur, (Mr. Van Buskirk,) instruction the Senators, and
                            requesting the Representatives in Congress from Indiana to vote for the
                            Amendment of of the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting negro
                            servitude in any of the States.
                        That resolution was sent to the Committee on Federal
                                Relations, of which Committee I have the honor to be a
                            member. The late action of Congress has rendered unnecessary any formal
                            report of that Committee. The majority of the Committee, however, had
                            resolved upon acquiescence in the spirit of the resolution offered by
                            the Senator from Decatur, and intended to report the same back to Senate
                            with their endorsement of the recommendation asked.
                        The minority dissented from the proposed report of the majority of the
                            Committee, and with a view to the preparation of a minority report, I
                            had taken some pains to look over the great question presented by the
                            pending joint resolution, a question, Mr. President, so vast in its
                            proportions, that it has absorbed the mind and fired the heart of our
                            most distinguished Statesmen for three-quarters of a century. Yes, sir,
                            I may say this question goes further back than that-that it extends to
                            that august Convention in which the American Constitution had its
                            origin.
                        I know, Mr. President, I will be indulged, if on this occasion, I pause
                            in my argument for a few moments, to call to mind the noble aspirations,
                            the brilliant talents, the exalted patriotism, ah sir, and I bow my head
                            mournfully and in humiliation, when I think I may not as truthfully add
                            the enduring achievements of the annointed fathers who established and
                            promulgated the great Magna Charta of our liberties.
                        Since the memorable day that our blessed Lord and his chosen disciples
                            celebrated together for the last time, the feast of the Passover at
                            Jerusalem, the world has never seen such a convention of inspired men as
                            that which framed the Constitution of the United States, Sir, they live
                            and breathe now just as they did when they first assembled at
                            Philadelphia on the 28th day of May, 1787. There, Mr. President was the
                            colossal intellect and specious subtlety of Alexander Hamilton-the wise,
                            the  comprehensive and the analytic
                            mind of Madison-the parliamentary gladiature of Luther Martin-the
                            awkward but gigantic strides of Roger Sherman-the unshaken consistency
                            of Chancellor Lansing-the inspired eloquence of Bedford-and the classic
                            splendor and sarcastic tonat of Pinckney--noble spirits all. Sir, it was
                            they, and such as they, that gave us our Constitution-and upon it
                            founded that system of government that has come down to us through so
                            many storms of trial, and through so many golden years of prosperity and
                            honor,
                        Mr. President. The question to-day is change--reform--revolution, and it
                            is to this point strictly that I desire to speak. The past we know,
                            Sir,-the future is hidden from our vision. The old Constitution and the
                            old Government we know. We contemplate with pride and satisfaction the
                            developments of the American system of government under the auspices of
                            the Constitution of our fathers. Our advancement, our power and our
                            duration under it, have elicited the wonder and the admiration of the
                            whole civilized world.
                        I have listened to the remarks of Senators en the other side with deep
                            pleasure. Many of them have spoken eloquently and with force; but it
                            seems to me that in their discussion of the vital question now before
                            the Senate, they have exhibited too much of the spirit of party
                            trammels. We are called upon to-day to act as Senators-not as
                            distempered and misguided partisans. The issue is too momentous and the
                            responsibility too grave for anything like passion.
                        But, Mr. President, let us come at once to the main question. The General
                            Assembly of Indiana, is called upon to acquiesce in the action of
                            Congress for the abolishment of Negro servitude throughout all the
                            States where it exists. Some Senators who have spoken here seem to take
                            this view of the question. That if we vote against this joint resolution
                            we therefore publish to the world our sanction and approbation of the
                            system of African slavery as it has for many years existed and now
                            exists in a portion of the United States. But that if we vote for the
                            measure, we at once put ourselves within the pale of what some gentlemen
                            are pleased to call loyalty. And one word on this point. This word
                            loyalty has always struck me as a very unsuitable word to apply to an
                            American citizen living under a Republican form of Government. Its
                            meaning is obscure and indefinite. If the gentlemen who employ its use
                            so frequently, mean by it, respect for the laws, and love for the
                            Constitution that gives power for the employment and protection, then
                            sir, it is a significant and glorious word, but if they mean by it
                            abiding faith in party, and blind adhesion to all the acts, thoughts,
                            words and profession of representative party men, then I say of all the
                            words in the whole English vernacular it is the most damnable word.
                        Our votes will not argue either that we favor or disapprove of negro
                            slavery. Practically I regard that question for the present a most
                            insignificant one. It never has concerned me. I have always had an
                            abiding faith in the genius and mission of this Government. Its
                            Constitution, laid in the eternal principles of christianity, unless we
                            undermine it, and trample it down and destroy it, can not fail in the
                            end to work out the great problem which its founders designed it should.
                            The relation which the African race must sustain towards the noble, the
                            zealous, the conquering Anglo-Saxon, morally, socially, mentally and
                            politically is fixed and determined forever. They must be seperated, or
                            the one will rule the other in some form; their equality is an
                            impossibility, established upon, the decrees of God, and never seriously
                            denied, to my knowledge, until very recently, and that too, under a
                            strange and new born theory, denominated miscegination a new idea and a
                            corresponding word for its expression. But, Mr. President, I dismiss
                            that subject for the present and the proposition which I now lay down
                            and upon which I am willing to stand in this debate is this: that in the
                            formation of the Constitution of the United States, there was no grant
                            of Federal power over the domestic institutions of a State. In other
                            words, that it is outside of Federal power to grasp the reserved rights
                            of the States.
                        In support of my proposition, I propose, with the indulgence of the
                            Senate, to examine at some length the debates which transpired in the
                            Convention that made the Constitution, The intentions and declarations
                            of great men who framed that instrument, are to my mind very clearly set
                            forth. Let us call up that investigation here.
                        Mr. H. spoke at great length upon the debates in the Constitutional
                            Convention. He read from the speeches of Hamilton, Martin, Bedford,
                            Lansing and others, showing the spirit of the Federal and Democratic
                            elements, and with a view to support his theory that there were reserved
                            rights in the formation or the Constitution that cannot bo effected by
                            amendment.
                        I trust, Mr. President, by extracts from the secret proceedings of the
                            Convention that framed the Constitution of the United States, I have
                            shown that the great contest in that Convention was between the State
                            sovereignty or State rights men favorable to a Federal Union, based on
                            the principles of a representative Democracy, and the advocates of a
                            National Government, based on monarchical or aristocratic
                            principles.
                        I shall now briefly examine the declared purposes and powers of the
                            Federal Constitution--and upon my understanding of such purpose and
                            powers, enter my protest against the undertaking of two-thirds of
                            Congress, either to overthrow any one of the domestic institution of a
                            State or to establish a national government subordinating any one of the
                            States without its consent.
                        Sir, the proceedings of the General Convention of 1787 prove clearly to
                            my mind that the States asserted and maintained their equality. 
                        It will be found from an examination of the acts of the States appointing
                            or creating delegates to the General Convention of 1787 with power to
                            frame a Federal Constitution, that it was expressly stipulated, that the
                            same should be submitted to each State for ratification, and that
                            without such satisfaction it could not be binding on any State.
                         I am totally unable, sir, to find any power delegated by the States in
                            that Constitution,  empowering
                            two-thirds of Congress, and three-fourths of the Legislatures of States
                            to so amend the Constitution as to deprive the States of expressly
                            reserved rights to manage their domestic affairs agreeably to their own
                            wishes.
                        From every principle embodied in the acts of the States creating
                            delegates and empowering them to amend the Federal system by framing a
                            Constitution of General Government, for the common defense, to promote
                            the general welfare and to secure the domestic tranquility of the
                            States, I have no misgiving, sir, in the declaration that any such
                            amendment as that proposed by the pending joint resolution,would be
                            binding only upon such States as by express legislation gave their
                            sanction to it.
                        Therefore, Mr. President, I view the proposition calculated, if not
                            expressly intended to sanction and perpetuate a dissolution of the Union
                            of the States under the Federal Constitution; and, as such, I do
                            solemnly protest against its adoption. I say further, sir, that as the
                            uncompromising friend of States rights, and a Federal Union of the
                            States under the Constitution of the United States, based on
                            representation principles, I cannot be a party to lay political measure
                            that recognises the right of the majority to rule without
                            limitation.
                        Restraint, sir; limitations and barriers are the very breath, and life,
                            and strength of the constitution--the law of majorities, as well as the
                            law of minorities. Strict construction of the constitution is the
                            ancient faith of the friends of State sovereignty and federal union. If
                            two-thirds of Congress, Mr. President, and three-fourths of the
                            legislatures of States, can prohibit negro servitude in the States, may
                            they not likewise compel a State against its will to institute the
                            relation of master and servant within its confines--a monstrous
                            assumption to which I will not subscribe.
                        I believe further, sir, that the came power which can destroy any one of
                            the domestic institutions of a State may destroy them all, and thus
                            annihilate State sovereignties.
                        My great opposition to this measure, Mr. President, is from the fact that
                            I believe it is the first step towards the extinction of the identity of
                            States, and consequently the establishment of a centralizad
                            government.
                        Mr. NILES. As has been remarked by another Senator, I come here without
                            my own concurrence, and against my own strongest remonstrances ; but,
                            sir, the privilege of recording my vote upon this question, makes the
                            opportunity of enjoying a seat upon this floor the proudest moments of
                            my humble life. I cannot but look upon this as a great turning point in
                            human history--in human affairs. This, sir, is no ordinary era,it is no
                            common event, and in all earning time, while history retains its
                            records, it will stand like the revolution in England in 1688; like the
                            discovery of America by Columbus; like the declaration of Independence
                            on the 4th of July, 1776--an era from which men will date. This era has
                            not been brought upon the country by the party with which it is my pride
                            and happiness to cooperate. But, sir, when slavery seized the sword,
                            then I said, with nine-tenths, of the toyal men throughout the land, let
                            slavery perish by the weapon it has taken.
                        I was gratified at the remark of the Senator from Rush, [Mr. Cullen,] on
                            yesterday. It is not too solemn for an occasion and a crisis like the
                            present to say, that the Bible is the only safe rule of conduct for a
                            Christian nation. Sir, I was more delighted by the remark of the Senator
                            from Ohio, [Mr. Downey,] that it is safe to do right and trust the
                            consequences to Providence. Sir, permit me to say that when that Senator
                            shall make his last testament and finally wrap his robes about him, it
                            will be the richest legacy he could present to his children for them to
                            know, that on this occasion he threw oif the trammels of party and rose
                            to the magnitude of this great issue.
                        Mr. President: I will even go farther than Senators have. No nation can
                            prosper without the perpetual recognition of an over-ruling Providence;
                            and further, sir, no man can prosper--no nation can be permanently free
                            and happy unless they recognize in all their institutions, in all their
                            laws--aye, sir, in all their literature and in all their feelings, the
                            other great truth: the brotherhood of the human race.
                        Mr. N. continued for half an hour beyond the usual times for closing the
                            morning session.
                        And then came the recess for dinner.
                    





                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved that the special order for this hour-the Morgan
                            raid bill-be postponed and made the special order for Wednesday next at
                            2 1/2 P. M.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS. Is this Senate willing to act in this way? To postpone this
                            bill keeping these white men from their pay for property destroyed by
                            rebels more than eighteen months ago, for the sake of taking up a
                            proposition to benefit the negro? Have we so far forgotten our duty to
                            the white people of Indiana that we will follow in the footsteps of
                            Congress and legislate for the black man, while the white man is
                            suffering for relief by legislation? He trusted the motion would not be
                            consented to by the Senate.
                        Mr. CORBIN insisted that the special order should not be postponed
                            without good reason, and was sorry for the charge to be made that we
                            were not willing to attend to the interests of the white man. Were the
                            matter discussed this morning and now pending, postponed for a few days,
                            it would not effect the status of the negro--it would not make one more
                            slave or one more freeman.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 22.


                        
                            ARTICLE THIRTEEN.
                            Leave being granted, Mr. PEDEN introduced a bill, [S. 157,] to repeal
                                an act to enforce the 13th article of the Constitution, approved
                                June 18, 1852, which was read the first time and passed to the
                                second reading.
                        
                        
                            AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                                STATES.
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the consideration of the question
                                pending at the time of adjournment for dinner.
                            Mr. DUNNING demanded a call of the Senate.
                            It was ordered, and the Secretary reported six members absent.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. DUNNING the Doorkeeper was directed to bring in the
                                absentees.
                            Mr. OYLER moved to dispense with farther proceedings under the
                                call.
                            The motion was rejected upon a division-the Lieutenant Governor
                                voting in the negative.
                            Mr. DOUGLAS moved to recommit the joint resolution with instructions
                                to substitute the following:
                            
                                
                                    

                                        WHEREAS, The maintenance inviolate of
                                            the rights of the States, and especially the right of
                                            each State to order and control its own domestic
                                            institutions according to its own judgment, is essential
                                            to that balance of power on which the perfection and
                                            endurance of our political fabric depends;
                                            therefore,
                                        Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of
                                                the State of Indiana, That the amendment to the
                                            constitution of the United States, proposed by Congress
                                            and submitted to the several States for ratification, is
                                            inexpedient, and ought not to be made.
                                    
                                
                            

                            Mr. DOUGLAS remarked that this was the exact language of part of the
                                platform on which Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the
                                United States, the Republicans heartily endorsed it then, and now if
                                there was no change in their sentiments he would like to know it,
                                and if there was he wanted to see who it is that has changed.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BENNETT, this motion to recommit was laid on the
                                table by yeas 28, nays 21.
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, further proceedings under the call were
                                dispensed with.
                            Mr. CASON. If we were today about to organize a government this
                                question would not, perhaps, for a divided one. I do not suppose
                                there is a single Senator here who would, in each a case, vote to
                                establish the institution of slavery in our midst. If we look at
                                this as a new question, we would have but little trouble in coming
                                at what is right, for our better consciences would guide us and lead
                                us to establish a, government of universal liberty; and if it would
                                be right then, it is certainly right now. Therefore I wish only to
                                take issue on this question in the light of right or wrong; I wish
                                to hold the gentlemen to the fact that if they vote against this
                                joint resolution they vote for a wrong. And have they any
                                justification for doing so? As an abstract question there can be no
                                justification in voting for a wrong.
                            Mr. C. then traced the history of the slavery question from the time
                                of the organization of the government, reading historic acts in
                                support of the positions assumed in his argument against the
                                ''reserved rights" gentlemen talk so much about. Madison strove
                                successfully in the Federal Constitutional Convention against the
                                word "slave" going into that instrument which shows conclusively
                                that the members considered there were no reserved rights on that
                                subject. They would no more have established slavery than they would
                                have done any other great wrong. George Washington himself was a
                                free soiler--an Abolitionist in sentiment. Three-fourths of the men
                                that framed our Federal Constitution were Abolitionists in
                                sentiment, but to conciliate South Carolina and Georgia in that
                                critical hour, they were willing, for the time being, to recognize
                                the institution of slavery as being in existence, but they went no
                                farther. To charge that these men believed there were any reserved
                                right belonging to the States is a stigma upon the character of our
                                forefathers, In that age all enlightened men abhored this
                                institution--they loathed it. Jefferson did so, Franklin did so,
                                Washington did so. Where, outside of South Carolina and Georgia, can
                                they find any my so low and mean as to recognize as a fact this
                                slavery was right in itself ?
                            After reading several clauses in the Federal Constitution, commenting
                                upon the latter part of Article IX, he said, if the Constitution
                                could not be amended upon this point, ( the importance of slaves,)
                                why were they so particular about engrafting a clause prohibiting
                                such an amendment till after a certain time? This shows that the
                                question of slavery was considered by the convention, and carries
                                put my idea that they simply recognized the institution of slavery
                                expecting it in time to be swept from the United States. Common law
                                is founded upon justice and Blackstone says a law enacted upon as
                                other ground is invalid and of no force.
                            Why are we now in a state of war? Gentlemen may stifle their feelings
                                on this subject but they know, had there been no slavery in the
                                United States, there would be no war to-day Then if this is true,
                                has not slavery brought on this war? It is slavery that has robbed
                                us of our sons and brothers; it is slavery that has made widows and
                                orphans all over our land. And can you talk about the rights of any
                                individual who would perpetuate such a wrong? Do you ask us to
                                respect the right, of such because they hold property? Certainly,
                                Senators have not given this matter sufficient thought.
                            The Crittenden amendment would have in the course of time established
                                slavery upon every foot of soil the stars and stripes float over;
                                and to substantiate this assertion, Mr. C. read extracts from
                                letters written by Calhoun, Clay and Madison, commenting thereon as
                                he read.
                            He charged that the agitation of the slavery question originated with
                                the South-began there for the purpose of separation-and he honored
                                the Senator from Floyd [Mr. Bradley] for expressing the sentiment
                                that the South invited the war, and if slavery goes let it go with
                                the war. If slavery were out of the way, we would be united; then
                                why not lend a helping hand and let us put it out of the way? The
                                issue will divide us until it is settled. It is a divided North that
                                has kept up this war, and until we have a united North, by laying
                                down this slavery question, this war will go on, because God has
                                decreed that we shall give complete justice to the slave. Our action
                                is to be recorded in black and white, and there are persons,
                                communities and States looking with interest for this action in that
                                hour. The God of Heaven is looking down upon us this day, and in His
                                still small voice whispering to us to do justice to the poor slave
                                and the poor white man.
                             In conclusion, he replied to the statement that there would be a
                                revulsion of public sentiment about this matter, contending that
                                such a thing could not be as long as there is a God in Heaven.

                            Leave being granted, Mr. BEESON offered the following:
                            
                                
                                    

                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn,
                                            it will adjourn to meet at 7 1/2 o'clock this
                                            evening.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                             Mr. BROWN, of Wells, made an ineffectual motion to lay the
                                resolution on the table. Yeas 22, nays 23.
                            Mr. COBB moved to amend by striking out the words "7 1/2 o'clock this
                                evening," and inserting the word "9 o'clock to-morrow morning."
                             Mr. COBB demanded a call of the Senate. 
                            It was ordered, and six Senators were reported absent.
                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved that further proceedings under the call be
                                dispensed with.
                            
                            Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion to amend--yes 22, nays 23--by
                                directing the Door-Keeper to bring in the absent members.
                            
                             Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion-- yeas 18, nays 26-- to lay the
                                motion (Mr. Van Buskirk's) on the table.
                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK withdrew his motion.
                            
                            Mr. DOUGLAS made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 16, nays
                                31.
                             Mr. BEESON withdrew his resolution.
                        

                        
                             AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
                            
                            Mr. BEESON demanded the previous question.
                             The demand was seconded by twenty-six Senators. The question being,
                                "Shall the main question be now put?" 
                            It was ordered. 
                            Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate.
                            It was ordered, and the Secretary reported 15 absentees.
                            The joint-resolution than passed the Senate by yeas 26, nays 9, as
                                follows:
                            
                            
                                
                                    

                                        YEAS-Messrs. Allison, Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Brown, of
                                            Hamilton, Cason, Chapman, Culler, Culver, Davis, Downey,
                                            Dunning, Dykes, Hyatt, Milligan, Niles, Noyes, Oyler,
                                            Peden, Richmond, Terry, Thompson, Van Buskirk, Ward,
                                            Weeds and Wright-- 26.
                                        NAYS-Messrs. Bowman, Bradley, Clifford, Hord, Jenkins,
                                            McClurg, Moore, Vawter and Williams--9.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. MOORE, when his name was called, said: I have given a great many
                                votes in my life, but am about to give the most important I ever
                                gave. We have no chance to say anything in behalf of the cause we
                                are about to decide, but, I am glad I have got the right to vote as
                                I shall vote at the time. I vote "no." [Laughter.]
                            Mr. THOMPSON. This previous question has cut off my speech, but it
                                does not take away part of it--
                            Mr. GIFFORD (interrupting.) If members are allowed to make a speech
                                when they cast their votes, I wish to avail myself of that
                                privilege.
                             The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Gentlemen can explain their votes only by
                                unanimous consent.
                            Mr. THOMPSON. I vote "a-y-e." [laughter.]
                            So the joint resolution passed.
                             The announcement of the vote was greeted with wild shouts, stamping,
                                and other demonstrations of applause.
                        


                        
                             LEAVES ABSENCE.
                            Were obtained for Messrs. Noyes and Brown, of Wells, till Tuesday;
                                and Messrs. Bennett and Brown, of Hamilton, till Monday morning.
                        
                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                             Mr. BONHAM offered the following: 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn,
                                            it be till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, made an ineffectual motion to strike out
                                "to-morrow" and insert "Monday." 
                            The resolution was adopted.
                        
                        
                            AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                                STATES.
                            
                            Mr. COBB asked for leave to record his vote on the passage of the
                                joint resolution [S. 16],
                                The gentlemen of the opposition have treated me, until this question
                                came up, with that courtesy and respect I was entitled to, but upon
                                this question I insist they have not treated me and my friends, who
                                desired to place their remarks upon record, with that courtesy which
                                was our due. We have tried time and again to get this matter
                                postponed till we could be heard upon it, and when I saw a
                                disposition to pass this resolution over our heads I took the
                                liberty of going out at the time the previous question was seconded.
                                When Senators attempt to force me into matters which are not just
                                and right, I will take my own course and stand responsible for it to
                                my constituents only.
                            Mr. DUNNING. I cannot suffer the remarks of the Senator from Lawrence
                                [Mr. Cobb] to pass without making a statement about this matter,
                                because it reflects upon the party I see cause to co-operate with. I
                                undertake to say there has been fairness in this matter, and I
                                undertake to say the Senator from Lawrence has not been cut off from
                                debate.
                            Mr. COBB (interposing.) If the Senator will permit me, I say I
                                have.
                            Mr. DUNNING. The gentleman, no doubt, believe it I know it, sir. 
                            Mr. COBB. I don't believe it-- I know it, sir.
                            Mr. DUNNING. I don't dispute the word of the Senator; but whether it
                                is a fact or not, is a question of fact; and I undertake to say with
                                all the vehemence the gentleman may manifest--I undertake to say he
                                has not been cut off from debate, and his party has not been cut off
                                from debate. I undertake to say this arrangement for a bolt has
                                failed, and signally foiled, too. It is one of those programmes
                                arranged for a bolt in order to prevent the voice of the people from
                                being beard and from being carried out, that has signally foiled.
                                Without arrogating to myself any importance, I think it is just as
                                important that I should have communicated my views to the public and
                                to my constituents as to the reasons that actuated me in. casting my
                                vote, as it was that the Senator from Lawrence should do so, to say
                                the least of it. I am a much older man, and would have been glad to
                                have had an opportunity of expressing my views, particularly as I
                                have so long, in years gone by, been voting with the party of which
                                he is a member I don'r know but longer than the gentleman is old. I
                                hare been a Democratic voter, and generally with-  cut crossing a line, for thirty-seven
                                years. Sir, in the Legislative history of this State, my vote stands
                                recorded in favor of the internal improvement system; in favor of
                                the old State Bank, which has lived, done good, and gone down; and
                                in favor of all the great measures that have been adapted in this
                                State; but as much as I feel that I have reflected credit upon
                                myself and upon my constituents by giving such votes, I am proud to
                                say that my children, and grand children, if I have them, can have
                                the proud satisfaction of spying that I voted for this joint
                                resolution. Of all the votes I have given, I say to-day, in the
                                presence of Almighty God and this Senate, it is the proudest act of
                                my life, and I cherish it more than all the votes I have given
                                heretofore. [Applause] It has been nearly a third of a century since
                                I first entered the Legislature of the State, and probably with my
                                closing session have been able to give a vote that strikes th
                                shackles of slavery off the last negro in the United States.
                            Mr. COBB, The Senator says one thing which I wish to correct. He is
                                not a Democrat now, and hence he don't know much about the
                                Democratic party. He has not been acting with us in caucus, and
                                therefore for him to charge that this was a concerted plan far the
                                purpose of breaking up the Legislature, I think it come with bad
                                grace from the Senator.
                            Mr. DUNNING (interposing) I have no charged that it was a caucus
                                measure. I said it was a little programme--a preconcerted programme
                                of the Democratic party, or a portion of them at any rate, to break
                                up the Senate and prevent a vote being taken this evening.
                            Mr. COBB. But then I will say the Senator is still mistaken; that he
                                was not in a meet where this concert of action is alleged to have
                                been brought about, and when he makes this statement hs makes it
                                probably without any facts before him. I will state to the Senator
                                that I stepped out on my own responsibility, and without any concert
                                of action; what other Senators did, I presume they did upon their
                                own responsibility.
                            Mr. DUNNING (interposing.) The gentleman says I was not in the
                                session of their caucus and I don't know anything about what was
                                going on. If I take a revolver from my pocket and shoot Dr. Thompson
                                here, the Senator from Marion, the presumption of law is I intended
                                to murder him; and when a vote is taken on the most important
                                subject before the Senate and Senators on the other side leave their
                                seats, sensible people can judge correctly the motive that prompts
                                them.
                            Mr. COBB. That depends very much upon the facts passing before the
                                Senate. I must say again the Senator is mistaken. He does not state
                                the facts correctly; I don't pretend to say he misstates them
                                intentionally, but I only attribute it to his great age and want of
                                memory on the subject. Is it not a well known fact that while this
                                question was being discussed, as I understood it, Senators wanted to
                                press this question to-night-, and if that was done I knew I could
                                not be here. I knew that a number of my friends who wanted to be
                                hard upon this question, and who had been making preparation to my
                                own knowledge, could not be heard; and when I knew time would not be
                                granted them, I was willing my own time should be cut off I was
                                willing to go down with them. And in order to get a second to the
                                previous question count after count was compelled to be taken by the
                                President. Two counts were had, and on each occasion the President
                                decided the question was not seconded; but so anxious were the
                                Senators, that they again forced the Chair to make another count,
                                After making two fair counts, and deciding the previous question not
                                seconded, they insisted again that a re-count must be had. These are
                                the facts. We were sitting here, not allowed to accept any
                                proposition.
                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK (interrupting ) I will ask the Senator is there in
                                his own mind a single doubt as to whether there were 23 Senators
                                seconding the demand for the previous question?
                             Mr. COBB. I shall not decide that question, except so far as the
                                decision of the Chair goes. I suppose the chair decided correctly. I
                                do not take issue upon that question at all, sir. But I undertake to
                                state facts that passed before the Senate, misrepresented from want
                                of memory, no doubt.
                            Mr. DUNNING (in his seat.) I say I have not misrepresented facts. I
                                suppose the gentleman on account of non-age and non-ability---
                            Mr. COBB. I suppose the Senator is old enough--as he says he has been
                                living and voting as long as I have lived-- to administer a rebuke
                                to me. I have been told the Senator made five speeches for Lincoln
                                and five for McClellan, in his usual able and forcible manner--
                            Mr. DUNNING (in his seat.) If I made able speeches, I did what the
                                Senator from Lawrence is not able to do. [Laughter]
                            Mr. COBB. That may be, sir. But as I was about to say, I attended a
                                large meeting in that gentleman's country, which ratified the
                                nomination of McClellan and Pendleton, and left the assembly while
                                that gentleman was making a speech--
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (interrupting,) suggested that gentlemen were
                                not speaking to the question before the Senate, which was on
                                granting leave to the Senator from Lawrence to record his vote. 
                            Mr. BENNETT. With the kindest feelings toward the Senator, I object,
                                and the reason I object is that his name was called at the proper
                                time, and he was not here to vote; and while he may say it was not a
                                preconcerted movement, a Democratic Senator told me an hour before
                                that if the previous question was moved they did intend to bolt.
                             Mr. COBB. I do not desire to cast my vote upon this question against
                                the feeling of any Senator; and therefore, for the purpose of
                                restoring order, I withdraw the request.
                             Mr. BENNETT moved to reconsider the vote just taken on the passage
                                of the joint resolution [S. 16,] and to lay that motion on the
                                table. 
                            The latter motion was agreed to.
                             Mr. ENGLISH asked to record his vote on the passage of the joint
                                resolution. He said: I desire leave to make a statement why I was
                                absent, and I have a letter which I desire the  clerk to read, showing why. I have
                                never, sir,in my life, in the course of eleven years' service in
                                this Senate and the other end of the Capitol, bolted on any
                                occasion, and I don't intend to while I have my senses. I have a
                                desire to vote on this occasion, and to record that vote for the
                                purpose of my people seeing the course I have pursued on this
                                subject; and I desire to record my vote on the Democratic side of
                                this thing. I have espoused that side from the time I was old enough
                                to vote, and have been faithful to that party from that time to
                                this, and with the help of God I desire to die so. This letter will
                                show why I was out of my seat at the time. [The letter was then read
                                by the Secretary.] 
                            Now, sir, these [those referred to in the letter,] are my neighbor's
                                children, and they are here as volunteers to release the township of
                                Lexington, which I live in, from the draft and I know that letter
                                contains the truth. I went and consulted the Senator from Floyd the
                                subject, and he advised me to go and see about it, and I went and
                                got a permission for these men to get a furlough to enable them to
                                wind up their little affairs at home. I offer this as the truth, and
                                desire to record my vote upon this subject. If Senators are not
                                disposed to let me do it it is foa them to decide. I don't ask any
                                favors outside of right, and I don't think there are any Senators
                                here that would have pursued the same course I did. I did not have
                                the slightest idea this question would be out till to-morrow, and
                                perhaps not till Monday. I think I have a right to vote, and I think
                                this Senate ought to grant that privilege net only to me but to
                                other Senators. It is not worth while to stand here and argue this
                                question.--Every Senator in the room was satisfied weeks ago what
                                course he would take, and these debates have been a waste of time,
                                and have not made the slightest inroad upon the sentiment of one
                                single man. I ask again, sir, the privilige of recording my
                                vote.
                            Mr. PEDEN moved that leave be granted.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by allowing any Senator who may desire to
                                record his vote.
                            
                            The latter motion was agreed to, and Messrs. Barker, Brown of Wells,
                                Carson, Cobb, Gorbin, Douglas, English, Fuller, Gaff, Hanna, Mason,
                                Newlin and Staggs, recorded their votes in the negative.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, when his name was called, said : I desired to
                                make some remarks upon this subject, but the previous question has
                                cut them off. I shall vote against this resolution, for the reason
                                that I regard it, sir, as only one other stride on the part of the
                                Federal Government towards a centralization of power towards the
                                wiping out of State lines and State rights. I vote ''no."
                            Mr. CARSON, when his name was called, said : As a reason for the vote
                                I give upon this occasion, I would state that I have been opposed to
                                the Republican party from its incipiency : I have found nothing
                                growing out of if, from beginning to end, but desolation, ruin,
                                death and devastation. I vote with the Democratic party, and I shall
                                vote "no."
                            Mr. COBB. I shall vote upon this question now, and the reasons for
                                that vote are these, in brief: I think this is not an opportune time
                                for changing the fundamental law of the country; and I have very
                                grave doubts whether the twenty-seven States required in the
                                language of the Constitution to change that instrument have the
                                power to do it; but as far as that is concerned, I shall not state
                                emphatically my position in regard to it. This, sir, is no time for
                                trifling with the fundamental law of the country. That constitution
                                was made at a time when men reflected upon what they were doing.
                                That Constitution expected us from a small band of patriots to grow
                                in wealth and population to a mighty empire under its benign
                                influences.--
                            Mr. THOMPSON (interrupting.) I rise to a point of order, Mr.
                                President. You knocked me down when I was about to explain my vote.
                                [Laughter.]
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Because it was objected to. If you object to
                                the Senator's explanation it is not in order.
                            Mr. THOMPSON. I had a speech prepared, and didn't want this thing to
                                come off till I had delivered it, but if I thought the gentleman
                                from Lawrence would not make a long speech I should not object.
                            Mr. COBB, I shall not attempt to inflict a speech upon the Senate. I
                                was going on to state, in explanation of my vote, that the
                                Constitution has stood upon our statute books as the supreme law of
                                the land; and now when this country is drenched in fraternal blood,
                                when in the midst of a civil war the public sentiment is
                                vascillating, first to one side and then to the other; at a time
                                when men do not ; reflect as they ought when they approach that
                                instrument made sacred by the hands of the men who framed it, I
                                might go on and state many evil effects of an attempt to repeal this
                                section of the Constitution. It is said we have full power to amend
                                the Constitution, but, sir, here is a proposition to blot out a
                                provision instead of amending it, and some of our wisest men have
                                taken the position that we have no power to abolish any portion of
                                the Constitution. In doing so you destroy, in my opinion, some of
                                the fundamental principles which underlie this great Republic of
                                ours-which underlie the foundation of the rights of the people. It
                                is not the negro question-not the slavery question, but a higher,
                                greater and more noble principle will fell to the ground if this
                                amendment be made to the Constitution. Sir, it is no ordinary
                                matter, as I desired to say to the Senate in such remarks as I could
                                had I the time to prepare them. I desired to go into the facts of
                                this question, and show the effects this amendment would have not
                                upon negro slavery, but upon human rights-the rights of white men. I
                                submit, sir, it strikes down the very foundation of State
                                Government; for I can show by the language of the best statesmen in
                                our land, that this is a question left to the States and the people
                                of the States. I will state this proposition without argument: I
                                undertake to say twenty-seven States of this Union may revolutionize
                                and adopt an amendment abolishing a portion of the Constitution, and
                                may go out of the old Union, leaving a remaining one fourth in the
                                Union. It is a step that, if persisted in, will redound to the
                                destruction of this beautiful 
                                frame work of ours; and I want to say that I stand here before this
                                people, my constituents and spirits of patriots who have passed away
                                with all the responsibility assumed by me ia casting my rose against
                                this important measure.
                             This amendment is inexpedient for another reason. It turns loose
                                between three and four millions of the black race upon this people
                                of the North, who have none of the sin of slavery upon their
                                shoulders. I always have been opposed to slavery, and I would make
                                it a condition precedent to the abolition of slavery, to colonize
                                these negroes and send them off from our people.
                            I shall not extend my remarks any further, but I will say to the
                                Senators I have no fear with regard to the responsibility of this
                                vote. I shall look to it the longest day I live with satisfaction.
                                If I am able to look down the vista of the future, my impressions
                                are strong that to the very last moments of my existence upon this
                                earth I will feel that I have cast a vote to-day, not to fasten
                                slavery upon this country, but I will feel that I have attempted, in
                                my feeble way, to reject a proposition which will tear down the
                                fundamental principles of our Constitution. But, sir, a mere vote
                                upon this question was not what I desired I wanted to put my vote
                                upon the record, but further than that, I wanted to put my reasons
                                upon the record against this proposition. I wanted them, to go upon
                                the page of history, for I shall look upon it as one of the
                                brightest pages of my history.
                            Mr. CORBIN, where his name was called, said: If it would not be
                                asking too much, I would like to give is a few words, my reasons for
                                voting in the manner in which I shall.
                            Mr. OYLER. I have a resolution prepared that I ask may be read for
                                information, which I think will get along this matter in a manner
                                satisfactory to all. [The resolution is printed hereafter.]
                            Mr. DUNNING. I would suggest that Senators who desire shall write out
                                their speeches, and they shall be considered as having been
                                delivered here, and constitute a part of the BREVIER REPORTS, if we
                                conclude to take the BREVIER REPORTS, and of course the papers will
                                give us an opportunity of publishing them if we desire.
                            Mr. CORBIN. I have no desire to take up the time of the Senate, and
                                am willing to consent to anything thought most reasonable, for I am
                                exceedingly anxious that the Senate should get along in such a
                                manner as will be harmonious. I have had no desire to prevent the
                                majority from carrying out their wishes in this matter; my desire
                                has been, from the beginning, simply to have a free and fair
                                interchange of expression upon this question, and after that let the
                                vote be taken and each one stand upon his own responsibility.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells. I would say that I am in favor of the resolution
                                of the Senator from Johnson [Mr. Oyler,] for the reason that in the
                                course of my remarks I intend to advert to a great many things that
                                have been said on this floor by Senators who have already spoken,
                                and they should here have an opportunity to reply if necessary. For
                                me to set down and write out a speech, such as I intend to deliver
                                would be much more in consonance with my feelings; but it would not
                                be proper to writs out and publish any speech in the way
                                proposed.
                            Mr. COBB, If the resolution meets the approbation of Senators it
                                certainly meets mine for the reason given by the Senator from
                                Wells.
                            Mr. HANNA, when his name was called, said: Believing I have the full

                                        Resolved, That every Senator who
                                            desires, have the liberty to address the Senate upon the
                                            joint resolution, No. 16, it any time during the
                                            session, and that Friday of next week be set apart
                                            specially for that purpose.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted.

                        FRIDAY, February 10, 1865.
                    
                    The House met at 9 o'clock, A. M. 
                    On motion by Mr. BROWN the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                    
                        PETITION.
                        Mr. GREGG presented a memorial with reference to bills now before the
                                Committee on Corporations, and without reading it
                            was referred to that committee.
                    
                    
                        PUBLICATION OF THE LAWS.
                        Mr. HIGGINS, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            returning Mr. Whiteside's bill [H. R. 145,] for the publication of the
                            acts of the General Assembly is the county newspaper reported adiversely
                            to the proposition on account of the expense, it would involve of more
                            than $2,300 to each newspaper authorized to publish the laws.
                        Mr. KILGORE, from a majority of the Committee on
                                Elections, reported on the Putnam contested election case,
                            throwing out the returns from Cloverdale township, on the presumption
                            and proof of fraud, and so finding a majority of 33 votes for Higgins
                            Lane over Austin M. Puett, and a majority of one vote for Ambrose E
                            Hamrick over Samuel Colover. The majority of the committee report
                            resolution to the effect, That Higgins Lane and Ambrose E. Hamrick at
                            the last October election were duly elected Representatives for the
                            county of Putnam, and as such are entitled to seats on the floor; and
                            that Austin M. Puett and Sam Colover were not elected at said election,
                            and are not as Representatives entitled to seats on this floor. 
                        Mr. KILGORE asked that the report be taken up and acted on now.
                        Mr. BROWN was very much surprised at the conclusion to which the majority
                            had come.  If the sitting members
                            were fraudulently elected they should not have his vote; but he wanted
                            time to investigate the facts and the law in the conclusion that the
                            sitting members were legal Representatives of Putnam county.
                        Mr. KILGORE. The committee had worked four weeks, and it was not till
                            yesterday evening that they were able to get through. If gentlemen have
                            the time they will ask for, four weeks more will be consumed before we
                            can reach a conclusion. The contestants had been here all the time with
                            their testimony and attorneys, and ample opportunity had been given for
                            examinations; and it was injustice to withhold their seats from
                            them.
                        Mr. LASSELLE asked for time to make a minority report If he had been
                            apprised that the report would be made this morning, he should have been
                            ready. He submitted considerations which should allow this time. One of
                            the contestants (Mr. Lane) was willing to defer action till Monday 2
                            o'clock.
                        Mr. BRANHAM suggested to-morrow 10 o'clock, and made the motion
                            accordingly.
                        The motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered.
                    
                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, for the committee on
                            Education, returned, Mr. Rhoads' Normal School bill No. 119,
                            with the expression of opinion that the establishment of such an
                            institution would be highly beneficial to the State, and with a
                            recommendation that the bill pass. He also returned Mr. Olleman's Clerks
                            bill No. 154.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, for the Committee on Ways and
                                Means returned Mr. Branham's Assessment bill (No. 158,)
                            with a motion that the same be laid on the table and that there be
                            printed 300 copies thereof.
                        Mr. BRANHAM said 100 copies were intended for the Senate, the report was
                            concurred in, and the printing ordered.
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren, from the Committee on
                            Education, returned Mr. Rice's House of Refuge joint
                            resolution, No, 14, reporting that the Constitution provides for a House
                            of Refuge, and recommending its passage, with an amendment, striking out
                            the clause which appoints a commission to visit other States, and making
                            appropriotions to defray his expenses.
                        He also returned Mr. Shoaff, of Allen's Foreign Language School bill, No.
                            113, amendatory of the school law of 1855, reporting that the law of
                            1855 is superceded by the law of 1861, and recommending that the bill do
                            not pass.
                        He also returned the resolution and instructions by Mr. Miller of
                            Tippecanoe, with reference to the German language in the common schools,
                            reporting the opinion that further legislation on the subject was
                            inexpedient.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on Military Affairs,
                            returned Mr. Speaker Pettit's Military Claims bill, No. 156, reporting
                            amendments:

                        
                             Striking out section 11, and substituting matter to the
                                effect that, if any officer named in the act shall refuse to perform
                                the duty imposed on him, he shall be liable to an action by the
                                claimant party for the damages he may have sustained.

                             Filling a blank, and inserting an emergency clause.
                        
                        And, so amended, the committee recommended the passage of the bill.

                            said act is inexpedient, and recommending that the bill be laid on the
                            table.
                        Mr. BURNES and Mr. STEWART reported from the Committee on

                        CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House resolved into Committee of
                                the Whole-Mr. Henricks in the Chair-and thereupon on his
                            further motion, the Committee rose, and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported the bill-Mr. Whiteside's joint resolution, No.
                            13--to the House without amendment.
                        The joint resolution was then ordered to the second reading, and read the
                            second time.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the joint resolution was again referred to the
                                Committee of the Whole.
                        Whereupon, the House again resolved into Committee of the
                                Whole-Mr. Henricks in the Chair-and took up again the
                            consideration cf the Executive Message communicating proposed amendments
                            of the Constitution of the United States by the Congress thereof,
                            together with Mr. Whiteside's joint resolution, No. 13, for the
                            ratification of said Constitutional amendments.
                        Mr. HARRISON stated the conclusions of his mind against the passage of
                            the joint resolution. He reasoned against the power of Congress to
                            abolish slavery on the ground of the reserved rights of the State
                            quoting legal expositions of the Constitution, and Mr. Lincoln's opinion
                            confirming his position. He urged his opposition in. conclusions drawn
                            from the Declaration of Rights that governments derive their just powers
                            from the consent of the governed. It was simply the power in this case
                            that gave the right. He had no interest in slavery, neither was he its
                            apologist in any sense. The proposed amendment was not advisable,
                            negatively because it could not bring peace. Neither the confiscation
                            act nor the emancipation proclamation had either brought peace, nor
                            could any or all of these abolish slavery. The fact that neither the
                            confiscation act nor the proclamation had abolished slavery was taken
                            far confessed, in the fact that this proposition is before us. He urged
                            considerations to show the futility of the political dogma, that this
                            Union could not be maintained half free and half slave. This amendment
                            would no more abolish slavery than had Mr. Lincoln's proclamation. The
                            bayonet alone could accomplish the abolition of slavery. He doubted the
                            philanthropy of abolition, and contended that it was disproved in the
                            fact that negro emancipation did not improve their social condition. 
                        And it would injure positive the white race-it would level downward. He
                            replied to the allegation that all traitors and all secret treason
                            political organizations voted the Democratic ticket. His county voting 600 majority never had a
                            secret meeting of Democrats.
                        Mr. Harrison's argument, condensed, was a follows:
                        
                            1st. It is a proposition to change the organic law of the land; by
                                the exercise of a power no delegated by the Constitution to
                                Congress.
                            2d. The Constitution declares that all powers not delegated by the
                                Constitution to Congress, nor prohibited by it to the States, is
                                reserved to the States respectively or to the people.
                            3d. Slavery is a local and domestic institution, and is the
                                creature of local and State laws. At the adoption of the present
                                Constitution slavery existed in twelve of the thirteen original
                                States, and the right to hold slaves was then considered, as it has
                                ever been since, a reserved right in the States, and not a delegated
                                right.
                            4th. All power is inherent in the people, and our government is
                                founded on the theory that it derives all its just powers from the
                                consent of the governed. The slaveholding States are to be governed
                                by this amendment, without being even consulsted, and deprived of
                                their property without compensation.
                            5th. This amendment, if adopted and ratified by three-fourths of
                                the States, is an abandonment of our former position in regard to
                                the conduct of the war, and relates back to that abolition heresy
                                that was uttered and put forth in 1858, that there was an
                                irrepressible conflict going on between freedom and slavery; that
                                this Government cannot exist part slave and part free. Our past
                                history for more than three quarters of a century, is a sufficient
                                answer and refutation to this heresy.
                            6th. Suppose this amendment is ratified by three-fourths of the
                                States, slavery will then have been abolished by law; but will not
                                the rugged issue remain to be solved by force of arms and at the
                                point of the bayonet? The war will then go on for this purpose, and
                                slavery will have to be abolished amid the war of artillery, the
                                rattle of musketry, and the crash of armed hosts.
                        
                        The present Constitution is adequate for all purposes, of war as well as
                            of peace, amid the earthquake throes of civil strife and the conflicts
                            of a foreign war, in every struggle in which our country has hitherto
                            been engaged, it has borne us triumphantly through. Under it the
                            rebellion can be suppressed and the Union of our fathers restored.
                        Does this kind of legislation tend to better the condition of the slave?
                            I, for one, have been disposed to doubt the philanthropy of those who
                            profess to be the exclusive friends of the negro. Freedom to the slave
                            under the policy of the Administration leads but to degeneration and the
                            grave.
                        This amendment can only be justified on the ground of revolution; that it
                            is right to adopt it simply because we have the power to do it. For
                            these and other reasons that I might urge, I shall vote against the
                            proposed amendment.
                        Mr. BOYD said the opposition to this joint resolution proceeded as though
                            there was no war. He did not discuss the Constitutional question. But
                            the lawyers claimed a right higher than the Constitution-the right of
                            the people. The power of the people to make the Constitution certainly
                            could change it He regarded the war policy of the Administration with
                            favor. The only change in that policy had been brought about by the
                            rebels themselves. The speeches of the opposition here were based on the
                            doctrine of secession. Such was his judgment. The party that elected Mr.
                            Lincoln were not abolitionists; were not disposed to interfere with
                            property in slaves. Mr. Lincoln declared in his inaugural address that
                            he did but quote from his own former speeches, when he declared that he
                            had no disposition either directly or indirectly to interfere with
                            slavery, and that he had no legal right to do so, and then quoted the
                            resolution of similar purport in the Chicago Platform of 1860, which was
                            a law to him. He contended that this policy was changed, for the same
                            reason, that he would have the right to wrest the bludgeon from the hand
                            of a man about to strike him with it.
                        He showed how the liberation of the slaves of the South was weakening the
                            armies of the South and add them to our own armies, to the relief of our
                            own brave boys, both in the ditches and on the battle-field, and it was
                            but common justice that such should not be returned to slavery. It did
                            not follow that because the blacks were free, they should be invested
                            with all our legal and social rights. But gentlemen of the opposition
                            claimed consideration because the Democratic party have so long
                            administered and controlled the affairs of this country. He read from a
                            pamphlet in bis hand which charged that the Democratic States in the
                            North had violated the provision of the Constitution with reference to
                            the return of fugitive slaves. He did not say that the charge was true,
                            but it was held and often made. He showed that the Democratic party
                            could not compose our difficulties, by reference to the sloth and
                            hesitancy of the Buchanan Administration, which did not know whether to
                            "gee, haw, or jump the stump," Old Jim Buchanan, when this rebellion was
                            in its inception, was like the old farmer plowing with the assistance of
                            his wife. She had started him through several rounds, when at last he
                            came to a stump. "My dear," said he, "shall I gee, haw, or jump the
                            stump?" So it was with old granny Buchanan. He, when the critical time
                            came to act, did not know whether to gee, haw, or jump the stump.
                        That administration did not dare to act out the war power of the
                            Government. And this gave confidence to the rebels; as did the acts of
                            Democratic conventions in the State of Indiana. He did not believe the
                            body of Democrat in the State were opposed to war, and though the
                            gentleman from Monroe disclaimed opposition to the war, yet he found the
                            Speaker of the House of Representatives at the last session voting
                            against tabling a resolution that there should be given to the support
                            war, no more men, and no more money. He referred to page 59 of the last
                            House journal.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK rose to an explanation, but it was repressed by cries of
                            "No" from Republicans. He gave notice that he should claim the floor in
                            reply.
                        
                        Mr. BOYD proceeded. He compared the records of the Union, or Republican
                            party, and the Democratic party. The Union party had no Buchanans, or
                            Joseph Lanes. He was proud of the unvaunting and tolerant record of his
                            party. He defended it from the imputation of abolitionism, and showed
                            how the sectional breach was widened by the course, the acts and the
                            votes of the Democratic party. He showed that the conclusions which he
                            held, and which induced him to vote for this amendment, place him in
                            company with Thomas Jefferson. He quoted the Jefferson
                            "wolf-by-the-ears" letter, and concluded if that patriarch were living
                            now, he would be with the Union party on this question.
                        Mr. B denounced the Cincinnati Enquirer and the Indiana State Sentinel.
                            He held these papers more accountable than any of the rebels themselves.
                            These papers had been read in the South, and their words had gone
                            further to fire the Southern heart than anything which could be uttered
                            among their own people. Uniformly these papers, whether intended or not,
                            had been against the war, against the Government and in sympathy with
                            the rebels. For himself he considered it his duty to stand up for the
                            people of the North. He was willing that these papers, and gentlemen who
                            followed them, might do as they pleased in the regard. He was like the
                            boy whose father, who was very unpopular, was running for Justice of the
                            Peace. The little fellow went through the crowd shouting "Hurrah for
                            daddy!" "Hurrah for the devil," said some old cock in reply. "That's
                            right," said the boy, "let every one hurrah for his own kin folks." So
                            he said with regard to these papers and these gentlemen, but for himself
                            he hurrahed for "daddy;" he hurrahed for the Government of the United
                            States and the Union under a free constitution.
                        Mr. BECKETT considering the importance of this question, addressed the
                            Committee at the hazard of his personal health. The gentleman last on
                            the floor, claiming to be a Democrat, reminded him of the skunk in the
                            foxes hole-he did not talk, look or smell like a Democrat, Mr. B. took a
                            legal view of the question. He showed that the right of constitutional
                            amendment was limited to the spirit and scope of the Constitution
                            itself, and not in contravention of it. We have a right to change the
                            Constitution in any particular not fundamental. Would any man contend
                            that a, Constitutional amendment, greeting a monarchy at Washington,
                            could compel the acquiescence of the State of Indiana? He also derived
                            an opposing argument drawn from the reserved rights of the States and
                            the people. It was just as reasonable to abolish the negro race, as to
                            propose to abolish slavery. He also compared the political records of
                            partizan leaders, and showed that the rebellious confederation was first
                            induced by abolition agitation and extra-constitutional legislation in
                            the anti-slavery States; and them invited by evincing a disposition to
                            separate and divide the Union. This pending constitutional amendment was
                            striking at State Rights, the reserved rights of the people, the rights
                            of property, and the right of popular sovereignty.
                        Mr. GROVES rose in reply to the gentleman from Dubois--that Perry and
                            Dubois might be heard together; The day was when it would be dangerous
                            to make an Abolition speech on that border. But gentlemen here seem to
                            speak as though they regarded freedom and Republicanism as incompatible.
                            After the sacrifices for freedom, he would not stop short of universal
                            freedom. He was that sort of a Democrat. He had never been an
                            Abolitionist, though it had often been charged against him. But he was
                            now going to do that which might give their charge the color of truth:
                            he would vote for the amendment to abolish slavery throughout the land ;
                            and he expected to regard it as the proudest act of his life. To those
                            who expected to offer a more vigorous opposition to the war on account
                            of this amendment, he would say, look to your laurels, and take care
                            that the blacks in the army do not outstrip you in patriotism. He
                            proposed compensation for slaves by confiscating enough of rebel
                            property to pay for the slaves of loyal men. He had told the people of
                            Kentucky that rebels forfeited the right of protection. Union men in
                            that State make the same issue that we have here-the Union against
                            slavery.
                        Mr. SHUEY next took the floor, but gave way after a suggestion that the
                            time ought to be equally divided between the two parties.
                        Mr. SIM was willing to give advantage to the opposition as to time.
                        Mr. DUNHAM urged the Chair to restrain demonstrations of applause, and
                            all tendency, on this floor to the disorder of a mere primary
                            meeting.
                        The CHAIRMAN said all demonstrations of applause or otherwise were out of
                            order, and ought to be restrained. He called the attention of the
                            Doorkeeper to the matter.
                        Mr. LASSELLE. The questions involved in this debate were too grave and
                            important to admit of partisan considerations. He begged, however, in
                            reply to the allegation of Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe, that all rebels
                            arose out of the Democratic party, to say, that in the Southern States,
                            out of 856,000 votes cast at the presidential election of 1856,
                            346,000-nearly one-half-were given against the Democratic candidate.
                            This question over-rides all other questions. This was the first time
                            Indiana had been called upon to make any alteration in the Federal
                            compact. It may never be in our power to recall what we shall do to-day.
                            He should vote against the amendment. It was not a question of party
                            with him. He denied the power to make the amendment. He denied the right
                            and justice thereof. He denied its expediency.
                        He should vote against the amendment, for a very few reasons. In the
                            first place, involved questions of right, of power and expediency. It
                            would seem on the first blush that we have the power, because there is
                            no prohibition. But he showed that no amendment could be adopted to the
                            Articles of Confederation before the Constitution, without the eon-sent
                            of every State. It was the declaration of the fathers, and a tradition
                            of the people, that no right of a State, nor any right of property,
                            shall be interfered with or disturbed. Prohibitions of change and
                            amendment of the Consti- 
                            [Consti]tution were in the Constitution itself with regard to the right
                            of States, &c., as, that the equal right of all the States to equal
                            representation in the Senate of the United States, shall not be impaired
                            without the consent of such State. From this, he argued at least the
                            doubtfulness of the power to pass this amendment, because it affected
                            the rights of Scale's and property. He alleged the consideration that
                            this amendment was not right, not only because it was to affect the
                            structure of the Government, but because it infringed the vested rights
                            of property. And he computed the number and value of the slaves, asking
                            if gentlemen could regard it as an equitable thing "to strike down this
                            right to property? ["Yes;" "yes"]
                        He could not, though admitting, as he did, the intrinsic evil of slavery.
                            And he referred to the fact, that the State of Delaware had but day
                            before yesterday declared by an overwhelming majority, in both branches
                            of the Legislature, that she would not ratify this amendment. There was
                            reason to think also that Kentucky would make the same remonstrance. We
                            had every assurance that Kentucky would reject it. Was it right to force
                            a law on these States, depriving their citizens of their property ? Even
                            rebels. although they had committed the highest of crimes, had some
                            rights under the law. He exhorted gentlemen to be careful against
                            running into extremes. Already we had extremities enough upon us. He was
                            not a sixty day man, but he hoped our difficulties would be terminated
                            in a year or two. Then, as a matter of prudence, as a matter of
                            expediency, would it not be better to await that time, when, perhaps, we
                            might have the endorsement of all the States. He would like to see this
                            provision engrafted upon the Constitution, but he desired to see it done
                            by every State in the Union.
                        He would have the Committee to be guarded against extreme action. It was
                            difficult for him properly to restrain his own feeling of indignation
                            against this wicked rebellion. And, however, he might desire the
                            destruction ot slavery, he could not vote now for this proposition. It
                            was true, as alleged by Mr. Boyd, that Mr. Jefferson was in favor of
                            emancipation, but not in this way. Mr. Jefferson was in favor of State
                            rights.
                        Mr. Griffith next took the floor, but gave way for--
                        Mr. BROWN, on whose motion the Committee rose, and--
                        The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to sit again
                            at 2 o'clock P. M.
                        The report was concurred in. 
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN an order was adopted for an afternoon session: and
                            then-
                        The House took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M,
                    

                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM gave notice of intention to move an order for an evening
                            session.
                        And then, on his motion, the House resolved into Committee of
                                the WholeMr. Henricks in the Chair-and the committee again
                            took up the Executive message and Mr. Whiteside's joint resolution No.
                            13, for the amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with the courtesy of the House,
                            I will endeavor in a few remarks to give my views upon the joint
                            resolution amending the Constitution of the United States.
                        I do not propose to give a legal or constitutional argument, for I am not
                            able so to do neither will I attempt to argue it in a politics party
                            sense, but in what might be considered by some an abolition sense, in
                            other word; upon the merits of the question, upon the moral right
                            thereof.
                        I may be considered before I get through, a political-abolitionist. I
                            admit, sir, that eve since I had a thought, ever since I knew anything,
                            that I have been a MORAL abolitionist, but a political abolitionist I
                            never have been, until the inauguration of the present rebellion.
                        Since eighteen hundred and sixty-one a charge has come over the spirit of
                            my dreams, and I have progressed in that respect.
                        I will take the language of the gentleman from Cass as a sufficient text
                            for my remarks, and will ask, as he did first, is it right to ratify
                            this joint resolution? Secondly, is it expedient so to do?
                        As to the question of right, the 5th Article of the Constitution of the
                            United States provides that whenever two-thirds of both Houses of
                            Congress shall propose amendments to the Constitution, and the same
                            shall be ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the States the
                            same shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the
                            Constitution, thus setting the question of right and power to do so. 
                        Then again, the same Article provides that no amendment which may be made
                            prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any
                            manner affect the first clause if the 9th section of the first Article?
                            What is the first clause? It reads as follows:
                        
                            "The migration or importation of such persons as
                                any of the States now existing shall think proper admit shall not be
                                prohibited by Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred
                                and eight, but a tax may be imposed on such importation not
                                exceeding ten dollars for each person."
                        
                        What is the inference to be drawn therefrom. Does not this very language
                            not only look to the abolition of the slave trade but also imply that
                            slavery itself might be also abolished at some future period by the
                            authority of Congress?
                        Now gentlemen here talk about vested rights; about going contrary tot he
                            provisions of the organic law in passing this measure. I undertake to
                            say that the compromises of the Constitution have all been religiously
                            kept by the Government of the United States. 
                        I say, sir, without fear of contradiction that the party to which I
                            belong, which elevated Abraham Lincoln to power, did keep those
                            compromises, and not until the traitors of the South raised their
                            parricidal hands against the fair fabric which our fathers built, were
                            those compromises weakened or infringed upon.--But, sir, let us go back
                            to first principles, when the Mayflower moored upon the rock-bound shore
                            of Plymouth, bringing those who were fleeing from the despotism of old
                            England to plant here the gem of civil and religious liberty.
                        
                        Let us go back to the immortal Declaration of Independence, wherein are
                            enunciated the principles that all men are entitled to life, liberty,
                            and the pursuit of happiness.
                        Let us pass down from that to the Ordinance of 1787, which gave this
                            great Northwest to freedom, out of which has been erected three great
                            and glorious States, of which gallant Indiana is one. It is unnecessary
                            for me to tell gentlemen here that the Declaration of Independence and
                            the Ordinance of 1787 preceded the formation of the Constitution of the
                            United States.
                        Let us return to the consideration of that Constitution. I have carefully
                            examined it,and nothing in it save the clause for the rendition of
                            fugitive slaves upon which gentlemen here can base their talk about
                            vested rights, and their assertions that Congress has no right to
                            interfere ia this matter, or that the Legislature should not ratify this
                            proposed amendment.
                        I say that, though slavery was tolerated by the Constitution,
                            nevertheless the fathers of the Republic set their faces against it:
                            that they were opposed to the institution, and gave utterance to that
                            opposition prior to the adoption of the Constitution. They found the
                            Colonies with slavery existing in them and tolerated it sanctioned it
                            for the time being, looking to its ultimate extinction.
                        Notwithstanding twelve of the thirteen original States, as the gentleman
                            from Shelby says, were slaveholding, seven of them long since abolished
                            the institution, thus demonstrating that the moral sentiment of the
                            country was in opposition to this great wrong, this stain upon our
                            national escutcheon.
                        Gentlemen speak of the irrepressible conflict as if it
                            was the purpose of Abraham Lincoln and those who elected him, to make
                            war upon the institutions of the South. It was but the expression of
                            prophecy.
                        This irrepressible conflict had been going on from the inception of the
                            Government.
                        The moral sense of the country was in opposition to the institution of
                            slavery. Truth had been combating error, right had been struggling with
                            wrong, until the power which was based upon slavery had begun to wane,
                            and justice was triumphing. Then the compromise of 1820, upon the
                            admission of Missouri, became necessary to uphold the fading fortunes of
                            slavery, and the country torn by dissention and almost disrupted,
                            rendered, apparently, another compromise necessary in 1860 to satisfy
                            the demands of slavery. Slavery was continually asking for new
                            guarantees to uphold it. The annexation of Texas was for the purpose of
                            complying with that demand, to fortify and uphold a system that had in
                            itself no merit, and which was continually receding before the force of
                            public opinion. Not content with this the slaveholding power was intent
                            upon extending its area, and they farmed the design of making Kansas a
                            slave State, and transferred the irrepressible conflict to the
                            territories. But, thank God, the Border Ruffians of Missouri, who were
                            bent upon this, had to succumb, and instead of making a slave State of
                            Kansas, as they designed, Missouri has become a free State.
                        But this irrepressible conflict still raged, and farther guarantees were
                            demanded until we sent, in 1861, Peace Commissioners to Washington, and
                            then it was found that these opposing sentiments and influences could no
                            more commingle than oil and water.
                        One gentleman has alluded to Maryland.--Mr. Chairman, I am a native of
                            that State, and I can say with more than ordinary pride now, in the
                            language of song, ''Maryland, my Maryland," and I feel, sir, that it is
                            a privilege upon this floor to return to her my heartfelt thanks for
                            having emancipated herself from the withering blight of this
                            institution, and assist in wiping this fool blot from our national
                            esutcheon.
                        I stood upon her soil, sir, last winter; I visited the old school house
                            where I began my education; I looked upon her blue mountains; I said to
                            myself then, sir, that if she would but rid herself from the blight of
                            slavery that I could lay my bones in her soil and repose more quietly in
                            my grave there than upon any other spot of earth in the Universe.
                        I mingled with her citizens, I talked to her slaveholding population, and
                            the loyal Union men of that State who owned slaves frankly acknowledged
                            that, either the Government rungs perish and slavery survive or slavery
                            perish and the Government continue: both could not.
                        I may speak more warmly upon this subject than some gentlemen have. I was
                            raised to manhood amongst the pretended beauties of that institution,
                            and when I represent to you Mr. Chairman, how the Union man of the South
                            is willing to part with his slave rather than his Government; when
                            Maryland and Missouri by fores of their own convictions of right have
                            freed themselves from the curse, I do not understand how any man in free
                            Indiana, who knows nothing of the institution, only as he gets it
                            second-handed, can be an apologist for or seek to extenuate its
                            enormities or hesitate to lay violent hands upon the monster and
                            strangle it, by ratifying this amendment. Gentlemen talk about
                            Democracy, let me give them the language of the father of Democracy,
                            Thomas Jefferson. They profess to revere his name and be governed by his
                            principles. Hear him on the slave question:"

                        
                            The abolition of domestic slavery is the greatest
                                object of desire in these Colonies, where it was unhappily
                                introduced in their infant state."
                        
                        Let them listen to the words of another great Democratic light, James
                            Monroe, upon this subject:

                        
                            "We have found that this evil (slavery) has preyed
                                upon the very vitals of the Union, and has been prejudicial to all
                                the States in which it has existed."
                        
                        But better than those, the language of one who was a slaveholder and
                            fully conversant with the institution, of the man who said he would
                            rather be right than be President, whose I like we will not look again
                            upon very soon: the words of Henry Clay of Kentucky:
                        "So long as God allows the vital current to flow through my veins, I will
                            never, never, never, by word or thought, by mind or will aid in
                            submitting one road of free territory to the everlasting curse of human
                            bondage."
                        
                        Mr. Chairman, these are the testimonies of slaveholders themselves-and I
                            shall not quote that of Northern men upon the subject.
                        Well, passing down through the history of this irrepressible conflict, we
                            come to the year 1861, and we find the slave power losing its control of
                            the Government, and as their last resort they stab at the vitals of the
                            nation and attempt to tear down this fair temple of civil and religious
                            liberty.
                        The Government in the exercise of its duty meets them with force of arms;
                            and whenever our soldiers go forward to crush rebellion, they invariably
                            find that they have to fight slavery also, which is used as a means of
                            sustenance to those who are raising a parricidal hand against their
                            country. I cannot, Mr. Chairman appreciate the argument of the gentleman
                            from Cass, who thinks that rebels may have rights so far as this
                            institution is concerned.
                        Rebels have no rights under the Constitution they have trampled upon,
                            except the right to be tried, convicted and punished for their crimes.
                            Gentlemen talk of right, and of property. Sir, no man has any moral
                            right to hold another in bondage, though I admit that under the
                            compromises of the Constitution prior to the rebellion, the political
                            right of slavery was admitted and observed by my own party. In the
                            language of Cowper:
                        
                            "They found them slaves, but who the title gave,
                                The God of nature never formed a slave."
                        
                        Gentlemen talk flippantly against the Emancipation Proclamation.
                            Posterity will place the name of Abraham Lincoln second only to that of
                            George Washington, and posterity will accord to the men of this
                            Legislature who vote for this amendment to the Constitution, a more
                            honorable place in history than for any other vote they can possibly
                            give. I feel it a duty and a privilege to vote for this amendment, and
                            though I may have no influence over my Democratic friends on this floor,
                            I appeal to them to stand with as upon this matter, and at least let us
                            have the satisfaction of knowing that we have followed the golden rule
                            by doing unto others as we would that they should do unto us.
                        Mr. DUNHAM regretted exceedingly that his physical health would not
                            permit him to do this great subject justice. In his judgment this was
                            the most important question which had ever devolved upon the American
                            people. To solve it, it required all the intellect of eur minds and all
                            the patriotism of our hearts. He had lamented to see, listening to this
                            discussion, personal and malignant strife urged by gentlemen on the
                            other side. They had even charged those who differed with them on this
                            question with rebel sympathizing-with disloyalty. They were charged with
                            this simply because they exercised the God-given liberty of thought, and
                            proposed to act conscientiously as their reason and judgment
                            dictated.
                        Some had gone so far as to affirm that no man could be loyal and approve
                            this amendment. Should we ignore the dictates of reason and judgment,
                            and crash the freedom of thought? These were the moot distinguished and
                            dignified characteristics of humanity. The freedom of thought and speech
                            was fundamental in our Government. All men stood under this government
                            with a duty on them to exercise in all public transactions, their best
                            judgment and act accordingly. Then let gentlemen wake up to the fact
                            that Democrats are men as you are, and let us hold council together as
                            brothers-not bitter, but sweet counsel-to ascertain and to do our public
                            duty.
                        Scarcely a single gentleman on the other side who had spoken on. this
                            amendment, but had charged the minority, because they had opposed it,
                            with being advocates of slavery, There was not one word of truth in it.
                            The heart of every member of the minority en this floor was animated
                            with the spirit of liberty.
                        Born in a free State, all his sympathies were against slavery. Jefferson
                            so felt in his heart and judgment, yet he said he had no right to lay
                            his hand on the tower of free government to compel men to adopt his
                            views. The gentlemen here quoted Jefferson as the devil quotes scripture
                            they leave out what does not suit them. He hoped to hear no more about
                            our standing here as apologists for slavery. The great principle of
                            Human liberty and human dignity was priceless, and should be preserved
                            at any sacrifice. He glanced to the consistency of the gentleman from
                            Jefferson [Mr. Wright] four years ago voting for John C. Breckenridge,
                            and to-day cheek by jowl with Republicans, and while he had not changed.
                            He might see plain enough how that might be, but. he could not see how
                            the devil all those Republicans got along side of him, and he never
                            changing from his position when he voted for Breckenridge. He [Mr.
                            Dunham,] had heard Republicans say that four years ago the gentleman
                            from Jefferson was the most pliant tool Jesse Bright ever had. The
                            gentleman went so far on the Breckinridge side that like a pendulum of a
                            clock he had swung clear to the other side and now voted-this iron clad
                            Democrat-and acted cheek by jowl with Branham.
                        But gentlemen say that our words here encourage traitors. We oppose this
                            proposition and the present war policy, not that to the rebellion, but
                            because we want to put it down, and want a policy that will put it down.
                            Did gentlemen think Democrats could not appreciate the destiny of this
                            country?--could not take into their minds the great idea, a comment over
                            whose glad plains the two oceans clap their hands in an ecstacy of
                            praise to the Supreme. Talking about loyalty, did gentlemen know what
                            loyalty is? Loyalty is fidelity to the governing power. The officials of
                            this country were with the governing power, and the public officer that
                            grasps at and exercises powers not empowered by the people is a
                            usurper--a traitor--a disloyal man. A clause in the Declaratian of
                            Independence which says "all men are created free and equal,'' was an
                            expression of the determination of our fathers to be rid of all
                            aristocratic domination. Our fathers counted the nigger out. 
                        They did not agree with Ben Butler, when he said the other day that "they
                            are of us." With reference to State Sovereignty, it was a sufficient
                            reply to the sneer of the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Wright) against
                            State sovereignty, to say that those attributes of soveriegnty which he
                            enumerated as delegates to the General Government, were delegated by  sovereign States. The power of
                            amendment of the Constitution was confined in its exercise to the charge
                            of principles not delegated not radical fundamental. The majority now
                            sought to change the Constitution of that Union as our fathers made it
                            you sought to furl and trail the glorious flag under which, from the
                            Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the St. Lawrence to the Darien's
                            isthmus, we had achieved all our glories. God Almighty had formed this
                            country for one people. Look at mountains and its rivers; its praries
                            and its forests! What God had joined together no a could put asunder.
                            Loyalty! That sentiment did not come from our noble Governor. It did not
                            come from Presidents, Congresses, or any magnates. Great God! The
                            Governor was not our master. From the President of the United States
                            down to the lackey that blacked boots, all were servants of the
                            people.
                        He challenged the learned gentleman that had followed him, to show one
                            syllable of the delegation that power to Congress.
                        The power of amendment contained in the Constitution extended only to the
                            powers and principles already incorporated in that instrument. He did
                            not care whether you had one tyrant or thirty or a hundred thousand.
                            Liberty was where the whole people promiscuously, through each other,
                            made their own laws and institutions.
                        Tyranny was where one set of men, not chosen by the other set, made laws
                            for the whole. Therefore, if three-fourths of the States undertook to
                            control the other fourth, it is tyranny. If three-fourths of the States,
                            in regard to this amendment, trampled upon the rights of the other
                            fourth, they not simply violated the Constitution, but they were guilty
                            of absolute tyranny.
                        He had been of those who had been sanguine of the long existence (quoting
                            from Jefferson) of our federal Union. Now he doubted It much, and saw
                            the event not far distant, This question (of slavery) like a fire bell
                            in the night, had awakened him and filled him with alarm.
                        New England puritanism had struck this bell, and filled the country with
                            terror, solely for the purpose of obtaining sectional and political
                            power.
                        He read from Mr. Jefferson's letters, by way of special enlightenment of
                            the gentleman from Lawrence (Mr. Boyd), Jefferson would be rid of
                            slavery "by expatriation.'' Was this the Jeffersonianism of Republicans
                            in this Hall? The President-Father Abraham-it was boasted by a
                            Republican newspaper, took a negro into his carriage, whilst his white
                            servant was riding outside, and Charles Sumner took a negro into the
                            Supreme Court of the United States, and caused him to be admitted as a
                            practicing lawyer, in the place where once stood Daniel Webster ! He
                            further illustrated this Republican Jeffersonianism. He read copiously
                            from a late speech by Major General Butler, closing with a
                            recommendation to make the negro, who is among us and of us, equal with
                            us before the law.
                        Mr. D. pursued his theme, and demonstrated that it was the purpose of the
                            party advocating this amendment, to elevate the negro to the proud
                            position of an American citizen. How are the mighty fallen, when Sambo
                            gets up and exclaims, " I, too, am an American citizen." Jefferson had
                            said that he was willing to abolish slavery provided he could have
                            expatriation of the African-a separation of the races and the
                            preservation of the proud Caucasian from contamination. Where two races
                            live together, one must be held in subjection, or the inferior must be
                            absorbed by the superior.
                        Herein, also, was the reason why he opposed this amendment He opposed it,
                            also, because of its certainly damaging effects on the interests of the
                            laborers of the country, which he showed at length. Was the laborer of
                            Indiana willing to start out to make his pathway in life alongside with
                            a negro ? Labor was dignified according to the population that performed
                            it. That labor must be performed, but it should be performed by men who
                            dignified it and made it honorable.
                        He was not for impairing the old Constitution in any particular. He was
                            for compelling the rebels to come back and live under it. It was for
                            this that he had entered into the war. For this he had made speeches and
                            spent dollars, ten to one made and spent by his republican friends, to
                            raise men for the army. And yet these good looking men insinuated
                            disloyalty against him.
                        This amendment struck at the loyal slave States-Delaware, Kentucky,
                            Arkansas-as well as the slave States in rebellion.
                        And, finally, he opposed the amendment because of its effects on the war.
                            When we make a new Constitution we make a new Union, (for the
                            Constitution makes the Union), we lose the dignity of the issue upon
                            which the war was opened. He scouted the taunts against his loyalty and
                            about his sympathy with the rebellion, by his readiness to compare
                            records with the best of his traducers, in speeches for recruits, in
                            money spent for recruits, in acts of devotion to his country, in the
                            privations and loneliness of the tent and on the field of bloody strife.
                            Patriotism was cheap when it could be acceptably vaunted in empty breath
                            by men who staid at home. Its effects on the war would be the reverse of
                            that policy which would build up a Union party in the South. Such would
                            be his war policy, though not a military man. He would build up a Union
                            party there, and lay about the armed forces of the rebellion with all
                            the military power of the country. He animadverted generally on the
                            partizin spirit that denounces disloyalty against a man, because he will
                            think and speak freely; also, on what he had seen of a disposition to
                            deride and laugh at the Union, in the Abolition leaders, from Horace
                            Greeley and Father Giddings and Thadeus Stevens down.
                        Mr. D. concluded, declaring that although he might disapprove of the
                            policy, he would sustain the administration in all its efforts to
                            maintain the national territorial integrity. The reason he opposed the
                            present policy was because he did not think it the best to restore
                            Union. Every step you take in this slavery question robbed you of moral
                            power and left you only with the physical. He would consent to no
                            dissolution of this Union. But to ac-  country. He animadverted generally on the
                            partizan spirit that denounces disloyalty against a man, because he will
                            think and speak freely; also, on what he bad seen of a disposition to
                            deride and laugh at the Union, in the Abolition leaders, from Horace
                            Greeley and Father Giddings and Thadeus Stevens down.
                        Mr. D. concluded, declaring that although he might disapprove of the
                            policy, he would sustain the administration in all its efforts to
                            maintain, the national territorial integrity. The reason he opposed the
                            present policy was because be did not think it the best to restore
                            Union. Every step you take in this slavery question robbed you of moral
                            power and left you only with the physical. He would consent to no
                            dissolution of this Union. But to accomplish union we might let this
                            negro question rest, fix our eyes upon the flag of our country, and bear
                            it forth in the maintenance of the Constitution.
                        Mr. SHUEY opened with a motion that Mr. Speaker Pettit would address the
                            committee to-night. He responded to admonitions about Republican
                            intolerance, by reference to the denunciations of his party by Mr.
                            Brown-that Democrats were not Constitution-breakers and perjured persons
                            as the Republicans.
                         Mr. BROWN disclaimed alleging perjury.
                        Mr. SHUEY explained that a Constitution breaker here was a perjured man.
                            He treated the equity of this question. He magnified the Constitution
                            which gives protection to the property and person of every man that
                            treads the soil- negroes included. He gave-Democratic authority, which
                            gave the full measure of civil right to negroes by way of offsetting the
                            reference to the speech of General Butler.
                        He was opposed to slavery for its fruits. He-showed that all the Southern
                            lights of the Democracy had lead the rebellion. Their roll of names in
                            the rebel Congress was little beside what might seem the roll of names
                            of a Democratic caucus. He spoke at length of the evils of slavery. To
                            the argument that three-fourths could not carry the amended
                            Constitution-the new Constitution-over the dissenting one-fourth,-he
                            replied, that that fourth had consented to the modification, in the
                            ratification they gave to the original Constitution. He deprecated that
                            Democratic opposition to the policy of the war, which descended,
                            sometimes, beneath the common love of country and loyalty that should
                            animate every American heart,-referring particularly to the declaration
                            of Mr. Ristine, in his letter to Mr. Voorhees, that his "only hope was
                            in the successful resistance of the South. If they do not succeed, woe
                            betide us who have opposed the policy of this Administration." He
                            defined the word loyalty; and thence he showed, that disobedience to the
                            servants of the people appointed to carry out their will was
                            disloyalty.
                        Opposition to the administration was disloyalty, because the
                            administration was the chosen instrument of the people to carry out
                            their will. To refuse implicit obedience to the Commander-in-Chief of
                            the army and navy was to be not so good a citizen as a man ought to be.
                            He concluded by a catalogue of the outgrowths of treason from the
                            Democratic party.
                        When he had concluded-
                        On motion by Mr. WOODS, the committee rose, and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to sit again
                            on the same matter, this evening at 7 o'clock.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion by Mr. RHOADS, an evening session at 7 o'clock was ordered.
                        On motion by Mr. SABIN, Mr. Beckett had leave of absence till
                            Tuesday.
                        On motion of Mr. TRUSLER, the Military Committee was
                            authorised to employ a clerk.
                        On his farther motion, Mr. Foulke was added to the Military
                                Committee.
                        On motion of Mr. ABBETT, Mr. Richardson obtained indefinite leave of
                            absence-sick,
                        And then-at 5.20 P. M.-
                        On motion of Mr. HOGATE, the House took a recess till 7 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the House again resolved into
                                Committee of the Whole-Mr. Henricks in the
                            Chair-and took up again the consideration of Mr. Whiteside's joint
                            resolution, No. 13, for ratification of amendments of the Constitution
                            of the United States, proposed by the Congress thereof, and the
                            Executive Message in relation thereto.
                        Mr. HUMPHREYS proposed to submit the considerations which should govern
                            his vote. The proposition would pass, doubtless, but its friends were
                            welcomed to the credit of it. Hs regarded this as a part of the old
                            issue, which dates back before the war of the Revolution. It was, the
                            opposition to free democratic government in this country. But whenever
                            that party had gained the ascendency their principle and policy of
                            admistration were soon found to bs inimical to her government, and had
                            to give place. He traced the history of those political organizations of
                            various names the friends of a stronger Government and opposers of the
                            Democracy down to the organization of the Republican party in 1856, This
                            was the year when, for the first time, sectional candidates were on for
                            President and Vice President of the United States. He regarded the negro
                            in this issue only the pretext, which had been used adroitly to get this
                            strong Government party in power. And they were now using the war power
                            to strengthen their hands and enlarge the central power. That was
                            immediate effect of this amendment. It a blow at the rights of the
                            States.
                        Upon just as reasonable a pretext they might amend the Constitution by
                            striking down State Courts and the State Legislatures. He would not
                            discuss the question of slavery in its details. It was but a pretext of
                            the now in the administration of this Government, for the ulterior
                            purpose of establishing as central Government. He argued not the
                            unconstitutionality of the proposition farther than to allege that it
                            was not an amendment in in harmony with the spirit of the original
                            instrument. It was a proposition, looking to a radical change of that
                            fundamental principle, that all just Governments exists by the consent
                            of the governed. The policy of the party in power, had been leading us
                            toward centralization step by  step
                            until even this radical proposition is received all over the country
                            with demonstrations of popular favor.
                        Mr. SIM was proud of the opportunity of a making a for himself on this
                            question. Since the war commenced he had cast aside all party ties, and
                            held the lamented Douglas, that in time of war, there could be but two
                            parties-patriots and traitors. He did not say Democrats were traitors.
                            They were all well regarded by him as well for their patriotic
                            sentiments and acts of patriotic devotion, as for their admirable social
                            qualities.- But if he tread on their toes, gentlemen should not have
                            corns. Her regarded slavery as a blight on our institutions. He traced
                            its arrogant demands and encroachments on the administration of the
                            General Government., till its sectional candidate for President was
                            fairly beaten, and then it raised its hand for the destruction of the
                            best Government on earth. Then he with millions of others, forgot their
                            partisan designations, took up arms and made common cause for the
                            defense of the old Government.
                        But still for two years of the war we dallied with slavery, and kept
                            guard over its interests, whilst the great cause of the Government was
                            even losing ground under the lead of such men as General Halleck,
                            General Buell, and General McClellan. But, thank God, he himself had no
                            hand in this dallying. His heart yearned for the change of policy, which
                            was at last forced upon the country by considerations of what is called
                            military necessity. The knife was the proper remedy for this blight of
                            slavery, and be saw its efficient, and, to him, most wholesome operation
                            in the ratification of the proposed amendment of the Constitution of the
                            United States.
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK said he was one of the oldest citizens of the State. A
                            native of Kentucky, he had lived in the State of Indiana since 1811. He
                            opposed the principle of this amendment not so much because of his
                            dislike of it per se, but because such a proposition as this was only
                            befitting calmer times. He disclaimed all sympathy and friendliness for
                            slavery. This constitutional amendment would no more liberate the slaves
                            than Mr. Lincoln's proclamation. Neither slavery nor honorable peace
                            could be conquered but by the sword, and by negotiation upon equal and
                            honorable terms. He deprecated the policy of the Republican party, which
                            had stopped up every avenue to peace about the beginning of the
                            conflict. And he charged upon that party and their insidious operations
                            through the churches the responsibility of the war. He charged it upon
                            them in the beginning of their organizations of parties in this country
                            in their subserviency to the deviltries of old England, and in their
                            sectional and fanatical legislation hostile to the fugitive slave law.
                            He charged upon them the responsibility for dividing the North, and for
                            all our political dissensions which, to some extent, had kept recruits
                            out of the army.
                        Mr. Speaker PETTIT. He accorded heartily the sentiment of the gentleman
                            from Floyd (Mr. Dunham) as to the gravity and importance of the matter
                            under consideration. That subject stripped of its verbiage, was simply
                            not to do violence to any one, but to express the State's ratification
                            of these words of Congress: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
                            except for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall
                            be tolerated in the United States nor in any place within its
                            jurisdiction forever." He considered the mode of amendment of the
                            Constitution of the United States presented here by the Constitution. It
                            was a plain, easy, just method of rectifying recurring evils. It was
                            here, simply proposing to us, as representatives to give the assent of
                            the people to this amendment, to make freedom national, not
                            sectional.
                        This assent was submitted to us by the words of Jefferson himself. The
                            soil of these Northwestern States Were made free by these very words.
                            And he glanced at the civilized and material prosperity of these States,
                            and asked if, in view of this unprecedented prosperity, the
                            representatives of the State of Indiana should refuse the assent of
                            their, constituents to the incorporation of those words in the organic
                            law of the nation. He confessed at an honest surprise that the voice of
                            a singles man should be raised against it. He proceeded to consider the
                            question whether we have the power to make this amendment, and if so,
                            whether it is politic to use it.
                         Subordinate to these questions, he reviewed the pending debate on this
                            floor, which was opened by the gentleman from Monroe and continued in
                            opposition by the gentleman from Sullivan and the gentleman from
                            Jackson, the gentleman from Floyd and others. To the argument that this
                            amendment would tend to the consolidation of governmental powers, he
                            submitted the question whether it took away any power or any right from
                            a State by her becoming fear? There was no absorption of power by the
                            Congress in this amendment. The Congress was merely preparing an
                            amendment, not giving it vitality. According to the argument of
                            gentlemen, this amendment would be giving-up certain of our reserved
                            rights. He considered the question whether we have the right to do so,
                            submitting affirmative conclusions.
                        The loose objection that this proposed action is not Constitutional
                            meant, he supposed, was not competent to put into the Constitution by
                            way of amendment what is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. In
                            opposition to this objection, he showed at length, that where there is a
                            general grant of power, with no limitation upon it, it includes every
                            thing under it. Had he stated the objection correctly ?
                        Mr. BROWN. He put it on the ground that sovereignty begins with the
                            States. Amendments must be subordinate to the delegated powers.
                            Jefferson and Madison held that the Federal Government had no right to
                            interfere with slavery. He had therefore, submitted, that this amendment
                            could not be applied.
                        Mr. PETTIT. The Constitution unamended does not confer the power.
                        Mr. BROWN. We can only amend in so far as the Constitution invites
                            amendments. Can we amend the Constitution so as to fasten slavery on the
                            State of Indiana? If not, how can you exclude it from Kentucky by
                            amendment?
                        
                        Mr. PETTIT. Ratifying this amendment then, we simply part with a reserved
                            power We treat with what belongs to us so far, let it be conceded for
                            argument, we add to the powers of the General Government. But he read
                            again from the constitutional provisions for amendment in the 5th and
                            1st articles. "Except upon those two subjects this clause confers upon
                            Congress plenary power to propose amendments. The very contrary of the
                            gentleman's restriction was in the Constitution; if he would undertake
                            it. He glanced at the significant fact that the word "slave" is not in
                            the Constitution, and quoted the language of Madison thereupon. He went
                            into the convention that framed the Constitution.
                        He accepted the invitation of the gentleman from Floyd, to find out the
                            meaning of the Constitution by contemporaneous expositions. And he went
                            into these inquiries at some length, reading from the Constitution, the
                            convention debate, the ordinance of 1787, the acts of the first Congress
                            .under the Constitution, the act of Congress, enabling the Territory of
                            Indiana to form a Constitution and State Government-showing fully that
                            Congress has exercised powers affecting the status-the state of citizens
                            of the States-there were continuous instances wherein Congress had
                            asserted its authority over the domestic institutions of the States,
                            South as well as North, down to the time of the famous declaration of
                            Mr. Polk with reference to the Oregon act, in the year 1847. The spirit
                            of Democratic political discussions was false to history on this
                            subject. It was not the Democracy of Jefferson. It was wrong for
                            gentleman to swear by the honored name of Jefferson, whilst they denied
                            his faith. It was not the democracy of Jefferson and Jackson, but the
                            democracy of Secession, built on the name of Jackson.
                         He traced the sad history of political slavery through the years of
                            political humiliations of the North, beginning with the two-thirds rule
                            in the Democratic Presidential Conventions, and culminating in the
                            fulfilment of the prediction of Jackson, that nullification would seek a
                            pretext in slavery for the dismemberment of the Union. And, there having
                            been an abandonment by this institution of every claim upon our
                            clemency, the time had come for us to stamp it with the most forcible
                            approbation by ratifying the proposed amendment of the Constitution. And
                            beyond this question of policy there rises a higher question of
                            duty.
                        He spoke at length, giving numerous considerations, which want of tspace
                            excludes farther reports.
                        When he had concluded-
                        Mr. BUSKIRK made an ineffectual motion that the Committee rise, report
                            progress, and ask leave to sit again at 9 o'clock to-morrow.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the Committee rose, and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported the message and the joint resolution to the House
                            without amendment.
                         And then-at 10:25 P. M.-
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, the House adjourned till to-morrow morning at 9
                            o'clock. 
                    
                

                

                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        SATURDAY, February 11, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    Messrs. FINCH and MARSHALL obtained leave to record their votes on the
                        passage yesterday evening of the joint resolution [S. 16,] proposing to ratify the
                        amendment to the Constitution of the United States, recently submitted by
                        Congress to the Legislatures of the several States for their
                        concurrence.

                    
                        LEAVES OF ABSENCE
                        Were obtained for Mr. Gaff till Monday, and for Mr. Mason for the residue
                            of next week after Monday.
                    

                    
                        CLERK FOR THE PRESIDING OFFICER.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the Lieutenant Governor was authorized to
                            appoint a clerk to keep his accounts.
                    
                    
                        DESTRUCTION OF STATE BONDS.
                        The Committee on Finance reported the burning of three
                            hundred and nine thousand and fifteen hundred dollars of Indiana War
                            Bonds of 1861. The report was kid on the table.
                    
                    
                        TOWNSHIP BONDS.
                        Mr. NILES presented a petition from James Bradley, Andrew L. Osborn, and
                            other citizens of Laporte county, praying that townships may be
                            empowered to issue bonds for the purpose of raising money to pay
                            bounties to volunteers.
                        Mr. NILES remarked that the petitioners were gentlemen of the highest
                            character, but frankness on his part required him to state he doubted
                            the wisdom of the measure proposed. Under it the country might become
                            heavily burthened with debt. The bonds would be largely depreciated in
                            the market and the future growth and prosperity of the State might be
                            seriously retarded. One other hard feature of the scheme is that we
                            should by such a measure heavily tax all the young men of the army who
                            have volunteered without bounties. 
                        The petition was referred to the Committee on Military
                                Affairs.
                    
                    
                        THE PROTECTION OF FISH.
                        Mr. NILES presented the petition of D. J. Woodward, W. H. Weir, A.
                            Teegardan, Ed. Vail, E. G. Hamilton, A. L. Osborn and other citizens of
                            Laporte county, praying for a law prohibiting the destructive and
                            unsportsmanlike practice of shooting fish in inland lakes and ponds
                            during the time of spawning. 
                        He remarked that, while in Europe great efforts were made to propagate
                            fish in the inland waters, ours were being recklessly destroyed and
                            action by the Legislature on the subject required.
                        The petition was referred Committee to the on the Rights and
                                Privileges of the inhabitants of this State.
                    
                    
                        TERRE HAUTE AND RICHMOND RAILROAD.
                        
                        

                        On motion of Mr. HANNA, the bill [S.
                                68] change the name of the Terre Haute Richmond Railroad to
                            the Indianapolis and Terre Haute Railroad, and giving further time to
                            complete their road to the State line, read the third time and finally passed by
                            yeas 42 nays 0.

                    
                    
                        RECESS TILL MONDAY.
                        Leave being granted, Mr. CARSON offered the following, which was adopted
                            by consent:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn, it
                                        adjourn until Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
                                
                            
                        
                    

                    
                         INMATES OF THE STATE ASYLUMS.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Hamilton, from the Committee on Benevolent
                                Institutions, returned the bill [S. 110] to provide for the
                            clothing and other personal expenses of the pupils of the Benevolent
                            Institutions of the State, to provide for the manner of their removal to
                            and from said Institutions in certain cases therein specified, and the
                            manner of certifying the expenses therefor, with a report recommending
                            its passage. 
                        The report was concurred in.
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, of Hamilton, the bill was read the second
                            time.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. TERRY, the constitutional restriction was dispensed with
                            and the bill was considered as engrossed, read the third time, and
                            finally passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 0.
                        Pending the vote, Mr. WRIGHT said he left the Senator from White [Mr.
                            Woods] in bed that the Senator could not be here to-day.
                        Mr. CORBIN from the same committee, returned a similar bill [S. 97]
                            recommending that it lie on the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                         PAY OF DOORKEEPERS AND PAGES.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the vote on referring a resolution and pending
                            amendments (See page 31 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) concerning
                            the pay of doorkeepers and pages to a special committee was
                            reconsidered.
                        Mr. COBB withdrew his amendment.
                        Mr. DUNNING moved to farther amend by inserting the following names as
                            employees to be paid under said resolution, viz:

                            Richards.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        The resolution as amended was then adopted by consent.
                    

                    
                        EMPLOYEES OF THE SENATE.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

                                        duties discharged by each of said assistants.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        SOUTHERN PENITENTIARY.
                        Mr. ALLISON asked and obtained leave of absence for the committee thereon
                            to visit the State's Prison at Jeffersonville, next Tuesday week.
                    
                    
                         NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        By Mr. COBB, [S. 158] in relation
                            the sale of real estate at private sale by executors, administrators and
                            guardians in certain cases.
                        By Mr. THOMPSON, [S. 159 ] to provide for the erection and maintenance cf
                            Houses of Refuge or Schools of Reform by counties and cities and the
                            employment therein of certain persons.
                        By Mr. NILES. [S. 160,] ratifying the action of the Governor in procuring
                            an advance of $250,000 from the President of the United States for the
                            preparation of troops for the service of the United States, and for the
                            defense of the State, and directing him to pay the unexpended balance
                            thereof into the treasury, and to account therefor with the portion
                            expended to the President of the United States as an allowance to the
                            State.
                    
                    
                        DESTRUCTION OF COUNTY RECORDS.
                        On motion by Mr. CASON the bill [S.
                                150,] for the benefit of Jasper county (introduced day before
                            yesterday) was read by title and referred to the  Committee on
                                the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        SPEECHES NEXT FRIDAY.
                        Mr. MOORE. I move to reconsider the vote of yesterday afternoon, adopting
                            the resolution [Mr. Oyler's] giving the privilege to Democratic
                            Senators, if they see proper, to make a speech next Friday. I think it
                            is a gross insult to every Democratic Senator here, though I don't
                            suppose the Senator who introduced it intended anything by it.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, (interposing ) The joint resolution, [S. 16,] is imperfect, and will
                            require amendment by the House, which will bring it back to this body
                            for concurrence, and therefore Senators will not probably avail
                            themselves of the special order, as they will have an opportunity for
                            discussion when the joint resolution comes back for concurrence.
                        Mr. MOORE. I take it, sir, as one Senator here, as a gross insult. What
                            is the proposition of that resolution? It proposes, after this measure
                            is passed, we can come in here and make a speech on it, if we will get
                            down on our knees and ask these gentlemen the majority, they call
                            themselves the privilege of doing so.
                         Mr. ALLISON (interrupting.) Did the gentleman vote for the resolution he
                            is denouncing? 
                        Mr. MOORE. I don't know. But after thinking about this thing all night,
                            this morning I feel myself very much insulted indeed. I have a right to
                            get up and give my opinions on this matter without being humiliated to
                            ask the privilege. When these Senators had said all they desired to say,
                            then they passed the gag law, and after one promise after another that
                            all should speak who wanted to. And I was astonished at my old friend
                            from Monroe [Mr. Dunning] that he would sustain that gag law after
                            making the promise that every man should have the privilege of saying
                            what he desired to say. I have long lived with that old friend, and have
                            rejoiced many times to call him my friend. We have been together here
                            for the past thirty years, off and on, and I believe we have been trying
                            to favor the true interests of Indiana. I recollect when we were here in
                            the boisterous session of 1836, and he recollects it well too. Every
                            man, almost, in the State of Indiana was run mad on this grand system of
                            internal improvements; and it puts me in mind of the present session. At that time they did not stop for
                            anything.
                        If a man made a motion not in accordance with the majority's wish, he was
                            put down forthwith. The day that bill was introduced from the
                            committee-I, was on it-every man had to pledge himself to go for that
                            bill just as it came from the committee. I didn't, but if he didn't, if
                            he had a point in it, he was to be stricken out. I opposed it. I voted
                            for every amendment, and I opposed this grand scheme from A to izzard,
                            till I came to the final passage, when I was instructed. I don't believe
                            there were one hundred men of my constituents but what wanted the bill
                            passed, and a great many of them believed it would make them rich. On
                            the final passage I voted for that bill, and that was the worst vote I
                            ever gave, and I said so at the time; but a large portion of the people
                            of my county desired me to give it.
                        Now here comes up '65, and it seems to me these men don't stop at
                            anything, and I am sorry to say it. It seems to me that every single
                            measure that cornea up here-no difference about the justice of the
                            thing-they will carry it through, and if they can't get it through
                            fairly they will get it through anyhow.
                        But I have to say far the presiding officer, and I am glad I have got
                            that to say, that he has done justice to every member of this body; but
                            I can't say so much for some of these Senator?, and particularly my old
                            friend here, [laughter.] Now I think when that man comes to think of
                            this matter coolly-he is like myself, he gets into a passion pretty
                            quick, but as he said yesterday, he gets over it pretty quick and when
                            he thinks as to the manner be treats these Senators, I think his good
                            soul will say he done wrong; and that he would have taken this
                            resolution as an insult if he was in the minority, as he calls us. But I
                            don't think we are in the minority here. I think we can count
                            twenty-five to their twenty-five, and we have got equal rights here; and
                            it is for this reason, Mr. President, that I make this motion. I hope
                            there is not a Senator on the Democratic side who will condescend to
                            make a speech here by their permission. No, sir, we will claim our
                            rights, and if we can't get them properly we will submit.
                        My old friend said there was some understanding about this. I never
                            knowed it, and I didn't go either. Rather than to see this abominable
                            measure passed, I would have passed out; but at the proper time you
                            should have voted I would have broke a quorum enough to get these men
                            who wanted a chance to speak. After my worthy friend from Boone [Mr.
                            Cason,] had spit out all the spleen he was master of, and he ia master
                            of a good deal, and said all he could to-day to harrow up the feelings
                            of Democrats, and spoke till he spoke himself down, then they moved the
                            previous question.
                        I have not got much more to say. ["Go on, go on."] I want this resolution
                            to be reconsidered and stricken from the journal; and I hope to God not
                            a Senator of the Democratic party will descend so low as to ask, "If you
                            please, sir, just let me have a speech, alter this measure is
                            passed."
                         I believe the usual way is for a man who desires to say anything to say
                            it before a measure is passed and not afterward. I feel that I have not
                            had my rights although I am not a speaker and make no pretension. I am a
                            farmer and I am proud of it. I don't belong to those kind of men who are
                            always studying trickery [laughter,] and I am glad of it; though my
                            friends here say they are the most honest set of men on God's earth. It
                            is no harm to watch honest men, I believe. [Renewed laughter.] I say you
                            have to watch them or they will trick yon out of every right you
                            have.
                        I think the foundation was laid by this abominable thing yesterday for
                            centralizing this government, and doing away with State rights. And you
                            may look at this matter from the commencement, of this administration to
                            the present time, and they have taken step by step toward that. Look
                            when they abolished slavery in the District of Columbia. Then they
                            thought the people got ripe for it, and they introduced another measure.
                            Step by step they laid their hands on one of the greatest instruments
                            ever drawn up by man, next to the Bible. And this is only the
                            commencement. Then this great bank they have got established at
                            Washington City-all the brandies have to account there. Centralized
                            government-that is the object.
                        But I have said enough on this matter. As I said before, I don't pretend
                            to be a speaker, but I did pray yesterday that I had the ability of
                            Henry Clay or John Calhoun, so as to skin these boys. [Laughter.] And,
                            sir, if I had they would have heard from measure.
                        Mr. President, it has been my cousse in life to try and guard the rights
                            of the people. This is my last round, the session will soon be at a
                            close and I never expect to be here again. I hope to close this career
                            with the confidence reposed in me, which I have never betrayed, thank
                            God; go that the people will say '''well done, good ana faithful
                            servant." In good faith I make this motion to reconsider that resolution
                            and strike it from the journal.
                        Mr. OYLER was not willing to have his good acts evil spoken of, and
                            undertook to say that not a Senator on this floor, but the Senator from
                            Owen, [Mr. Moore,] misjudged his motives in introducing the resolution.
                            The resolution was offered out of good motives, and for the benefit of
                            Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators. The gentleman comes
                            here and manages to get in his speech, and then wants to exclude his
                            brother Democrats. Without attempting to influence the vote of any
                            Senator upon this motion, he insisted that if the resolution were
                            stricken from the files it would be an insult to him individually.
                         Mr. THOMPSON did not think there was any disposition to gag discussion
                            till the issue was made, and then none of us liked to take the
                            responsibility of letting the vote go over till next week. He thought
                            the resolution was harmless, supposing that no one would speak on Friday
                            any how.
                        Mr. COBB conceded to the senator introducing the resolution the purest
                            motives, as gentleman's course was commendable, except the vote
                            seconding the previous resolution.
                        Mr. GIFFORD was satisfied the resolution was not intended to give any
                            offense, and  should probably avail
                            himself of the opportunity for an explanation.
                        Mr CORBIN believed the motives of the senior from Johnson were good,
                            although the practical result might be construed as reflecting some
                            dishonor upon the democratic party.
                        Mr. McCLURG saw no necessity for reconsidering the vote. Every Senator
                            upon this floor knows the whole of the discussion made yesterday and the
                            day before was not for the purpose of changing a single vote. It was for
                            nothing else in the world than to give the reasons of the speakers for
                            the vote they would cast. And there is very little difference between
                            giving reasons before casting a vote, and giving reasons after the vote
                            is taken. The only difference is, those that have spoken gave the
                            reasons for the vote they were going to cast, and those that will speak
                            are to give the reasons for the vote they did cast.
                        Mr. MOORE. I made this motion in good faith, and desired it very much,
                            but as Senators seem to think their feelings are not wounded, if they
                            desire it to remain on the journal I can stand it as well as they, and I
                            will withdraw the motion. 
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                     The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed the reading
                        of the journal of yesterday.

                        BILLS INTRODUCED.

                            o'clock, P. M.

                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on County and Township Business.
                        Mr. HOWARD introduced a bill, [H. R. 162,] for an act supplemental to an

                            7, 1852-
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH introduced a bill [H. R. 163,] for an act erecting the 14th
                            Judicial Circuit, and fixing the times of holding the Courts

                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. COLOVER introduced a bill [H. R. 164 ] for an act to provide for

                            lines:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the

                            hands of rebels:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Federal Relations.
                    
                    
                        THE THIRTEENTH ARTICLE.
                        
                        Mr. HIGGINS introduced introduced a bill [H. R. 165 ] for an act to
                            enforce the 13th article of the Constitution, and to repeal the act
                            entitled "An act to enforce the 13th article of the Constitution,"
                            approved June 18, 1852:
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to reject the bill. He was willing that its
                            consideration be postponed, and that it be made a special order.
                        Mr. COLLINS demanded the special order.
                        The SPEAKER decided that the hour of 10 o'clock had not arrived.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK'S motion to postpone was rejected.
                        The question recurring on the motion to reject--
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved to lay the motion on the table. But the motion was not
                            entertained by the Chair--
                        Mr. HIGGINS having first obtained the floor. Mr. H. said it was, perhaps,
                            well known to every member on the floor that this 13th article was a
                            dead letter on the statute book.
                        Mr. COLLINS made the point, that the motion to lay on the table, could
                            not be entertained because the gentleman from Laporte had obtained the
                            floor.
                        The SPEAKER sustained the point of order.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. There was not a day in the year in which the legislation
                            under this provision of the Constitution was not violated. Nobody sought
                            to enforce it. He had heard of a very few instances in which laborers
                            had sought to enforce it. And it remains a dead letter on the statute
                            book and on the dockets of Justices of the Peace where fines have been
                            inflicted. For this reason he hoped the whole matter would be wiped
                            out.
                        Mr. BUSKlRK. This was a proposition to repeal the law for the enforcement
                            of the 13th article of the Constitution. He rehearsed the 13th article
                            including the section 4, requiring the Legislature to pass laws to carry
                            out the provision. When this Constitution was made in 1850, a separate
                            vote was taken on this 13th article, and it was adopted by a majority of
                            94,000 votes of the freemen of Indiana. A bill was introduced here to
                            report the existing law enacted in pursuance of this 4th section without
                            providing remedy. He asked members if they had forgotten the oath they
                            took to support the Constitution of the State of Indiana; If this
                            provision of the Constitution was wrong, let it be changed in the mode
                            pointed out by that instrument. But so long as it stands in the
                            fundamental law, every member is bound by that oath to support the
                            Constitution.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. The only alteration of the law was as to the stay of
                            execution without replevin and bail. Besides this, the law remains as
                            before. It was passed in 1852.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK called for the reading of the bill.
                        The Clerk read the bill again.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The first section provides a change as to one of the
                            provisions of the act of 1852; and then the last section repeals the
                            entire law. Why was the bill presented in this form? Was it supposed
                            that members would not observe the force of that clause? Why propose to
                            amend the first section? It was a proposition to wipe put the law of
                            1852, passed under a solemn injunction of the Constitution, and relieve
                            the State from this 13th article. He regretted to be compelled to move
                            to reject any bill introduced here; but he had a right to do so, and
                            because the Constitution requires the legislation proposed to be
                            repealed, he made the motion to reject.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB regarded the conscientious indignation of the gentleman from
                            Monroe as a sort of tempest in a teapot. The law of 1852 was never of
                            any more use than the fifth wheel to a coach. The constitution itself
                            provides the punishment for any violation of this provision. The act of
                            1852 was simply a reiteration of ethe constitution. The constitution
                            fixes the punishment, te supposed with this view, that if the law of
                            1852 were repealed, still the penalties for its violation would stand.
                            The constitution was the highest law, and he did not see the use or
                            legislation to render the constitution stronger.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK would ask the gentleman from Marion, as a lawyer and he knew
                            be was a good one whether the constitution is self-executing? whether
                            any provision of the constitution can be executed without a provision of
                            law?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB answered, as a man of common sense. It certainly can.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Could the gentleman give an example?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. He could find many examples in the decisions of the Supreme
                            Court, where laws have been held void because the constitution is the
                            highest authority. This was the only instance he knew of in any
                            constitution where the crime is defined and the punishment provided. He
                            could not see why the constitution should not be enforced as well as the
                            law.  We were in the habit of
                            saying the fundamental law is the highest. Therefore, he regarded the
                            law of 1852 as of no consequence.
                        Mr. BROWN. Would the gentleman be kind enough to explain the reason why
                            that other clause or the constitution was put in, making it imperative
                            to pass a law to carry it out?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB supposed it was adopted in order to require the Legislature
                            to make laws make it effectual. But certainly it, was not essential,
                            because the Constitution itself fixes the penalty. With reference to the
                            remark about institutional obligations, he would call the attention of
                            the gentleman from Monroe, to other provision just as imperative as
                            this. Under article four, section 4, it is prescribed, that ''the
                            General Assembly shall--every six years--cause an enumeration to be made
                            of the white male inhabitants over the age of 21 years." Here was just
                            as imperative a provision, and the one just as self-executing as the
                            other. He hoped the gentleman would not insist on his motions but let
                            the bill go to the Judiciary Committee. Debate could
                            be had on the report of the Committee.
                    
                    
                        THE PUTNAM CONTESTS.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN now called for the special order for the hour of 10
                            o'clock.
                        The SPEAKER said the special order was the consideration of the majority
                            report of the Committee on Elections in the Putnam
                            county contests. [It was erroneously stated in these reports of February
                            10, that the majority of the committee found Mr. Hamrick to have
                            received, a majority of one over Mr. Colover. The report finds that he
                            received 151 majority over Mr. Colover's vote, and 171 majority over Mr.
                            Puett's vote]
                        Mr. GRIFFITH moved to postpone the special order, and that the House go
                            into Committee of the Whole on the message and Mr. Whiteside's joint
                            resolution No. 13.
                        Mr. PUETT asked that the special order be put off on account of his own
                            ill health, and because the minority report was not ready.
                        Mr. KILGORE urged the consideration of the report. Extending courtesy to
                            the sitting members should not lead us into discourtesy towards the
                            contestants.
                        Mr. DUNHAM said this was not a question of courtesy, but a question
                            involving the rights of constituencies. The proposition to pass upon the
                            report was unjust to parties. It was not the report of the
                                Committee on Elections. He had been informed that
                            all the members of that committee were not in session when that report
                            was agreed upon.
                        Mr. SHUEY (in his seat.) That is not true. 
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker-
                        Mr. SHUEY. May I ask a question?-
                        Mr. DUNHAM (interposing.) No, sir! It is the language of a scoundrel and
                            a blackguard. The Speaker's hammer and the voices of members called to
                            order.
                        Mr. BROWN. The gentleman from Floyd has rights upon this floor. 
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Floyd-sit down!
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. Gentlemen ought to be courteous. He did not think the remark
                            of the gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange was intended to be
                            discourteous-to provoke belligerent demonstrations.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. I say the gentleman on the other side first departed from the
                            courtesy of debate. Do gentlemen suppose that I am going to stand
                            quietly and have the charge of falsehood hurled into my teeth.
                            [''Order," "order."] Do you profess to be gentlemen and say that I shall
                            not be heard; whilst a man that departs from the courtesies of life and
                            gentility is to be heard?
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair must call upon the gentleman from Floyd to take
                            his seat.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Yes sir. I will sit down.
                        Mr. SHUEY. Mr. Speaker, I desire to explain.
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange.
                        Mr. SHUEY. Mr. Speaker, of course, I spoke hastily; but I did not say as
                            much as I desired to say. I desire to say now, that I did not intend to
                            accuse the gentleman from Floyd with falsehood. I only intended to say
                            that the statement was not true as a matter of fact. I have heard that
                            the gentleman had such information, But his information was not
                            correct.
                         Mr. DUNHAM interposing. I accept the explanation, and take back the
                            offensive language.
                        Mr. SHUEY. If I had not discovered that I had violated parliamentary
                            usage in not addressing the chair, I should have said that the
                            gentleman's information was not true. I will say now, that every member
                            of the committee on Elections was present, except the gentleman from.
                            Lagrange, (Mr. Griffith,) but the gentleman from Tippecanoe, (Mr.
                            Miller,) had been appointed to take his place. So, the information of
                            the gentleman from Floyd was incorrect.
                        The SPEAKER. The chair will say to gentlemen, that this is a question
                            simply to postpone, and it is not debateable. The chair has allowed it
                            to run on in order to bring parties to a better understanding.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker, I hope I may have the consent of the House to
                            say a word in response to the gentleman-a single remark. My information
                            was as I stated; and if the honorable gentleman had said my information
                            was incorrect, I should have taken his word for it. The gentleman from
                            Marion is mistaken when he says I am belligerent. I have no desire to be
                            so considered. But I have the instinctive manhood to resent insult, when
                            I suppose insult is intended. I am entirely satisfied with the
                            explanation of the gentleman from Lagrange, and I apologize to the
                            House. I did not understand him.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to amend the motion to postpone, so as to make it the
                            special order 'or Monday 2 o'clock. He proceeded (by unanimous consent)
                            to state that he left the chairman representing the minority of the
                            Committee on Elections late last night-at half past 12 -engaged in the
                            preparation of the minority report. He understood that he wrote all
                            night; and he expected that he would be here in a short time, with a
                            summary and abstract of all the testimony that has been taken in the
                            case. This involved an important matter to the people of Putnam county,
                            and if it be postponed  till
                            Monday, we can be heard with an abstract of the testimony on both sides
                            before us, The argument could be completed in a short time.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH (By unanimous consent) He was a member of the Committee on
                            Elections. It was true that he had met with them and was present at
                            their sessions, until within a few days past, he had been absent on duty
                            with the Committee on the Northern Prison. He had made his motion to
                            postpone, because he was desirous of coming to a vote on the joint
                            resolution to ratify the proposed amendment of the Constitution of the
                            United States-by far the most important question that will arise during
                            the session. He knew there were gentlemen on our side desirous of being
                            heard; and gentlemen on the other side wishing to speak this afternoon.
                            He would not now press his motion, though be thought this matter ought
                            to be made, subsidiary to the ratification of the Constitutional
                            amendment.
                        Mr. DUNHAM desired to couple with the postponement a motion, that the
                            report with the evidence be printed.
                        Mr. KILGORE, It would make a volume larger than Webster's Unabridged.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. That made only the greater necessity for printing, if we are
                            to act judicially. He did not see how it were possible to understand the
                            case without having the testimony before us.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. There were but two controverted points. But a very small
                            portion of the testimony would have to be read.
                        Mr. KILGORE did not see how a privilege question could be postponed
                            without consent.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB was very anxious to have this matter determined, and he knew
                            the contesters were extremely anxious; but the gentleman from Monroe had
                            intimated that when it shall be taken up on Monday there will be no
                            factious opposition made, and the gentleman from Putnam (Mr. Puett)
                            appeals to us on account of ill-health. In view of these facts, he was
                            content to postpone.
                        The motion to postpone till Monday at 2 o'clock was then agreed to.
                        Mr. DUNHAM now urged his motion to print 200 copies of the reports of the
                            majority and minority.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB The minority report might be so long that we could not get it
                            printed by Monday.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, Did the majority report contain an abstract of
                            the testimony?
                        Mr. KILGORE, It did not.
                        Mr. MILLER. For that reason he objected to the printing of the minority
                            report.
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved to lay the motion to print on the table.
                        
                        The yeas and nays being demanded thereon by Messrs. Brown and Thacher,
                            and being ordered and taken resulted--yeas 49, nays 37.
                        So the House refused to print.
                    
                    
                        CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.
                        
                        Mr. Griffith's motion to go into Committee of the
                                Whole was now renewed.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB saw no necessity for proceedings in committee. Debate could
                            be just as well offered in the House. He preferred to take up the
                            Senate's resolution for amendments of the Constitution.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. As we could not reach the Senate joint resolution to-day,
                            without suspending the constitutional restriction, he thought it best
                            and shortest to consider the House resolution, and ask the Senate to
                            concur in our action. He proposed, therefore, to take up that
                            resolution. He made that motion.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH then withdrew his motion.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE considered that it was best to take up the Senate joint
                            resolution. The vote could not be reached to-day, and he did wish to
                            press the vote, for there was no question, before the General Assembly
                            of more profound importance.
                        Mr. BRANHAM had no choice individually. He would like to accommodate both
                            sides. He would be willing to take up the Senate resolution.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was willing to take up the Senate proposition and read it,
                            and after debate he would be willing to suspend the constitutional
                            restriction.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM (he having withdrawn his former motion) the
                            Senate joint resolution (No. 16) accepting and ratifying certain
                            amendments to the Constitution of the United States, proposed to the
                            Legislatures of the several States, was taken up, read through by the
                            Clerk, and passed to the second reading.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the constitutional restriction was
                            suspended-yeas 75, nays 7-and the joint resolution was ordered to the
                            second reading and read the second time by the Clerk.
                        On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the House then resolved into Committee
                                of the Whole--Mr. Henricks in the Chair--and took up the
                            consideration of Senate joint resolution No. 16.
                        The CHAIRMAN. The joint resolution before the committee is new matter,
                            and be would like to have an expression of opinion as to whether it
                            shall be a continuation of the same subject so far as to preclude
                            gentlemen who have spoken from being heard again whilst others who have
                            not spoken shall be desirous of occupying the floor. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired to be heard, but would not claim the floor to the
                            exclusion of any gentleman desiring to be heard.
                        Mr. BROWN made a similar statement.
                        Mr. BURWELL quoted Mr. Clay's option of the Abolitionists in his speech
                            in the Senate the United States in 1839, entertaining, as he said, the
                            same opinion himself. He did not expect that the vote on this question
                            could be changed by anything he or his friends would say. Our people had
                            boasted much of the greatness and renown of our country and her
                            institutions, even whilst slavery was supported by State laws and
                            recognized by the general constitution. But somehow we seemed to have
                            forgotten these better days, as well as the teaching our fathers
                            designed to perpetuate our benignant institutions. This has been the
                            case especially since Mr. Lincoln's annunciation of the "irrepressible
                            coriflict." He thought if this conflict goes on, it might change the
                            relation and give freedom to the blacks; but we should be cautioned in
                            doing so, that we do not enslave the white race. The right to regulate
                                 slavery was understood as
                            amongst the reserved rights of the sovereign States. Here he quoted from
                            Thomas Jefferson's inaugural address,admitting that Mr. Jefferson was an
                            anti-slavery man, but denying that he ever advocated the right to
                            destroy slavery by the power of the General Government.
                        Mr. Jefferson says the tendency of such intervention is anti-republican,
                            and the doctrine of State Rights was the safest bulwark against it. Mr
                            B. considered that the adoption of these amendments would prolong the
                            war. Apprehension of this interference had precipitated cession. And if
                            Mr. Lincoln had been faithful to his pledges, the war might have been
                            prevented, or long since brought to a close. He considered and commended
                            the war policy of General McClellan and as alleged by the gentleman from
                            Floyd, such has been the war policy of every successful General in
                            history. History will attribute the failure of our campaigns for the
                            first two years of the war to the abolition inferences at Washington
                            with the operations in the field.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, anxiously desired final action on this question,
                            but wished to be heard from a sense of duty to his constituents. He
                            could not go home-could not die satisfied-without giving expression of
                            his sentiments on the question. If England and Russia could throw off
                            the shackles of the slave, should not at least as much be expected from
                            American statesmen? He concurred in the ethical doctrines of the
                            gentleman from Floyd, with respect to the dignity of human nature, but
                            he was not afraid of the competition of the blacks. He was astonished at
                            gentlemen professing to be no apologists for slavery, and desirous of
                            its extinction, and at the same time opposed this joint resolution on
                            the ground that the Constitution, don't provide for it by Congress. Why,
                            this was but a resolution to ratify what Congress proposes, not what
                            Congress does. The act of coming into the Union was an agreement on the
                            part of all the States to the provisions of the Constitution for the
                            amendment thereof. He would give compensation for the slaves even of
                            rebels, on the condition that they would pile up gold and greenbacks
                            enough to pay for lives of his relations that fell at Stone river-and
                            for all the blood that has enriched the ground, and all the bones
                            mouldering in the grave on account of this rebellion. He urged
                            considerations for prompt action on this question.
                        Replying to the allegation that the Administration had been supported by
                            all the men and money it asked for, he said that the country had not
                            enjoyed the moral support of too many calling themselves Democrats.
                        He read from a Democratic address printed in 1862, recommending the very
                            amendment of the Constitution proposed in this joint resolution. He
                            could close his remarks the sooner on account of his eagerness to make
                            haste to ratify those amendments. He predicted that, if you take off the
                            cloud of slavery from this whole country, the black race will not come
                            north. They were created for a warmer climate. He spurned the imputation
                            of negro quality. If God made a negro his equal, or his superior, he had
                            no quarrel with the Supreme.His opinion was that this war was
                            providentially prolonged that God might vindicate his right to
                            disfranchise the race of blacks in the country. Batik will change the
                            organic law, say gentleman. Aye, but it was the rebel revolutionists
                            that first attempted to break the organic law and was is it not better
                            to amend, or even to revolutionize for the right, than for the
                            wrong.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the committee then rose and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to sit again
                            at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                    

                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the House resolved into Committee of
                                the Whole--Mr. Henricks in the Chair--and took up the
                            consideration of the Executive and the Senate joint resolution No. 16.
                        Mr. GREGG took the floor and proceeded to deliver some of the reasons why
                            he could not vote to ratify the proposed amendment. His party had ever
                            acted cautiously in the exercise of doubtful powers. He joined issue
                            with Mr. Speaker Pettit, against his allegation, that in this matter of
                            amendment of the Constitution we exercise nothing but a political right.
                            Did it not inflict a wrong on the State of Kentucky, to strike down
                            $34,000,000 of her property? He would not, as belonging to the
                            three-fourths of the Confederation, assist in tearing off the scarf of
                            right from the other fourth, because that scarf is of a different color
                            and texture.
                        It might be well to consider lest we be found like the man that attempted
                            to exercise the right to shear the wolf, never thinking of anything but
                            the right. Was it not an attempt to incorporate into the Constitution
                            the political creed of a very reckless political party? How long before
                            it will be proposed to make white and black equal before the law? He
                            regarded the Constitution as ample in its provisions to create the
                            Union, and bind it together in perpetual Union. This was demonstrated in
                            the successful administration of that Constitution for sixty years.
                            Besides, this was no time to change the Constitution; it was rather a
                            special time when we ought to come together for the defense of the
                            Constitution, and lock our shields over it. When peace returns, then,
                            and not till then, would come the appropriate time to amend the
                            Constitution. He would have gentlemen to take the advice of the
                            President, on his way to take the seat of the Chief Magistrate. When Mr.
                            Lincoln, at Lawrenceburg, first saw the soil of Kentucky, after his
                            first election, he advised the country not to meddle with the domestic
                            affairs of our neighbors over the river. This was a local question which
                            belonged to Kentucky and other States interested, to settle for
                            themselves. It was to defame the fathers of the Republic to declare that
                            this Constitution had come down to us through all these years of
                            prosperity and happiness, bearing within itself the seeds of its own
                            destruction. He feared the conflict of races that would follow upon the
                            consummation of this measure, more than he ever dreaded the
                            "irrepressible conflict.
                        
                        Mr. ZEIGLER. If slavery were right and politic, why not have it in
                            Indiana? But if slavery were wrong, why not reform it by legislation-by
                            Constitutional amendment, in a Constitutional way? Opposition to slavery
                            and opposition to this amendment, which had been professed in so many
                            speeches here, reminded him of the drunkard's profession that he does
                            not love liquor. He was distinctly in favor of this proposition, He
                            agreed with the gentleman from Wabash, [Mr. Pettit,] that the
                            institution of slavery is inconsistent with our form of government.
                            Slavery was a moral evil. It was repugnant to the institution of
                            Christianity. It ignored the marriage relation, and the relation of
                            parent and child. It was too nice a thing for him to distinguish between
                            political and moral evils. Slavery was intrinsically evil-socially,
                            morally and politically. Gentleman insisted that slavery was not the the
                            cause of this rebellion, but its agitation. Who agitated? Did gentlemen
                            suppose they themselves were guiltless in this matter on this floor,
                            when they clamor for debate, to inform the country of their individual
                            action? He did not see how this amendment could protract the war or
                            increase the strength of the rebellion. He supposed that the rebels were
                            doing all they could. Equality before it then would not make the negro
                            the equal of the white man. Men were men morally, physically,
                            intellectually: and they were relatively superior or inferior as they
                            progressed and exercised these characteristics. He supposed his
                            posterity would be able to stand on their own merits without, referee to
                            the negro.
                        Mr. BROWN rose to respond to Mr. Speaker Pettit's remarks last night. The
                            gentleman from Wabash maintained that it is competent, under the Federal
                            Constitution, for three-fourths of the States to so amend the
                            Constitution as to confer on the Federal Government the power to
                            exercise any right, except two the one with reference to fugitive
                            slaves, and the other with reference to the slave trade, a prohibition
                            which extended no longer than the year 1808. He (Mr. B ) laid down the
                            doctrine that it is not competent for the Constitution ot the United
                            States to be amended, except in so far as to give to the Federal
                            Government power to exercise these specific rights which the States and
                            the people have delegated. 
                        It was well known that ia the beginning of this Government that there
                            were two parties, headed by Hamilton and Jefferson. The sovereign power
                            vested originally with the States They became independent. They
                            delegated special power to the Federal Government. Thomas Jefferson and
                            Patrick Henry doubted whether the rights of States were sufficiently
                            guarded, and they submitted the amendments that remain a part of the
                            Constitution, including the restriction, that rights not delegated are
                            reserved to the States and the people. He replied to the argument of
                            precedents, drawn from the cession of the territory north-west of the
                            Ohio river. Before Virginia gave up her title she made it a conditional
                            precedent, that slavery should not go into that territory.
                        The gentlemen said the records of Congress did not, show this; but there
                            was a history behind that, Virginia desired to provide that her negroes
                            should not be removed to the Northwest. It would retard her progress. He
                            was sustained by the debates in the Virginia Assembly in the declaration
                            that Virginia made this a condition precedent to the cession of the
                            Northwestern territory. He read from the Madison papers to show that
                            this cession was encumbered with conditions which delayed its
                            acceptance, and that the ordinance was drafted ia accordance with the
                            conditions fixed by Virginia. He disputed the statement in the pending
                            Executive message, that Indiana was made a free State by the ordinance
                            of 1787. It was a well known fact that there were slaves in the
                            territories of Indiana and Illinois down to the time, and even after the
                            time of their admission as States into the Union. If, then, that
                            ordinance could not exclude slavery from these territories, how could it
                            be said by the gentleman from Wabash that it conferred on Congress the
                            power to legislate on the subject of slavery? He referred to the
                            articles of the cession of the territory of Louisiana, requiring of the
                            United States that the institution of slavery should be, respected and
                            protected forever as pertaining to the rights of the inhabitants
                            thereof. Would not Louis Napoleon be justified in forming an alliance
                            with Louisiana protect her people in the enjoyment of that
                            institution?
                        Should not gentlemen here legislate with the intelligence, liberality and
                            purity of purpose of the late John Quincy Adams at the time of the
                            admission of the State of Arkansas, when he said with reference to
                            slavery in that State, "It is written in the bond," and he acquiesced.
                            He reviewed the political tirgiversations of the gentleman from Wabash
                            [Mr. Speaker Petit,] and found him "sometimes advocating the same
                            general principles of right of which he [Mr. B] was now the humble
                            advocate. Three-fourths of the States could not delegate the secured
                            rights written in the Constitution. Congress could as well assume this
                            right, as for three-fourths of the States to do it. The only difference
                            was, that, in the one case Congress had little cross-eyed backing, and
                            in the other case it would present a bolder assumption of power. He
                            closed with expressions of high hope for the country, and of personal
                            good feeling, according sincerity and honesty of purpose to every member
                            of the Committee of the Whole.
                        Mr. FOULKE. He had no fear of the bug-bear of negro equality. It might be
                            that legal restrictions against intermarriages with the inferior race
                            would be necessary. He saw the cause of the commencement of the war in
                            the encroachments of slavery. Was slavery so sacred a thing that we
                            should not touch it? It had impoverished our territory; it was the enemy
                            of schools; it was the most dangerous foe of the Democracy, and in this
                            treasonous rebellion it had committed the greatest of crimes, for which
                            it must die. The great difficulty with the opposition here, (as it would
                            seem from the remarks of the gentle Sullivan, Mr. Burton,) was that gold
                            and greenbacks are going up, and slavery and Democracy are going
                            down.
                        Mr. THACHER though the youngest member on this floor, felt it to be his
                            duty to define  his position to
                            this question. Were be a Republican, he would not think it politic to
                            advocate this amendment, because it would take away all their thunder.
                            He referred with feelings of pride to the administration of James
                            Buchanan. That was the last administration under the constitution as our
                            fathers made it. When gentlemen say that that administration lacked
                            backbone, it should be remembered that there was a Republican Congress
                            to embarrass it; and when Buchanan asked that Congress for men and money
                            to put down the rebellion, in December, 1860, they paid no attention to
                            the matter. They determined to have a rupture. Peace was not what was
                            wanted by the Abolition delegates to the Peace Congress. They were
                            advise d to provoke a little "blood-letting," and they took the
                            advice.
                        Mr. STEWART was glad of the opportunity to go on the record in connection
                            with this question. He entered life as an anti-slavery man. He took the
                            position here that slavery is a public shame, a great national
                            disparagement. He considered that there were great conservative
                            principles that lie back of constitutions, involving self-protection-
                            the protection of parties to the Constitution-of those that made the
                            Constitution. Constitutions were but exponents of principles-the
                            principles themselves lying; back and beneath them. Then should we not
                            avail ourselves of those principles in our action on the pending
                            questions? This was an encroaching, an arrogant, and intolerant
                            institution-assuming to be mother of States and statesmen, and demanding
                            additional safeguards for itself, that the laws should make us a nation
                            of slave-catchers Such were the encroachments of this institution of
                            slavery. He desired a permanent peace. He remembered the public
                            rejoicings at peace with Mexico, sixteen years ago. We had six regiments
                            in that war, and we have 140 regiments in the present war. For his part,
                            he desired peace-a lasting, permanent peace. This war had robbed him of
                            his excellent friends, General Hackleman, Colonel Wolf, and others. This
                            gave him an interest in this war. And he remembered that all national
                            blessings came over the pathway of war-great evil as it is. We have to
                            deal with facts When this constitutional amendment, this fiat of the
                            people, shall have gone forth, there will be occasion of rejoicing such
                            as the world has never witnessed since that greatest of all the epochs
                            of rejoicing in the rays of the star of Bethlehem.
                        Mr. MILROY opposed these amendments, because of the corruption of the
                            source from which they come. And when their ulterior objects should be
                            understood, those fanatical rulers will be hurled from their high
                            places. He scouted the idea of rejoicing over the success of this
                            measure-as compared with that on the plains of Bethlehem.
                        Mr. COX was a member of the original Liberty party. He had cast his vote
                            in the direction of liberty since the year 1840. To the allegation that
                            abolition was a curse to the country, he submitted the question whether
                            ever an abolitionist was known to become a traitor? He showed that
                            slavery was the cause of the war, yet the abolitionists that have
                            successfully confronted the slavs power, were a curse, to the country!
                            He commenced the investigation of this subject twenty-five years ago,
                            and be was exultant in what had been achieved for liberty in that time.
                            The deep-mouthed cannon would soon express the public rejoicings on
                            account of the passage of this joint resolution. He gloried in what he
                            had done for the emancipation of slaves. He had conducted the
                            underground railroad in Eastern Indiana. And when the laws of his
                            country opposed his vocation, he had to work after night. He would not
                            have told this sixteen years ago. His parents had been driven from the
                            Southern States by the slave power. Were they not being avenged to-day?
                            If he had digressed from the line of argument that ought to be pursued,
                            he supposed he had not departed further from the question than some
                            others. He closed by felicitating himself on account of the good
                            company, the large, the gifted, the respectable and constantly
                            increasing company which he found himself in the support of this
                            proposition.
                        Mr. HOWARD defined his position and gave the reason for his vote. It was
                            enough for him to know that this proposition comes up at this particular
                            hour of war, to determine him to oppose it. Twenty millions of the
                            people of this country were striving by force of arms to compel the
                            remaining eight millions to submit to the constitution. This was not a
                            time far such a proposition, involving the very issue in the quarrel. He
                            would rather pour oil on the troubled waters. He did not believe there
                            was a statesman in the country whose judgment was not opposed to this
                            proposition, because it would throw another obstacle in the way of the
                            settlement of our national difficulties. What was the issue in this war?
                            The subjugation of rebels, or the abolition of slavery? He had heard Mr.
                            Gary, a Republican leader, declare that he was glad that this war was
                            not over, because the destruction of slavery was not yet consummated.
                            Was this indeed the object for which all our sacrifices were demanded?
                            He referred to the false prophesies with reference to the close of the
                            war, to justify his want of confidence in those men in high places. They
                            did not yet appreciate the magnitude of our difficulties.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS replied to Mr. Brown. The gentleman was mistaken. He showed
                            the position of parties when Hamilton and Jefferson were leaders. The
                            party of Jefferson prevailed and it was that party which effected the
                            two amendments (which he read) to restrain the power of the Supreme
                            Court. He read the restrictions of the amendments in the fifth article.
                            From the fact that certain parts of the Constitution may not be repealed
                            or amended, might it not be assuredly inferred that it may be amended in
                            the prescribed constitutional manner in every other respect? It would
                            not have been reasonable for a democratic people to have made a
                            Constitution that could not be amended. That would be an approach toward
                            despotism itself. But for this principle of peaceful amendment, there
                            would more frequently arise the temptation to appeal to the sword to
                            decide questions which could not be reached otherwise. Had it not been
                            for this remedy for the abolition of slavery, the abolitionists would
                            have been the first rebels, and  he
                            himself might have been one of them. This amendment should be ratified,
                            not only for the honor of the country, but to settle such disputed
                            questions as the legality of the President's emancipation proclamation.
                            He voted for this amendment because he believed it would shorten the
                            war, because it was desired by his people, and because it would carry
                            out the principles rehearsed in the preamble to the Constitution, and in
                            the Constitution itself. And it was to-day demanded by a majority of
                            20,000 of the people of the State of Indiana. If gentlemen would obey
                            the veice of the people of the State, let them come up and record their
                            names for the adoption of this joint resolution.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the committee rise, report progress, and ask leave
                            to sit again Monday night.
                        Mr. BRANHAM proposed to sit again tonight.
                        Mr. KILGORE preferred Monday for sundry considerations.
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY wanted to go home with the evening train.
                        Mr. JAMES was not going to make a speech on this question, he was tired
                            of debate, but still he wanted gentlemen desirous of speech to be
                            accommodated as speedily as possible.
                        Mr. BRANHAM had made his motion to save time. 
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, was going home tonight. The speeches to-night might
                            convert him.
                        Mr. BRANHAM would acquiesce, if gentlemen would agree to come to the vote
                            on Monday night.
                        Mr. GROVES desired a night session.
                        Mr. SIM liked the suggestion to follow the example of the Senate-pass the
                            resolution, and then afterwards allow gentlemen to preach their funeral
                            semons respectively.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK expected to be heard again, and was willing for the vote to
                            be taken on Monday night; and he thought that was the mind of Democratic
                            members generally.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, preferred to report the subject back to the
                            House.
                        Mr. BRANHAM modified his motion so as to sit again Monday morning.
                        Mr. WRIGHT made an ineffectual motion to sit again to-night.
                        Mr. BRANHAM'S motion prevailed; and then the committee rose, and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported progress, and asked and obtained leave to sit again
                            on Monday morning, 9 o'clock.
                        On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, it was
                        Ordered, that when the House adjourns, it shall be till Monday morning, 9
                            o'clock; and then-at 5:35 P. M.,
                        On motion by Mr. COLLINS, the House adjourned.
                    
                

                
                
                     IN SENATE.
                    
                         MONDAY, February 13, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The Secretary's journal of Saturday's proceedings was being read, when-
                    On motion by Mr. COBB, the further reading hereof was dispensed with.
                    
                        APPROPRIATION FOR WOOD.
                        Mr. DUNNING offered the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That the Auditor of State be,
                                        and he is hereby instructed to draw his warrant upon the
                                        Treasurer of State in favor of John H. Johnson, Doorkeeper
                                        to the Senate, for three hundred and sixty-two dollars, for
                                        51 5-7 cords of wood, at $7 per cord, as per contract made
                                        by paid Johnson with Stephen Rybolt, on January 25th, 1865,
                                        and approved-by the Senate on the same day, [see page 109 of
                                        the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,] said wood when accurately
                                        measured, exceeding the amount named in said contract, 1 and
                                        1-5 of a cord, to be paid out of the legislative fund of the
                                        present session of the General Assembly, and that the
                                        Doorkeeper take a receipt of said Rybolt for said sum of
                                        money, and file the same with the Treasurer of the
                                        State.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted by consent
                    
                    
                        EMPLOYES OF THE SENATE.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR laid before the Senate communications in answer
                            to a resolution adopted Saturday, by which it appears that the Principal
                            Secretary has appointed nine assistants; the Assistant Secretary six;
                            the Principal Doorkeeper fourteen, and the Assistant Doorkeeper
                            eleven.
                    

                    
                        POSTAGE STAMPS.
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, the vote adopting the resolution for postage
                            stamps, (seepage 17 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS) was
                            reconsidered.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING the resolution was laid on the table.
                        Mr. COBB offered the following, which was adopted by consent.
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Doorkeeper be, and he is
                                        hereby directed to purchase six dollars' worth of postage

                                     WHEREAS, A few weeks more time would
                                        enable the State of Indiana to fill her quota by volunteers
                                        under the late call of the President of the United States;
                                        therefore,
                                     Resolved by the Senate of the State of
                                            Indiana, the House concurring, That the President
                                        of the United States be, and he is hereby requested, if not
                                        incompatible with the public welfare, to extend the time for
                                        filling the quota of the State of Indiana for the period of
                                        thirty days, or to grant such other extension of time as to
                                        His Excellency may seem expedient.

                         Mr. HANNA said: The General Assembly of Ohio has passed a resolution
                            similar to this, and certainly no honorable Senator can object to it. I
                            am told Governor Morton has said if we had ten days' more time we would
                            fill our quota. At any rate the resolution does not tend to embarrass
                            any body, and I hope it will be adopted unanimously. 
                        The resolution was adopted by consent.

                        The previous question shall be put in this form: "Shall the main question
                            be now put?" It shall only be admitted when demanded by eighteen
                            members; and until it is decided, shall preclude all debate, and the
                            introduction of all further amendments.
                        The main question shall be the first question in order, and its effect
                            shall be to put an end to all debate, and, bring the Senate to a direct
                            vote on the questions then pending, in their order, and then on the main
                            question.

                        the amendment to the constitution, proposed by the Congress of the United
                        States.
                    Mr. WRIGHT, said it was not his purpose to say more on this question, but
                        still he found somewhat to offer, as nobody seemed to desire the floor.
                        These Democratic speeches here were after the model of Southern rebel
                        speeches. Their doctrines were of the same school. He stated them.
                    The proposition before the House was to extend human freedom. How then could
                        a friend of human freedom oppose it? Sad would be our national condition if
                        it was not competent for us to abolish slavery this Pandora box of all our
                        public evils. Gentlemen would not allow to the people of the United States
                        the powers exercised by a common municipal corporation. He had been called a
                        steamboat captain in this debate; which lead him to compare slavery in this
                        State government to a disease on a steamboat that might be held to
                        quarantine by any town she might be approaching, notwithstanding her papers.
                        Would it be contended that the people of the United States have less power
                        than the authorities in any town on the river? He glanced at the similarity
                        of the speeches hereby the gentleman from Jackson (Mr. Brown) and the
                        address of Benedict Arnold. He condemned the criminal inaction of Mr.
                        Buchanan's Democratic administration before the war opened. The Mississippi
                        river was blockaded the 9th of December, 1860. Why were gentlemen so
                        reluctant to give up slavery? Aye, they knew they could never elect a
                        President without its aid. The Democratic party and slavery would go down
                        together in the same day. Aye, they were already gone, beyond the reach of
                        any power but that of the hand of the resurrection. The question was a plain
                        one. It was to extend freedom to every portion of the human family.
                    The champion of slavery (Jeff. Davis) was opposed to the rule of the majority
                        so it was with the gentleman from Jackson, claiming that three-fourths
                        cannot amend the Constitution. He knew not why he had been made the target
                        for the bow of the gentlemen from Floyd, (Mr. Dunham,) unless it was because
                        he had preferred his country to his party, in these times of her peril. He
                        had made his choice deliberately. Why did not the gentleman reason, instead
                        of resorting to slang? But blessed are the persecuted for righteousness'
                        sake and if ever there was a righteous cause among men, this was one. The
                        best blood of this country bad been shed on the altar of slavery and it had
                        brought free Government nigh to its overthrow. It had refused obedience to
                        law and protection was the price of obedience. The gentleman from Floyd
                        boasted that he had been in the war. How? Like the boy that had been to
                        college-centered at one door and kicked out at the other. Why was he not
                        still in the field? Three votes that he bad given in his political life he
                        regretted: those for Buchanan, Breckinridge and Dunham! He closed with
                        earnest and eloquent deprecations against the efforts of the Democratic
                        party to steal away the confidence of the people in their government. These
                        efforts had protracted the war. He animadverted on the report of the
                        Committee of the last House of'Representatives on Arbitrary Arrests. That
                        report did not find a single man to testify that he had been arrested for
                        his loyalty.


                    Mr. HUNT. Speeches here on the part of the minority could not amount to
                        anything but to define the position of individual members. Was it indeed a
                        proud act of a man's political history to support this measure? He would say
                        that he was proud of his position, because he could go on the record in
                        opposition to it.--He supported a Government for white men. There was
                        buncombe for votes in the affirmative speeches here. He would speak to the
                        principle involved. Thin proposition was for a radical change in the
                        Government. It was claimed that it would destroy slavery, and that it would
                        remove the cause of our National difficulties. Would the abolition of
                        slavery remove the African race from the country? If it would, the amendment
                        might be wise. The cause of our difficulties lay deeper than slavery-- it
                        was in the agitation of the subject of slavery-- in the depravity of men. He
                        defended the Democratic party from the charge of bringing on the war. Were
                        they inciting to war, when they were contemptuously called "Union savers?"
                        Did not the South rather secede on the pledge of being left alone by
                        Northern abolition leaders? He was no friend of slavery, but would tolerate
                        it rather than disrupt the Union. 
                    
                    Mr. WOODRUFF had heard the cartwheel screechers, but ne'er before heard he
                        such speeches. 'Servants ye are to whom ye obey." This was true politically
                        as well as religiously. We could not serve two masters. The choice for us
                        was between the rule of Jeff Davis and that of Abraham Lincoln. Slavery was
                        dead, so there could be no more abolitionists. It was undeniable that
                        slavery had caused the war, and for that it should die. Its death-note was
                        the first gun that was fire on Fort Sumter. We were healthy or sickly
                        according to our food. So, if we receive unwholesome mental aliment it makes
                        us unhealthy citizens. Of such unwholesome stuff were the teachers of many
                        Democratic newspapers which he named. Some Indiana soldiers conferred a
                        brief public favor in the destruction of one of these furnishers of
                        unwholesome food--the Terre Haute Journal. He commends the sincere milk of
                        the word of the Constitution, to lead the minds of all to the adoption of
                        this amendment, and to decree the extinction of an American slavery beyond
                        the power of recovery to life. He commended the negro before the Democratic
                        leader, because the former took up arms for the defense of the country,
                        whilst the latter remained at home to sow the seeds of discontent. The
                        patriotism of the former at least commended him to freedom.
                     Mr. COLLINS would give reasons for his vote. This measure, in his judgment,
                        was wrong-it was especially ill-timed. The objection that it violated the
                        rights of property was well taken against it. It would prolong the war, and
                        war was opposed to Christianity. No good could result from hasty and
                        passionate action. But the world's history was a story of war, blood and
                        destruction, induced by men in high places and out of danger. Special
                        providences in this war were no more to his mind than the saying of
                        Napoleon, that the Lord was on the side of the party having the largest
                        cannon. He adverted to Mr. Cox's vaunting his violation of the. laws,
                        justified by the evils of slavery. That gentleman, if he would look about
                        him, might see a deeper degradation in the free negro than in the negro
                        slave. His hope of the Union, under the present policy, was gone.
                    Neither could the war be closed under it, but by the destruction of the
                        people of the south. The source of our Union was in the hearts cf the
                        people, and the men that sowed the seeds of dissension was an enemy of the
                        Union. He did not agree with all his political friends.. If the negro was to
                        remain on the American continent, his place was subjection-for he bore the
                        stamp of inferiority. The negro was a human being. But every where, in all
                        history, he had been subject to the stronger race.--Freed in the West India
                        Island, he had degenerated into barbarism. He would enslave the black as
                        long as he remained on this continent for his own good.
                    Mr. RIFORD. Mr. Chairman: I had thought I would not take up the time of this
                        Committee in making remarks on the passage of this resolution. But, feeling
                        myself called up in to cast my vote as one of the Representatives of we
                        proud State of Indiana, to ratify one of the greatest acts of philanthropy
                        that has been done by any nation since men formed themselves into a national
                        capacity, and to me it will be one of the proudest acts of my life to cast
                        my vote to ratify the amendment to our national Constitution, that will
                        remove slavery and involuntary servitude from our country. Then it win be in
                        fact as in name, the land of the free and home of the brave.
                    Mr. Chairman, I have several reasons why I rejoice in this privilege.
                    1st. Before this discussion commenced, to me it did seem that on such a
                        proposition there, would not be a dissenting voice, for whatever questions
                        have divided us heretofore, as most of us have decided that the American
                        people were capable of self-govern meat, and bad a Constitutional right to
                        amend her laws, fundamental, as well as statutory. What is this institution
                        of American slavery ? Is it too sacred to ba submitted to the ordeal and
                        judgment of our people? Why, sir, it is a system of fraud, injustice, crime
                        and tyranny.
                    In the language of that distinguished man, John Wesley, it is the sum of all
                        villanies for it tramples on every moral precept, defies every divine law,
                        destroys every natural right of man; like the poisonous upas, it diffuses
                        its deadly malaria into every avenue of society, wherever it exists. Master
                        and slave alike become its victim?; it debases the social circle, pollutes
                        the sanctuary, defiles the judiciary, corrupts every department of our
                        Government; like the old serpent, it has entered our garden of Eden, and
                        seduced from their loyalty many of the sons and daughters of this Republic,
                        winding its deadly folds around our tree of liberty, exercising'despotic
                        power in the very sanctum of her temples; for a long time has been the
                        deadly enemy of Republican institutions, molding the legislation of this
                        country, controlling the foreign policy of this Government, crippling the
                        power and energies of a free people, ruling the Executive and Judicial
                        departments; and in my humble opinion, we cannot hope for a complete success
                        in this conflict with secession, until slavery-acknowledged by a large
                        majority of the Americans to be the cause of this rebellion-shall be
                        extinguished by the ratification of the proposed amendment to the national
                        Constitution, that slavery nor involuntary servitude shall not exist in all
                        our wide domain except for crime. I have no doubt but Indiana, by her
                        Legislature, will take a proud stand on the side of freedom.
                    Slavery is dying. It raised its arm to destroy this Government based upon the
                        principles of extending the blessings of liberty to our posterity.
                     The American people have decreed by their vote within a few months, that
                        slavery is unfit to live, and that it shall die with this unhallowed
                        rebellion, and be buried in one common grave that Gabriel's trump shall not
                        resurrect.
                    I therefore for one rejoice that proud Indiana by her Legislature will assist
                        in their death and burial; for, sir, there is no panacea that will relieve
                        them. The skill of its ablest defenders cannot shield them from their
                        inevitable doom, and while in their agonizing death struggles. I for one
                        rejoice that I have the privilege to vote for that amendment, that un-  [un]der no circumstances hereafter
                        shall slavery raise its hydra head to strike down the flag of our glorious
                        country.
                    Mr. Chairman, slavery has poisoned public opinion, repressing the aspiration
                        of freedom, until it has made the American name a hissing and a by-word
                        among the nations of the earth, robbing them of their rights under our
                        Constitution, trampling every principle of the Declaration of Independence
                        under foot, last and not least waging a fiendish, malignant, hellish war
                        against our Government.
                    Bringing death into almost every loyal household, with untold misery upon
                        this our beloved nation, demanding that sacrifice of blood and treasure that
                        might appal and crush the spirit of any other people on earth, and yet with
                        this damnable record against this institution, there are men on the floor of
                        this House, enjoying the liberty of our glorious State, defended by the
                        blood of her sons, who hesitate to strike this last blow which will
                        exterminate the foul monster forever. How proud every lover of humanity will
                        be to vote for this resolution which will secure to themselves and their
                        posterity an honorable name that will be remembered with gratitude by untold
                        millions who are hereafter to enjoy its blessings.
                    Mr. Chairman, after arraigning slavery and its twin sister rebellion, before
                        the judicial minds of this committee, I must notice, in brief, some of the
                        arguments that have been made in its favor, but to some of the gentlemen on
                        the other side, who are not in favor of slavery, right here I wish to tell a
                        story, to illustrate the situation of some of the advocates that say that
                        they are not in favor of slavery. A certain minister's wife was very precise
                        in keeping the Sabbath; she was located in a dairy country. On a visit with
                        her neighbors, the subject came up as to labor on the Sabbath, when the good
                        woman said that they ought not even to cook their meals on that day.
                    She was asked the question, what she would do with the milk of a dairy on
                        that day? Said she, it is not right to make cheese on the Sabbath, but said
                        that she got along very well that summer, for they carried their milk to
                        brother Samson's Saturday night and Sunday, and they made the cheese.
                    Mr. Chairman, I will now briefly notice some of the things that have been
                        said by those who oppose the resolution that is before the committee; but
                        permit me here to say for myself that the legal gentleman on the other side
                        of the House seem to have, and in my judgment they have, a criminal case on
                        their hands, and I must say they manage it with some skill; hence they have
                        a reason which I accord to them for pettifogging, to evade the justice that
                        hangs over their clients. I would here state that I have personal respect
                        for them as gentlemen, so far as I have formed any acquaintance, which is
                        limited, as I do not belong to the legal profession.--With this explanation
                        for my position, Mr. Chairman, I will refer to what the gentleman from Cass
                        said, if I understood his words correctly. He said that in his judgment we
                        have no right to take advantage of the rebels while they are fighting
                        against this Government To take away their State rights, one was to hold
                        slaves. I suppose the gentleman would not say hat it was not right to take
                        away his gun when pointed at his breast. Most certainly a man has a
                        constitutional right to bear arms, therefore he would have no right,
                        according to his theory, to take away his gun.
                    Mr. Chairman, I think differently. When men raise their puny arm against this
                        Government, it has a right to take every means, slaves included, from them.
                        I will leave this position to the better judgment of this Committee.
                    The legal gentleman from Floyd was very lofty in discussing the subject of
                        this resolution, in which his client has life and death at stake. Sir, he
                        raised himself up to his full height, with upturned face and eyes, looking
                        through the sky-light of this house, toward heaven, calling on that Being
                        that is said to reside in that direction, attempting to quote his words,
                        saying that he did not compel men to lay down their arms. Now he was
                        mistaken. God did by his servants-did just what Abraham is doing. The
                        servants of God went out and invited the aristocrats to come. They refused.
                        Abraham sent out his servants, and invited the aristocracy to lay down their
                        arms and come in and enjoy his supper, but they refused. He then sent out
                        into the hedges and ditches to compel them to come in. So did the Lord. I am
                        taking too much time, therefore I will leave the gentleman from Floyd, with
                        the prisoner at the bar, with this Committee, believing that justice will be
                        done in the decision.
                    The gentleman from Dearborn said that he had no disposition to trouble
                        himself with the law of God. My opinion is that every member of this
                        Committee will assent to that, from the tenor of his speech mads in behalf
                        of the prisoners at the bar.
                    The gentleman from Wells based his plea for the criminals at the bar on this
                        ground, that Congress does net possess the power to amend the Constitution.
                        In this the gentleman is right, but, Mr. Chairman, it is my opinion that
                        when three-fourths of the people of the States, (not States as is often said
                        by gentlemen on the other side of the house,) vote to change the
                        Constitution in the manner described in that instrument, it is right, it is
                        just, for the reason that that clause was in it when ratified by tn original
                        States by the vote of the people, therefore, they cannot complain.
                    I am satisfied in my own mind that the Legislatures of three-fourths of the
                        States have the right to amend the national Constitution when in their
                        judgment it is for the benefit of the people of all the States. This is one
                        of the reasons which will control my vote on resolution. I do believe when
                        the smoke and din of war shall have passed away, we shall be a purer and
                        freer people, and with that servile institution removed from our land, our
                        associations, North and Sonth, will be much more pleasant, and we shall
                        become a free people in deed and truth. With the bitter slangs the gentleman
                        saw fit to indulge in, I have nothing to say, only I would as soon be called
                        the follower of Lincoln and Morton as the follower McClellan and
                        McDonald.
                    Mr. Chairman, the legal gentleman Jackson said that in the Louisiana purchase
                        the right to hold slaves was made perpetual in  the purchase. He may be right-so long as they
                        remained a Territory; but, sir, when their own free will they choose to
                        change their relation, forming themselves into a State, and by their choice
                        or petition became a part of the Government, they are bound by the
                        Constitution, therefore giving up by their own acts whatever claim they
                        might have had in the condition they were in at the time of the purchase.
                        Now, look at the gentleman's logic. He says that if we abolish slavery on
                        any part of the Louisiana purchase, France will come and take all of that
                        purchase away from us, because that would violate the conditions of
                        purchase.
                    Now, does not the gentleman know that in a large portion of that territory,
                        slavery has been abolished by a constitutional provision, just like this
                        that is before this committee, since Iowa was admitted into the Union. Now,
                        if the gentleman tells the truth, Iowa belongs of right to France, and is
                        not one of the United States. And I respectfully submit that, if, as be
                        says, every one who is ignorant of political history ought to go
                        steamboating, our friend from Jefferson can find some of his crew among the
                        members of this House.
                     I must say, that with the attention I paid to the gentleman's speech, that
                        he is a good lawyer in criminal courts, but I think he has got a case on
                        hand that will be decided against him.
                    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Shelby said that he voted for Buchanan, and
                        he had always felt proud of it, for it was probably the last Democratic
                        President we should ever have. Also that he held an office under that
                        Administration. As to old Buck being the last President of that strips, I
                        think he must be the son of a Prophet, for I think it will prove true. I
                        pray that it may, and think a number of my Democratic friends will join in
                        the same prayer.
                    Mr. Chairman: I feel that I should not do justice to myself and this
                        committee, if I did not notice the gentleman from Carroll, for I felt a pity
                        for the gentleman when I saw him in such agony at the thought that the black
                        man would become his equal. As to the danger he was in, after hearing such a
                        logical speech, I leave to the better judgment of this committee.
                    Mr. Chairman: The gentleman from Marshall and Stark gave us a very minute
                        description of his progress in human life; not much progressive after all,
                        for he said that he had never changed, and, Mr. Chairman, you will recollect
                        that the gentleman from Jackson said that wise men changed, but fools never.
                        I do not know how that is, as I am not a legal gentleman, therefore I will
                        leave that to the better judgment of the gentleman from Jackson.
                    Mr. Chairman: A few more words and I will close. There has been much said
                        about the great Democratic party. It sounds too much like the ancient cry:
                        "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" That great goddess fall, and so might
                        this great Democratic party, and the planetary systems still go on. Most
                        certainly the earth completes its diurnal and annual motion, notwithstanding
                        the great goddess Diana fell.
                    Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, in his remarks did not propose to indulge in
                        personalities. He simply wished to give his reasons for his vote. On no
                        question had he felt more decided as to his line of duty. Though he was
                        satisfied that this joint resolution would pass, yet fearing possible
                        misconstruction of his position, more here than at home, he ventured to
                        appear on the floor. A man acting under the conviction of right was entitled
                        to respect. Such was his position.- He looked upon this question not as a
                        partisan, but as to the facts and the law. The great point was this: Does it
                        become us here to legislate for other States? Was not this proposition an
                        infringement of rights reserved to the States and the people? Gentleman
                        seemed to speak here from passion and prejudice, leading to extremes.
                    He took neither extremes on the question of slavery--he regarded it as
                        neither the most accursed nor the most benificent institution. From the
                        affirmative debatants here, if it were not well known that other things have
                        caused war, one would be persuaded that slavery was the cause of this war.
                        He contended that not slavery, but sectional agitations had brought on the
                        war. Slavery had obtained in all ages of the world. It was a part of the
                        code that came from the Supreme in the thunders of Sinai. This being the
                        fact, he was cautious about receiving the declaration that slavery is a
                        curse-that we are cursed with war on account of slavery. In many ways it was
                        not the thing, but the abuse of it that constituted the evil. Money was a
                        good thing-especially hard money-but the love of it was the root of all
                        evil. He deprecated interference by the general government in the local
                        affairs of the States. He looked back to the time of the Revolutionary
                        war.
                    Our fathers fought through those seven years for a principle-independence-the
                        independence of the Colonies. These Colonies formed a confederation; but,
                        seeking to give the General Government more power, they formed the present
                        Constitution of the United States which we ail revere so much. Finding that
                        they might have delegated too much to the General Government, the same
                        parties amended that Constitution, so as to set bariers against invasion of
                        the local rights of the States. He regarded the perfection and completeness
                        in the display of statesmanship in that Constitution; and concluded that so
                        long as men would live wisely, uninfluenced by sectional fanaticism, the
                        Union formed under that Constitution, might last forever. He deprecated all
                        sectional strife, and exhorted to leave the several States to the management
                        of their own domestic institutions in their own way. He was a States' Rights
                        man. If there was no such thing as State Rights, what was the meaning of the
                        inscription on that scroll? [E Pluribus Unum, in the
                        eagle's mouth, over the Speaker's chair.]
                    This measure was to change a fundamental theory of our Government. He did not
                        act from passion and prejudice in this matter. He was constrained to stand
                        on the law-the principle and the facts. He accorded honesty and sincerity to
                        others whilst claiming the same for himself. He took a fearless stand, and
                        would abide by the verdict of time. He did not say that three-fourths of the
                        States could not make a legal amendment to the Constitu-  [Constitu]tion. But he disputed the equity-the
                        right to make the proposed infringements. He deprecated the war policy, but
                        submitted in acquiescence to the laws. He could not admit that rebels have
                        no rights. His policy would be to treat with them, so as to constrain their
                        friendship and secure their confidence. He could not think the end of the
                        war was at hand. This policy would make it interminable. He regretted that
                        there were no Websters of Clays to stand up against it.
                    Mr. MAJOR admitted the strength and point of some of the speeches in
                        opposition to the joint resolution--the speeches of Messrs. Buskirk, Brown
                        and Dunham, in which was the substance of the opposition. The only material
                        point in controversy here was the question of legal right. He read the
                        opinions of Alexander Hamilton and John Quincy Adams declaring the
                        competency of the war power to destroy slavery. He rested the Constitutional
                        argument on the; unanswerable conclusions of the speech of the gentleman
                        from Wabash, last Friday night. But why occupy time in this debate. The
                        subject of slavery in all its aspects had been before the American people
                        from his earliest remembrance,-and men's minds were fixed in the conclusion
                        that the extinction of slavery was right. Its extermination was determined
                        on by the people, and expected by the rebels-by Jeff. Davis himself. Hence
                        he inferred not only that it was right, but that it was expedient and proper
                        to abolish slavery, and that this was the proper time to do it.
                    Mr. LEMON said he was here ten years ago, in just about such a scrape as we
                        have to-day, with this difference-the question was whisky then, it is
                        slavery now. The Maine liquor law was passed with public rejoicings, but
                        very soon afterwards that law was declared to be unconstitutional. But still
                        the world moved on as before. Now we are called upon to amend the
                        Constitution of the United States, and it was demanded with the same popular
                        demonstrations. He admitted the right to amend, but denied the expediency."
                        When the wicked rule the people mourn." He set it down, then, that when the
                        people mourn, the rulers are wicked men. He admired the Constitution of the
                        United States. It was the bond of the Union. There was no other. The
                        Constitution made the Union. To abolish the Constitution was to destroy the
                        Union. Under this Constitution recognizing the institution of slavery, we
                        had prospered eighty years. This institution, which was inherent in the
                        States before the Constitution, could not be rightfully removed by the
                        Federal Power. He referred to the boasting of the gentleman from Wayne, (Mr.
                        Cox,) of having conducted the underground railroad in Eastern Indians giving
                        his vocation the name of stealing. He deprecated the agitation of this
                        question, submitting considerations against its wisdom.
                    To wipe out slavery because of its supposed evil tendencies, was no better
                        than to destroy money and horses to take away temptation from thieves. He
                        showed that slavery was not a sin in the sense of the violation of law in
                        this country. Nor was it condemned by the Divine laws, declared by the
                        highest authority to be holy, just and good. That law authorized the people
                        of Israel to buy servants of the surrounding nations, to serve them forever,
                        and descend as an inheritance to their children; and the Christian
                        institution but confirms the law in this regard. We all had a common
                        interest in this proposition--to change this constitution which the entire
                        officiary of the country were bound .by oath to support; hence he deprecated
                        the haste with which the majority were disposed to pass it here. Would any
                        law be right which sought an existence without the consent of the governed?
                        Then were we going to make this amendment operative on those not consenting
                        to it? But gentlemen say the rebels have deprived themselves of any right of
                        say-so in the matter. And was this a proper time to pass this amendment, at
                        a time when we would bring that portion of our people back to their love and
                        loyalty to the Union.
                    He did not recognise secession. None of the States were out of the Union, and
                        our great work was to bring the rebels back to their former position. But if
                        we change the Constitution fundamentally, we deprive ourselves of all that
                        moral power which right, and the only power which could give success to our
                        efforts. This policy of amendment was most suicidal. He saw not where we are
                        drifting. The flower of the manhood of the country was being destroyed in
                        war whilst we were wrangling here and clamoring for a change of the organic
                        law. He would rather exhort to a restoration of the era of good feeling. But
                        there was little to hope from gentlemen who were not ashamed of political
                        abolition.
                    Mr. GRIFFITH moved that the Committee rise, report progress and ask leave to
                        sit again at 7 o'clock P. M.
                    Mr. BRANHAM would prefer to go into Committee as soon as the special order
                        shall be disposed of. He understood that after a quorum shall have spoken,
                        the remainder of the members were to be expelled. [Laughter.] He would move
                        to sit again at 4 o'clock.
                    Mr. GRIFFITH liked the suggestion, and accepted it as his motion.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK was satisfied that the Contested Elect'on Case would occupy the
                        day.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK moved to sit again at 1 o'clock.
                    It was rejected.
                    Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, proposed to amend Mr. Griffith's motion, by
                        striking out "4. o'clock."
                    After consultation, the modification was agreed to: and then-
                    Mr. Griffith's motion was agreed to, and the Committee rose,and-
                    The CHAIRMAN reported according to the order.
                    The report was concurred in.
                     And then--after an order for an afternoon session at 2 o'clock, moved by Mr.
                        Ollerman--
                     On motion by Mr. WOODS, the House took recess till 2 o'clock P. M.



                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at two o'clock P. M , and directed the
                            Clerk to call the roll of members.
                        The Clerk reported thirty-four members present.
                        
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved a Call of the House. 
                        The motion was agreed to, and the Call of the House was ordered and
                            proceeded.
                        The Clerk reported forty-two members present.
                        The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to read Rules 14 and 15, embracing the
                            order of proceedings in the Call of the House.
                        These rules having been read--
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair has caused these rules to be read, to show that
                            nothing now remains in the orders but to shut the doors. But the Chair
                            is informed that there are a number of members now in conference in the
                            room below. 
                        Mr. KILGORE asked for leave of absence for Mr. Brown--attending
                            court.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB objected.
                        By unanimous consent the names of absentees were called by the Clerk: and
                            thereupon a quorum answered to their names. Whence further proceedings
                            on the call of the House were dispensed with.
                        After debate on the motion for leave of absence for Mr. Brown, in which
                            Messrs. Newcomb, Groves, Boyd, Buskirk, Dunham and otheres participated,
                            the leave was granted without a division.

                        
                            PERSONAL.
                            Mr. KILGORE rose to a question of privilege. Some days ago, when the
                                Morgan raid bill was under consideration, the gentleman from Floyd
                                [Mr. Dunham] stated in his remarks that the ritual of the Order of
                                the Union League required its members to be armed with shot gun and
                                pistol. I, in reply, remarked that the statement was false and
                                untrue. I desire now to make an explanation and an apology to the
                                gentleman from Floyd, as I think it doe to him and to the House. I
                                want to say that the statement was untrue in point of fact-not that
                                the gentleman had told a falsehood. Since that time, I have seen a
                                League ritual of the Order, which does contain a rule precisely as
                                stated by the gentleman from Floyd. It was the ritual of the League
                                along the border, where such a regulation was necessary on account
                                of guerrillas. Such were the facts in the case, and he hoped the
                                gentleman would receive the statement as his apology.
                            Mr. DUNHAM, It afforded him a great deal of pleasure to hear the
                                remarks of the gentlemen from Delaware (Mr. Kilgore.) For from the
                                bottom of his heart, he stated, that he had no other than, the most
                                friendly feelings toward every member of the House. However much
                                gentlemen may differ on political questions, (and he regarded it as
                                right, and but a natural consequence of our manhood that we should
                                differ,) it was his opinion that such difference should never
                                interrupt that courteous and cordial feeling which ought to. obtain
                                with gentlemen on this floor. The reason of this misleading of
                                judgment was not apparent. But the gentlemen must remember that he
                                (Mr. D.) comes from those border counties where these rituals are
                                used. He desired to say farther, that if in anything he had
                                manifested a hasty indiscretion, it was not because he desired
                                controversy, but it was in compliance with the innate feelings of
                                every man's heart in this House to insist on that courtesy which is
                                due to him as a Representative, and to his constituents. There was
                                nothing belligerent in his character. The gentleman from Marion was
                                wrong in that guess. Why, there, was not an infant child in his
                                county but would crow in his presence, and not a do, but wags his
                                tail when, he passes by.-[Laughter ] And certainly he should
                                continue to greet gentlemen here on all sides with the utmost
                                cordiality on all occasions.
                        

                        
                            THE PUTNAM CONTESTS.
                            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: the Putnam county
                                contested election case.
                            Mr. LASSELLE, from the minority of the Committee on
                                    Elections, submitted a report, dissenting from the
                                report of the majority of the committee, reporting the opinion that
                                the Cloverdale vote should not be rejected, referring to the law
                                governing the case, canvassing the illegal minor and non-resident
                                voters, and giving an abstract of the entire vote for
                                Representatives in Putham county, closing with a resolution alleging
                                that Austin M. Puett and Samuel Colover were duly elected
                                Representatives of Putnam county, and as such entitled to hold their
                                seats in this House.
                            [Here Mr. RHOADS asked and obtained unanimous consent to report a
                                bill from the Committee on Education, which
                                (without reading) was laid on the table, and 300 copies thereof
                                ordered to be printed ]
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the two negative resolutions reported by the
                                majority of the Committee be laid on the table because they were not
                                called for since we have a minority report. 
                            Mr. NEWCOMB thought the negative resolutions were necessary, and
                                ought to be retained.
                            The motion was rejected.
                            Mr. KILGORE. The testimony from which the majority report was derived
                                is voluminous, and it was expected that the report would be received
                                without a strict examination of the testimony. This report was
                                expected to be regarded as a precedent, and for this reason it was
                                made without any reference to party feeling. The contestors were
                                wholly exonerated from complicity in wrong doing. There were but two
                                points in the report. One with regard to the vote in Cloverdale
                                township and the mail-conduct of those who managed them after the
                                polls were closed, and the other having reference to illegal
                                votes.
                            So far as Messrs, Puett and Colovar were concerned, they stood
                                unimpeached with any complicity in any fraudulent transactions
                                whatever in the regard. They certainly were not accused by any one
                                of lending any countenance to any fraud, either during the balloting
                                or after the polls were closed, calculated to promote returns in
                                their favor. Both of them were honorable men, and if frauds had been
                                perpetrated by their party friends, or by others, It was because
                                bets had been made and it was desired to win. Cloverdale township
                                had to decide the matter.
                            There it was, in that township, that the outrage had been perpetrated
                                upon the ballot-box in Putnam. Men named Scott and Davis were
                                implicated, in fact convicted, before the committee in this matter.
                                Mr. Kilgore went fur- [fur]ther
                                in the debate, making an able argument in favor of the majority
                                report which ousts Messrs. Puett and Colover, and installs Messrs.
                                Lane and Hamrick, if the House endorses it.
                            Some action must be taken to prevent hereafter such conduct on the
                                part of those engaged in elections as had occurred in this
                                Cloverdale township, Patnam county, The time had been reached, long
                                since, when greater security should be thrown around the ballot-box;
                                this present instance only verified the necessity; and, therefore,
                                this House was called upon to act conscientiously, impartially, and
                                promptly. The committee found that, taking everything into
                                consideration, Mr. Lane had a majority of 35, and Mr. Hamrick a
                                majority of 1, respectively, over their opponents.
                            Mr. LASSELLE followed in support of the minority report. While he
                                admitted that the cpntestees had produced some facts on their side,
                                still he was not prepared to say that fraud had been developed. The
                                great stress was laid on the adjournment of the judges, with
                                attendant circumstances. But the law expressly authorized these
                                judges to adjourn as they did. From all the testimony developed in
                                this connection no fraud had been shown on the part of the
                                contestees. He made the declaration boldly, and challenged
                                contradiction, that there was no presumptive fraud upon the ballot
                                box perpetrated and none contemplated. Reviewing the whole subject
                                Mr. Lasselle said that as this was in some sort a criminal case, we
                                ought to be careful in deciding. We should not find fraud unless it
                                was clearly demonstrated.
                            As to throwing out the ballots of Cloverdale township-that could not
                                be done, and the legal voters deprived of their suffrages, because
                                of the irregularity of a few voters, or the misconduct of any
                                officer, even if such irregularity of misconduct, had been proved to
                                exist.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH followed, saying that perhaps he differed from the
                                majority of the committee, on one or two votes. He had deducted one
                                vote purporting to be cast for Messrs. Lane and Hamrick; but in
                                figuring up, it made no difference. Messrs. Lane and Hamrick were in
                                his judgment elected by the majorities reported by the committee. He
                                concluded, saying that the contestants ought to be admitted to seats
                                on this floor.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB followed in support of the majority report. Allowance
                                might be made for every doubtful vote, and still Mr. Lane would be
                                found to be elected. We must put some limit on rascality in
                                elections, or shortly we would have no elections at all. The
                                gentleman argued the question at great length, analyzing the
                                testimony, and insisting, upon his side of the question, the right
                                of Messrs. Lane and Hamrick to seats as Representatives from Patnam,
                                as against Messrs. Puett and Colover.
                            He argued in favor of the right of students at college (in this
                                instance, of the students in the Greencastle institution) to vote.
                                Certainly, these students, although they might keep bachelor's hall,
                                ought to be admitted to the same footing as regards the right of
                                suffrage, as the individual from Ireland who worked on a railroad,
                                and who in one month, or ten, or two days, or one day, even, might
                                be far away from the precinct in which he ballotted. It was clear
                                that these students were legal voters-15 of them. Their votes was
                                just as legal as any vote he ever cast. But throwing them out and he
                                stood ready to throw them out, if it was necessary-Mr. Lane was
                                still elected, according to the report of the committee by eleven
                                votes, and Mr. Hamrick by one vote. This thing roust be ascertained,
                                for the time was come to throw by legislative action, additional
                                safeguards around the sanctity of the ballot box.
                            Mr. PUETT followed in defense of his and his colleague's right to
                                their seats. He analyzed the testimony. He went into the statistics
                                relating to suffrage in his county. He demonstrated, from his point
                                of view, that if frauds were committed in Putnam county, Republicans
                                had been guilty. What man, however, was there that would come here
                                and say that these frauds had been committed with the knowledge of
                                the judges and inspectors? Would any one of the ninety-five men who
                                testified that they voted for Lane and Hamrick, say so?
                            As high-toned a gentleman as ever lived (Mr. Davis,) would testify
                                that no man had ever tampered with the ballot-box in Cloverdale
                                township.
                            He thought, if an impartial view of the case was taken, such as was
                                due from one man to another, this thing could be easily reconciled.
                                Ninety-five men came here and testified that they had voted for
                                Messrs. Lane and Hamrick, when the highest vote the township had
                                cast since 1862 was only 82. Taking the testimony, taking the record
                                altogether, he could not believe the ballot box had, in the
                                township, ever been tampered with. Soldiers' votes were not
                                challenged, although they might have voted when not entitled.
                            For himself he would rather be beaten than to dispute the right of
                                the man to vote who was serving his country in the field. However,
                                the soldiers, or persons dressed in soldiers' clothes, whose true
                                names were Bedel and Keppel, had voted under the names of Smith and
                                Brown--had voted the Union ticket; at least, Governor Morton's name
                                was at the head of the tickets they voted.
                            But the gentleman said there had been no fair election in Putnam. Let
                                us, then, go before the people again, and then you would see, if
                                nobody interfered with us, who had the majority. He had been a
                                candidate without his consent, and only on the understanding that,
                                if he is turned out of his seat, the matter should be tried over, he
                                would become a candidate again. 
                            Did you ever see a student-so much talked of by Mr. Newcomb in
                                favorable comparison with the Irishman-did you ever see a student
                                that was a tax-payer, that ever paid anything towards the support of
                                the country? You never did, yet on election day, from nineteen years
                                old and upwards, they were all at the polls. He did not wish to see
                                any man voting unless he was legally entitled. He would to God we
                                had an efficient law to protect the purity o t ballot box. Putnam
                                was a Democratic county.
                            Gentlemen would find it out if, as he proposed if they ousted him, if
                                they would try it over again.
                                Mr. Lincoln, he took it, was about the strongest man on the
                                Republican ticket, yet in Putnam he was 187 behind.
                            On motion of Mr. Newcomb, Messrs. Lane and Hamrick, contestants, were
                                allowed to address the House, at such times during the discussion as
                                might be convenient for them.
                        

                        
                            THE STATES' QUOTA. 
                            [Here a message was receieved from the Senate, by Mr. Whittlesey,
                                their Secretary, announcing the passage in that body of a concurrent
                                resolution asking the President of the United States to extend
                                further time of thirty days to the State of Indiana to fill her
                                quota under the late call for volunteers.]
                            Whereupon (by unanimous consent), on motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the
                                concurrent resolution was considered and adopted. 
                            Mr. BUSKIRK combatted the positions of the gentleman from Delaware,
                                (Mr. Kilgore,) and the gentleman from Marion (Mr. Newcomb,) relative
                                to throwing out the vote of Cloverdale township, and insisted upon
                                the purity of the ballot-box, which he hoped would have additional
                                safeguards.
                             Mr. RHOADS demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK said he was ready to take a vote upon Mr. Lane's case,
                                but for Mr. Colover's we were not yet ready. He was here trying to
                                get along in good faith, and if the previous question related only
                                to Mr. Lane's case, a vote might be had immediately. But if it was
                                insisted that Mr. Colover's be included, he would move an
                                adjournment, and demand the yeas and nays.
                            After sundry explanations, (by consent,) in which Mr. Newcomb, Mr.
                                Buskirk, and Mr. Gregory, of Warren, participated, the motion to
                                adjourned was withdrawn.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved that that portion of the two reports,
                                so far as the contest of Mr. Hamrick is concerned, be referred again
                                to the Committee on Elections.
                            Finally it was agreed to take a vote as between Messrs. Lane and
                                Puett--the resolution being that Mr. Lane was entitled to the seat
                                from Putnam.
                            There was then a second for the previous question.
                            The first branch of the main question, viz: the adoption of the
                                resolution ot the minority report, that Mr. Puett was legally
                                elected, was rejected.
                            The question was then taken on the first and third resolutions
                                reported by the majority of the Committee on
                                    Elections, viz: declaring Mr. Line elected, and Mr.
                                Puett not elected.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                                resulted-yeas 55, nays 28-as follows:

                         NIGHT SESSION.
                        The House met at 7:15 P. M.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the House resolved into Committee of
                                the Whole--Mr. Henricks in the Chair--and the
                                Committee of the Whole took up the consideration
                            of the Executive message and the joint resolution from the Senate, No. 16, proposing to ratify the
                            Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, recently submitted
                            by Congress to the Legislatures of the several States for their
                            concurrence.
                        Mr. FERRIS must confess that, up to the time of the consideration of this
                            subject, he had not properly appreciated the honor of the position of a
                            Representative on this floor. He was willing to make any sacrifice for
                            the privilege of aiding by his vote on this floor in absolving this
                            country from the curse of slavery. There were bat two questions involved
                            in this joint resolution: Is it right? Is it expedient? The debate had
                            been confined to the questions of State, sovereignty and freedom. He
                            should confine himself to the former. Vattel says that a State is
                            sovereign; it has the right to govern itself, independent, of any other
                            sovereign power. These Colonies absolved themselves from the control of
                            the British crown. They achieved their sovereignty in that seven years'
                            war. Shortly after they formed the league of the confederation.
                        He read the preamble to the Article of Confederation. In the second
                            article it was declared that these States reserve their sovereignty; but
                            when the powers of the world would not recognize the ministers of that
                            confederacy, the States found their league insufficient for nationality,
                            and then they proceeded, through a Constitutional Convention, to form a
                            more perfect Union. The confederation was formed by the delegates of the
                            States. The Constitution of the United States was the work of "We, the
                            People." He showed by the Constitution itself that these States
                            delegated every particle of their sovereignty. The 2d clause of the 6th
                            article declares that "this Constitution and the laws of the United
                            States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made,
                            or which shall be made under the authority of the United Spates, shall
                            be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be
                            bound thereby, anything in the 
                            Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.""
                        Could a State law, under that clause, pass a supreme law? No, sir. And
                            the judges of every State are bound by that, anything in the
                            Constitution and laws of their respective States notwithstanding. Again,
                            there were certain ingredients that go to make up sovereignty in a
                            State. It is also declared that no State shall coin money, emit bills of
                            credit, declare war, make treaties, &c.--to every intent and purpose
                            they shall not exercise the functions of a sovereignty. The only thing
                            reserved is the right to manage their municipal affairs. These doctrines
                            of State rights date back to the origin of the Government. Alexander
                            Hamilton, John Jay, and others understood that General Constitution.
                            Their writings, authorized by the Convention, were first published under
                            the name of "Publics." They declare in the second and third numbers, of
                            "The Federalist" that there were parties then striving to divide the
                            country into two "Confederacies." That was the word they used. But
                            Buchanan could not find power in the Constitution to coerce a State.
                        Mr. Hamilton found two cases in which this power could be exercised-by
                            law and by the sword. The next principle involved in this debate was
                            negro equality. Gentlemen contended, that if this amendment were right,
                            it was not expedient because of the tendency to equality. Just so far as
                            the Declaration of Independence gave quality, he was not afraid to
                            accord it. So far as his observation went, amalgamation of the races
                            pertained rather to slavery than freedom. Had not God created men
                            equal-in a political sense he meant? The idea of social equality was
                            absurd, even when confined to the white race. Was the distinction to be
                            confined to color? Why, there were slaves as white as you or I. The
                            gentleman from Monroe had said we were at the wrong end of this
                            work-beginning at the apex of the structure. He believed we were
                            striking at the foundation. The Committee on Seals In
                            the original Constitutional Convention reported for a design for a seal
                            the idea-the figure of a broken pillar.
                        In the sense of putting on the topmost stone thereof, we might, perhaps,
                            be at work now at the apex. It was like the stone in Salomon's temple
                            "which the builders rejected," which "became the head of the corner."
                            That keystone in the arch of freedom which these Democratic, builders
                            have go long rejected, has indeed become the head of the corner. And he
                            would close in the solemn words addressed in another age and to another
                            people by that Divine man, to whose words it were the wisdom of all to
                            take heed, that "whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken;
                            but upon whosoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
                        Mr. BUSKIRK should as for as possible confine his remarks to what had
                            been offered by the gentleman from Wabash [Mr. Pettit] and others, by
                            way of controverting the positions which he assumed in the opening, of
                            this debate. He had assumed, first, that the increase of powers claimed
                            by the adoption of the proposed amendment, will result in a virtual
                            change of our form of government 2. It will be an impediment in the way
                            of the restoration of the Union. 3. It he voted for the amendment, he
                            should be constrained to follow out the principle to its natural,
                            logical and legitimate results, and give to the African race the rights
                            guaranteed by it, and elevate them to the character and position of
                            citizens of the Commonwealth.
                        These were the positions he had already assumed. Too much true had been
                            given in this debate to mere political and personal questions. It was
                            but a brief space of time for which he asked the indulgence of the
                            committee. He stated the other day the divergence between Hamilton,
                            Jefferson and Madison-the leaders in the organization of this
                            Government. The gentleman from Wabash alleged that there was not these
                            distinctions between, them which he had pointel cut. He read from
                            Yates's Convention Debates, extracts from the speech of Mr. Martin, of
                            Maryland, to sustain the distinctions he had Md/lown between the plans
                            proposed by Hamilton and Madison-the New Jersey plan, and the Virginia
                            plan. Mr. Hamilton wanted a President and Senators for life-that the
                            State Governor should be appointed by the President of the United
                            States, &c. He read from a speech by Mr. Hamilton, contending for a
                            National Government completely sovereign. And he thereupon, submitted
                            whether he or the gentleman from Wabash was right He had sustained the
                            truth of history in his former statements. He had asserted also that
                            this was but a renewal of the old contest.
                         The gentleman said we had no right to the style of Jeffersonian
                            Democrats. He read from the first democratic platform, written for the
                            original organization of the party, embodying the foregoing
                            distinctions-that platform upon which. Mr. Jefferson was elected to the
                            Presidency in 1800. But the gentlemen said that it was the purpose of
                            the convention to make slavery universal. He submitted that then all the
                            States but one were slave States; and there were three provisions in the
                            constitution recognizing slavery. Would they have placed these in that
                            instrument if they had intended by the constitution to make freedom
                            universal? He had called on gentlemen to give an instance Wherein the
                            Federal Government had ever attempted to interfere with the domestic
                            institutions of a State.
                        The gentleman from Wabash, in reply, read from the act to enable the
                            Territory of Indiana to form a Constitution and State Government. The
                            instance the gentleman gave did not sustain him. He read from the
                            ordinance of 1787--that those articles shall be an agreement between the
                            original States and the people of the Northwest. The 5th article was the
                            one prohibiting slavery. Now, if Congress had held the power to prohibit
                            slavery, would they have made it a point of agreement? But then,
                            notwithstanding this, the Territorial Legislature established a system
                            of apprenticeship, which was slavery to all intents and purposes. The
                            Territorial Legislature petitioned Congress for a repeal of that clause
                            of the agreement, which was reported against by John Randolph; and at
                            the time of the adoption of the first State Constitituion, that
                            Convention of the people  [peo]ple
                            of the State of Indiana was within one vote of authorizing slavery. He
                            then looked at the Constitutionality of this joint resolution. He
                            conceded the power according to the strict letter of the Constitution,
                            but its exercise was in contravention of the spirit of the Constitution. 
                        If the gentleman from Ripley, (Mr. Ferris,)had considered a little he
                            would have remembered that Vattel is not very good authority in this
                            country. He might very well be read for authority in the Old World. Our
                            theory of government makes the people the sovereign of all governmental
                            power. At the very point where State sovereignty ends, the sovereignty
                            of the General Government begins. He read from Chief Justice Story, in
                            the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, in convention
                            of the position of Mr. Ferris, that the States had delegated all their
                            sovereignty; showing that these powers remain as they were before the
                            Constitution was adopted, except in so far as they were abridged by that
                            instrument. Our Government was peculiar in form. The States delegated
                            powers, and the General Government guaranteed to the States a Republican
                            form of government. Could there be a Republican government without the
                            attribute of sovereignty?
                        He showed that every one of these slavery clauses in the Constitution was
                            the result of compromise. What did New England get for this? They should
                            not pay duties on trade with the several States. If they now strike down
                            the Southern consideration in this compromise, should they not, in
                            common honesty, give up their commercial advantages which had made them
                            rich? He read from Chief Justice Story to the same effect, showing also
                            that this compromise was a condition precedent to the formation of the
                            Constitution. He read from Mr. Justice Thompson and Mr. Justice Wayne to
                            the same effect not a mere guarantee, but a great national engagement.
                            He read also from Mr. Justice McLean. Mr. Pinckney, of South Carolina
                            was also quoted to the same effect. Luther Martin also, to the same
                            matter.
                        The New England States, looking after their own interests, entered into a
                            compromise-a great national engagement-that was carried into the
                            constitution, and now they come up and ask to have the Southern
                            consideration struck down. The Northern States made their money out of
                            the African slave trade, and when they could no longer make money out of
                            it, they turn up their eyes in holy horror against it.--[Cheers ] How
                            was it in the case of the Louisiana Territory? There was a difficulty
                            also there. He read from the Louisiana treaty of cession. A treaty has
                            the same legal force and authority, as the constitution itself,
                            therefore John Quincy Adams voted for Arkansas to come into the Union as
                            a slave State. He regretted that it was "in the bond," but acquiesced in
                            its authority and voted for the admission. Were gentlemen here, as a
                            party, acting in good faith? No, sir; they were following New
                            England.
                        They had thrown off all disgaise, and declared openly for the destruction
                            of slavery. He read from Mr. Lincoln's inaugural address, and Mr.
                            Steward's latter to Mr. Adams, showing that the institution of slavery
                            would remain the same in these States whether the revolution succeed or
                            fail. Then what did Congress? They adopted the resolution that-the war
                            was not waged far conquest nor far subjugation, nor for overturning the
                            rights of States, but that the rights, the equality and institutions of
                            the States were to remain unimpaired. Now gentlemen change their policy,
                            and denounce any man that will not follow them. The gentleman from
                            Wabash said this power of amendment was without limit. Concede it, and
                            how soon shall we have an established church, and the realization of all
                            the dogmas of Alexander Hamilton?
                        The gentleman was losing the moral power of this question. He referred to
                            the allegation by the gentleman from Lawrence (Mr. Boyd,) that he (Mr.
                            B.) had voted against a motion to lay on the table a certain resolution
                            offered by the gentleman from Sullivan at the last session of the
                            General Assembly. But did not that gentleman know that for him to have
                            voted otherwise would have been in violation of a rule of the House
                            requiring all such propositions to go to the Committee on Federal
                            Relations?--a rule which had been introduced by a Republican, and
                            adopted by a Republican Legislature. He proceeded to defend the
                            Democratic party from onslaughts made in this debate. He should not
                            answer charges against his own loyalty. His record should answer that.
                            He referred to the action of the Democratic party in the Charleston
                            Convention. They would not submit to the sectional demands of the
                            Southern delegates.
                        They came borne and fought the battle of popular sovereignty and
                            non-intervention, which, if it had Succeeded, would have saved the
                            country from war. They battled with an energy worthy of the cause, but
                            were defeated by the southern and northern sectionalists. That
                            combination of Republicans and Breckinridge men ought to make gentlemen
                            a little tender on this subject. Even after Stumter was destroyed, the
                            President, his Cabinet and their newspapers were in doubt, leaning to
                            secession which their selfishness and duplicity had invited. Who then
                            came to the aid of the President? The mouth-piece of the Democratic
                            party-Stephen A. Douglas. That was the first support which Mr. Lincoln
                            received in the war. Aye, what had the Democratic party not done for the
                            war? Were our Democratic counties behind in their quotas? But then,
                            notwithstanding our readiness and efficiency in raising men and raising
                            means for the army, we have had nearly all our public and private rights
                            taken away from us.
                        Our newspapers have been suppressed, our persons confined in dungeons
                            without legal process, without the right of habeas corpus, and
                            discharged without trial. He referred to language used in this debate
                            that had fallen strangely on our ears. What said the gentleman from
                            Wayne, (Mr. Cox,) the conductor on the underground railroad? and what
                            said the gentleman from Henry, (Mr. Chambers?) We had fallen on evil
                            times. The gentleman from Wayne avowed that he had violated the
                            Constitution and the laws of Congress. The gentleman vaunted that his
                            time had come to sail  with the
                            tide, now, with the passage of this measure, curiously supposed to be
                            the extinction of slavery consummated. And the gentleman from Henry had
                            said if it had not been for this power of peaceful amendment of the
                            Constitution the Abolitionists would have been the first rebels, and he
                            would have joined them! and these sentiments were applauded to the echo
                            from the floor and the lobbies of this House. He read from a speech by a
                            Republican State Elector in 1864, the Hon. Richard W. Thompson, by way
                            of advice to the Abolitionists of to-day.
                        Mr. SIM interposing. Does not the gentleman know that ninety-nine out of
                            every hundred of the Republican party deprecated all interference with
                            slavery in the States where it existed?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. Aye, but how did they manifest it? They organized an
                            abolition party in 1839 and 1843, disclaiming in their platforms that
                            they would commit perjury--that they would disregard the oaths of office
                            to subserve their notions of a quaisi philanthropy? And when the old
                            Whig party was destroyed--(would to God it had lived, notwithstanding
                            its errors) they organised by another Convention in Philadelphia, upon
                            these sectional platforms: and when we told them what would follow, we
                            were called "Union savers" But they went on--they agitated--and the war
                            came, and still they agitated. He read further from Colonel Thompson's
                            speech. This man gave a truthful history and a just denunciation of this
                            party in 1855; but sooth to say, he turned to do the same thing himself.
                            The gentleman from Wabash used a new term, which he (Mr. B.) did not
                            like-speaking o what would be done in "the new Union." He wanted no
                            "flag but the old one. He wanted no new Union. He did not like the word
                            "re-construction." He liked "restoration" better. He concluded in the
                            closing words of Mr. Webster's famous anti-Nullification speech in the
                            Senate of the United States.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE did not purpose to enter upon a lengthy argument. The
                            lateness of the hour, and the public anxiety to hear the result of this
                            prolonged discussion forbade it. He had read the plausible argument
                            delivered by George H. Pendleton, the late candidate for the position of
                            Vice President, and had felt a curiosity to know its merits under the
                            favorable circumstances of being delivered by an orator of the
                            accomplishments of the gentleman from Monroe. He must confess that the
                            gentleman's elocution heightened its effect. The gentleman complained
                            that he and his party had been met with epithets instead of argument
                            during this discussion. They had been stigmatized as traitors. He had
                            been an attentive listener through the whole debate, and yet be had not
                            heard a single epithet applied by a Union member to the gentleman or his
                            party friends. He would not pause to ask who and who were not traitors
                            upon this floor of the House, but he would ask why the gentleman, after
                            arraigning Union members on the charge of descending from the decorum of
                            debate to personal accusations, had here in the presence of this large
                            audience, turned aside himself from the line of honest argument with
                            these charges fresh upon his own lips to brand a young member'of the
                            House with being a rebel and a traitor.
                        The distinguished gentleman had better rid himself of guilt of applying
                            epithets before he branded others. It had been vauntingly heralded that
                            the speech of the gentleman would be a reply to the argument of the
                            gentleman from Wabash (Mr. Pettit) The audience could judge whether he
                            had accomplished that difficult undertaking. He would say that he had
                            failed not so much perhaps from lack of talent, as from the fact that he
                            and his party occupied grounds on this question beyond human ability to
                            defend. Their position was Constitutionally and morally false, and no
                            human logic or ingenuity could maintain it. Passing from these
                            considerations he would ask what was the occasion of so much public
                            interest in the deliberations of the House as was manifested by the
                            presence of such a vast throng of the people. The impressive scene
                            presented was sufficient of itself to characterize the proceeding as one
                            of immense importance, but when it became known that the purpose was to
                            amend the great Charter of American liberty, public curiosity was
                            partially explained but entirely explained when it was understood that
                            it was proposed to so amend the American Constitution as to forever
                            destroy American slavery.
                        Nice deductions had been made, subtle argument adduced, upon the subject
                            of delegated and reserved powers-a mass of refinements about Federal and
                            State power had been evolved; yet, beyond and below all this learning
                            lies the great fundamental truth, that the people made the government,
                            both State and national, marked out the spheres of their operations, and
                            lodged powers, in one or the other, consistent with the purposes for
                            which they were created. The gentleman from Monroe had talked of State
                            rights, as if the rights of States were inalienable, as if they had been
                            fixed by the decrees of Providence-something established by the
                            unalterable laws of nature. The only to alienable rights of which he had
                            any knowledge was the right of every man, black or white, on God's green
                            earth, to eat the bread won by the sweat of his own brow, and i he was
                            upon that branch of the subject, would pause to remind the gentleman
                            from Monroe that, nevertheless, Providence, through a mysterious
                            partiality, had gifted him with a fair skin, his right to life, liberty
                            and the pursuit of happiness, was no more sacred than that of the
                            blackest negro goaded to the toil of a slave upon the plantations of the
                            South.
                        Returning to the doctrine of Stats Rights, he contended that the State
                            was simply a part of one grand system of government, extending from
                            committees up to the national organization-all the parts-county, State
                            and Federal Government, being made by the people mainly for the purpose
                            of establishing justice and. securing public tranquility. What the
                            people had made they could unmake. State rights were the gift of the
                            people; natural rights were the gift of the Creator. Nobody could go
                            beyond him in contending for the steady maintenance of all
                            constitutional limitations, so as to prevent encroachment of either
                            Government upon the other, and more especially of the Federal  upon the State, but he would
                            denounce as fallacious and wicked the idolaltry of State rights, as if
                            they were of divine origin. The gentleman's chief concern is for the
                            safety of State rights. The Federal Government might go down in the
                            terrible rebellion now drenching the continent with fraternal blood-the
                            bondage of millions of people should continue, loading down with
                            suffering and sorrow an unforunate race-slavery should be perpetuated
                            though it should sink the nation, because to preserve the one and
                            destroy the other are incompatible with State rights. Monstrous
                            doctrine. The State had no rights inconsistent with the liberty of the
                            people and perpetuity of the American Union. What was a State for? To
                            help the National Government protect the people living in it. When it
                            ceases to do this, either directly or indirectly, impelled by either
                            external or internal causes, seeks to rise cut of its sphere and to
                            encroach upon Federal rights, it should at once be subordinated to its
                            place by all constitutional means. He would bring this question of
                            constitutional limitations upon Federal and State government to a point
                            by earning more directly the consideration of the resolution before the
                            House. The Federal Government had proposed an amendment abolishing
                            slavery throughout the United States. The States were called upon to
                            ratify. Indiana was pausing now in the midst of her legislation for
                            domestic purposes, deliberating upon whether she would give her consent
                            or not. The gentleman had combatted this move as if it was an arrogation
                            of undelegated power by the National Government. It bad been asserted
                            that the States were being robbed of their reserved rights by
                            Congressional interference. How stood the facts? Congress had simply
                            proposed an amendment to the Federal Constitution, and the country was
                            awaiting the action of the people, through their State organizations,
                            upon this modification of their National Government. Was this an
                            assumption of power?
                        He appealed to the instrument itself. "Congress, whenever two-thirds of
                            both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this
                            Constitution, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part
                            of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourtbs
                            of the several States." Here was the constitutional guaranty for this
                            move to strike down a monster wrong, disenthrall a whole race, and save
                            the nation from the sin of laying violent hands upon the liberties of
                            the unfortunate black man. Did the gentleman desire other
                            guaranties?--he cited him to the absolute, inalienable rights of human
                            nature, which no man, no party, no state, and no nation, could trample
                            upon with impunity, without being sooner or later pushed to the wall. If
                            constitutions were framed in disregard of the eternal, unalterable rules
                            of justice: if the people did not amend them, when the pressure came, as
                            it would inevitably come, the fires of a revolution would burn them to
                            lifeless ashes. Parchment must always through all-coming time yield to
                            principle it was in the very nature of things Parchment was
                            perishable-principle, eternal and imperishable.
                        The time had now come in the life of this great nation for it to yield
                            its barbarous hold15upon the inalienable liberties of four millions of
                            men. The lessons of the hour, the terrible experience of the
                            slaveholders' rebellion, four years of war with its long train of sad
                            and mournful concomitants all demonstrated the terrible mistake of
                            continuing longer to commit the national sin which had well nigh
                            overwhelmed and sunk cut of sight the American Union in the blood of its
                            own citizens. We must conform to the spirit of the age, our Constitution
                            must give way to the progress of things. The gentleman from Monroe, (Mr.
                            Buskirk,) had asserted that Congress had no power to interfere with the
                            domestic institutions of a State. He agreed with the gentleman if he
                            meant by that. Congress alone could not abolish slavery in the
                            States.
                        This was clearly not an attempt of that kind, This was the constitutional
                            method of the people, the supreme rulers of the land, to strike the
                            chains from the limbs of every slave upon American soil. Had they not
                            the power? It was claimed that the States made the Union, instead of the
                            people in their aggregate capacity-that the States were older than the
                            Union. Neither of these propositions were true. The first proposition
                            was an exploded political fallacy, and the second melted away in the
                            light of a superficial knowledge of history. Was Indiana older than the
                            Union?--was Missouri?--was Kentucky?--was Arkansas? But suppose they
                            were-admitting that all the States existed before the Union-and that the
                            Constitution was the creature of the States, had they not agreed, when
                            ratifying the Constitution, that two-thirds of Congress, with
                            three-fourths of the States, could amend that instrument? Was not the
                            dissenting one-fourth bound to submit. He demanded that they should
                            stand by the great bargain. It was so written in the bond. Let them
                            stand by their contract. It could not be said truthfully that the
                            one-fourth of the States refusing to ratify an amendment to the
                            Constitution, consistent with its letter and spirit, and which did not
                            trench upon the domain of individual liberty, had never consented to
                            such an amendment. They had consented to every amendment of that
                            instrument within the bounds mentioned by him, which should be proposed
                            by two-thirds of Congress and sanctioned by three-fourths of the
                            States.
                        It could not be said as a legal proposition,. that the one-fourth had
                            never consented to such an amendment so made. This brought him to the
                            proposition contained in the interrogatory go defiantly flung out by the
                            gentleman from Monroe: Can Congress, with three-fourths of the States
                            ratifying fasten slavery upon every State of the Union? and if not, how
                            can it and such a number of the States destroy slavery in the States
                            where it exists? He would answer the gentleman frankly that Congress and
                            the States had no such power, not so much because of constitutional
                            restrictions as from a law higher than all constitutions. All political
                            power was limited by individual liberty. The power to make a slave a
                            freeman was a very different proposition from that of making a freeman a
                            slave. The power to enslave did not; exist rightfully anywhere-the power
                            to disenthrall from the chains of bondage existed everywhere. It was
                            claimed that the letter of the 
                            Constitution perhaps, did not not prohibit this amendment, but that the
                            spirit did. The spirit of the instrument was to establish justice and
                            secure domestic tranquillity. This amendment would do both. The
                            liberties of millions of men long and cruelly withheld would be
                            restored, an I the great Government of the American Union would be
                            brought back in harmony with these fixed laws of natural justice, for
                            the violation of which it had been paying a dreadful penalty. The move
                            to amend the Constitution ought not to be considered novel and
                            surprising.
                        It must necessarily come about in the course and progress of society,
                            that constitutions as well as laws should be changed to suit the
                            commercial, political and other changes which inevitably take place. The
                            Constitution of the United States, though an admirable document, clear
                            and elegant in its language, and far reaching in the sagacity of its
                            principles-in so far at least as securing domestic tranquility was
                            concerned, had proven a failure for five years of its history. These
                            remarks should not be construed into a disrespect for the character and
                            wisdom of the men who made that great instrument. He entertained a high
                            veneration for the great powers of Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson, and the
                            other gifted authors of the Magna Charter of American liberties. The
                            abort learnings of that instrument, which experience had proved to every
                            school boy in the land, was not to be attributed so much to lack of
                            political sagacity of the men who made it, as to the clashing interests
                            of the times and people for which it was made. The Federalist, the
                            product of the combined wisdom of Hamilton, Madison and Jefferson, fresh
                            from the labors of their immortal task, was after all but an apology for
                            what was conceived to be defects in this great constitutional plan. But
                            he would not delay the House longer, except to refer to one other
                            point.
                        He referred to what had been said upon Congressional interference in the
                            status of the inhabitants of States. He would not undertake to say how
                            much that question affected the one before the House, but it had been
                            asserted here that Congress excluded slavery from the Northwest
                            territory because Virginia in her deed of cession had imposed that
                            condition. This was not true the slightest acquaintance with history,
                            would discover that no such condition was imposed. Again he would put it
                            to the gentleman from Monroe, if it had ever occurred to him that when
                            the deed of cession was executed by her, she had no title to the
                            Northwest territory?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It is certainly news to me that Virginia had no title.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. If the gentleman will take the trouble of a little
                            research into authentic history, he will perhaps make the discovery that
                            Virginia had no title. She once had it, or claimed it, before an English
                            court, and it had been set aside. She executed a quit claim, it is true,
                            but Congress never recognized her title further than to accept that quit
                            claim. But this was, at best, somewhat foreign to the issue.
                        Mr. BOYD interposed, and Mr. W. gave way for him to respond to that
                            portion of the remarks of Mr. Buskirk which referred to him He denied
                            that Mr. Buskirk was restrained from voting to lay a disloyal resolution
                            on the table by a rule of the House of 1863, requiring such propositions
                            to be referred to the Committee on Federal Relations
                            without debate. He found also from the journal of that session where Mr.
                            B. had voted for a resolution, "condemning and denouncing arbitrary
                            arrests, as tyrannical and in flagrant violation of the rights of the
                            people, unwarranted by the Constitution, and hereby demanding that all
                            each arrests shall hereafter case." He (Mr. Boyd) justified those
                            arrests, from a reference which he made particularly to the conduct of
                            Democrats in the Newburg raid, and from testimony before the Grand Jury
                            of the United States District Court with reference to the signs and
                            grips understood in common by rebel prisoners from Louisiana, and
                            Democrats and he alleged that they were rightfully made, and that there
                            should have been more of them.
                        He would not allow himself to trespass farther on the time of the
                            gentleman from Wabash and Kosciusko, and closed wishing he had about
                            half an hour at the gentleman from Monroe.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK wished the gentleman from Lawrence had time to understand the
                            journal.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. Inasmuch as he was the mover of the original resolution
                            before the House upon this subject, the courtesy of debate seemed to
                            accord to him the closing of the argument. He would, therefore, move
                            that the committee do now rise, report Senate bill No 16, ratifying the
                            amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United
                            States, and back to the House, with the recommendation that it pass.
                        The motion was agreed to, and thereupon the Committee rose, and-
                        The CHAIRMAN reported accordingly.
                        The SPEAKER stated the question to be on the third reading of. the joint
                            resolution. The joint resolution was then ordered to the third reading,
                            and read the third time by the Clerk.
                        Mr. BIRD desired to offer an amendment.
                        VOICES. "Object," "object."
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said he understood that the proposition of the gentleman from
                            Allen was, that the joint resolution be recommitted to Committee on the
                            Judiciary with instructions. 
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair has relied on rule 59 for the decision that
                            propositions cannot be recommitted at this stage. 
                        Mr. HIGGINS and Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested the understanding that gentlemen now absent be
                            allowed allowed on this proposition when they return.
                        VOICES. "Consent."


                         The yeas and nays were then order and taken, resulting-yeas 56, nays 29,
                            as follows:

                                        and Mr. Speaker.
                                     NAYS--Messrs. Bird, Burwell, Buskirk, Coffroth, Collins,
                                        Colover, Croan, Glazebrook, Gregg, Hargrove, Harrison,
                                        Howard, Humphreys, Hunt, Lasselle, Lemon, Lopp, Miller, of

                        So the question passed the House of Represenatatives, and the title was
                            reported by the Clerk, and authenticated amid shouts of irrepresible
                            applause from the floor and the lobbies. And immediately there was the
                            response of a concerted national salute booming southward from the front
                            of the Capitol.
                         Mr. WOODS submitted the following: 
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That a copy of the joint
                                        resolution proposing to ratify the Amendment to the
                                        Constitution of the United States, recently submitted by
                                        Congress to the Legislatures of the several States for their
                                        concurrence, be enrolled on vellum, and forwarded by his
                                        Excellency the Governor to the President of the United
                                        States, with a request that the President cause it to be
                                        laid before Congress.
                                
                            
                        
                         The resolution was adopted.
                         And then--at 10:25 P. M.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the House adjourned till to-morrow morning at
                            nine o'clock. 

                    
                


                
                
                     IN SENATE.
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 14, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                     On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the reading of yesterday's journal was dispensed
                        with.
                    
                        AGRICULTURAL REPORTS.
                        Mr. HORD presented a resolution adopted at a meeting of the Union
                            Agricultural Society of Johnson, Shelby, Bartholomew and Brown counties,
                            urging the printing of the reports of the State Board of Agriculture for
                            the year 1861 and thereafter, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Agriculture.
                        Mr. OYLER presented a similar petition, which took the same course
                            without reading.
                    
                    
                        CITY IMPROVEMENTS.
                        Mr. WARD, from the Committee on Corporations, having
                            considered the resolution printed on page 165 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                            REPORTS, submitted two bills on that subject, to avoid any
                            constitutional objection, entitled as follows:
                        The Committee on Corporation's bill, [S. 163] touching
                            the laying out of cities and additions thereto, and the making and
                            recording of plats thereof, and legalizing plats of such cities and
                            additions thereto heretofore made and recorded.
                        The Committee on Corporations' bill [S. 164], touching
                            the disposition of lots, streets, alleys, public squares and grounds
                            within the corporate limits of any incorporated city heretofore vacated
                            or hereafter vacated.
                        Which bills were read the first time, and severally passed to the second
                            reading. 
                    
                    
                        AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES--CLERICAL ERROR.
                        Leave being granted. Mr. COBB offered the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, The amendment of the organic law
                                        of a great nation is a question of very grave importance to
                                        the people thereof, and should not be passed upon by their
                                        representatives without mature deliberation, and such
                                        amendment should be altogether correct in language; and
                                        every word should be used therein which is necessary to
                                        plainly set forth the meaning of the Legislature and,
                                    WHEREAS, Senate joint resolution, No. 16, ratifying the
                                        amendment proposed by Congress to the Constitution of the
                                        United States, was passed by this Senate in great haste, and
                                        was imperfect in its language and in its dates, in this,
                                        that the word "States" was left out after the word "United"
                                        and in this, that the figures "1863" were used instead of
                                        the figures "1865;" and in this imperfect state it was
                                        ordered to be reported to the House : Therefore,
                                    Resolved, That the House of Representatives
                                        be requested to return said joint resolution to the Senate
                                        at an early day, in order that the Senate may perfect the
                                        same. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT did not think this resolution stated facts. The original
                            joint resolution did have the errors in it but in the engrossed
                            resolution, they were corrected, and as the engrossment takes place
                            before the passage of the resolution of course our journals show it
                            passed correct. It may be a matter of fact, however, that the clerk did
                            not engross it till after it was passed, and whether he had a right to
                            make that correction is another question. He was prepared to defend the
                            action of the clerk in this matter, upon the ground that it is the
                            universal practice of clerks wherever they see that a small word is left
                            out to no wise changing the sense to insert it. But whether the clerk
                            did right or wrong can in no wise effect the legality of this joint
                            resolution, because it was engrossed correct. He regarded this as a mere
                            technical quibble, and that it had better be dropped where it was.

                        A message from the House of Representatives here announced the passage by
                            that body of the joint resolution S.
                                16.
                        Mr. COBB was satisfied beyond all question that no Clerk or Secretary has
                            any legal power to add one single word or take one single word from any
                            bill, joint resolution, or other matter passed by any deliberative body.
                            Such a thing had never been practiced, for when that is the case it
                            ceases to be the act or resolution of the body. So far as this joint
                            resolution [S. 16.] is concerned, there can be no question about the
                            facts, because when it was on the third reading its defects were made
                            known to the Senate. The Senator from Union (Mr. Bennett,) himself moved
                            to amend the resolution, and to that motion I objected, for the reason
                            that I had a right to under parliamentary law; and the resolution could
                            not be amended except, by unanimous consent. The resolution passed in
                            the very language the Senator from Union tried to correct; and it went
                            to the House with the words "approved February 3, 1863" entirely left
                            out. It was sent back here in that form, with a request that those words
                            be inserted, and the Secretary inserted, not the figures used by the
                            Senate in the passage of the resolution. not intending anything wrong,
                            for I would not so charge any one connected with the Senate had he put
                            in the words ''approved February 3, 1865," instead of the words
                            "approved February 3, 1863," as passed by the Senate
                        As far as the words "States" is concerned, it was left out in the
                            original, and was not put in when the Senate passed the resolution. It
                            was not in the resolution as a matter of fact; and as  far as the action of the Senate is
                            concerned, it having refused to so amend the joint resolution, it could
                            not be there. It was not there. It went te the engrossing clerk, and he
                            may have inserted it, but as to the other fact, the words "approved
                            February 3, 1863," were left out of the resolution as it went to the
                            House.
                        At the time my objection was made to the correction, the Senator from
                            Boone[Mr. CASON] suggested that it should go to the House, and be
                            amended there, and then it would comeback and we could concur ia the
                            amendment. I suppose Senators preferred and had taken that coarse, and I
                            was surprised in the House last night, when I suggested to two or three
                            Representatives that the Senate joint resolution, on which they were
                            acting, was imperfect, to hear Mr. Branham state to me that he believed
                            it had been perfected. I presume no Senator will pretend, that the
                            resolution was perfected by the Senate, and it could sot be perfected in
                            any other way.
                        And I will call the attention of the Senate to another fact. Senators who
                            acted with me, occupied but one hour and thirty-five minutes in the
                            discussion of this joint resolution. I make this statement for the
                            reason they may not have noticed it so clearly, for the reason that the
                            organ of the Republican party in this city announced that we had
                            discussed it for three days. It was discussed but, a small portion of
                            three days, and as far as Senators on my side of this question are
                            concerned they only spent one hour and thirty-five minutes in its
                            discussion.
                        Mr. OYLER said that the words "approved February 3, 1863," had nothing to
                            do with the resolution, is no part of it, and is not necessary to give
                            it the force and form of law, and in proof of this, called attention to
                            the action of Congress in point; and to the Constitution of the United
                            States itself. It is a rule of common sense that a clerical error does
                            not vitiate a law. And no man can read the resolution without supplying
                            the word "States." Our Clerk read it United States; and aithough in
                            point of fact upon paper it was not there, yet in the minds and hearts
                            of Senators', they received it, and so acted and so voted.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. After, the joint resolution had been ordered to
                            be considered as engrossed and read the third time now, the then reading
                            Secretary called my attention to the fact that the word "States" had
                            been left out, and that the figures "1863" were used instead of the
                            figures "1865," but; he said in the same connection that when he read
                            the joint resolution the first time, he read it as though the word
                            "States" was in it, and that he read the figure "3" as though it was the
                            figure "5,". There was then a suggestion made by the Senator from Union
                            that the joint resolution be amended; to which the Senator from Lawrence
                            objected; and the Senator from Boone suggested no amendment was
                            necessary; that the House could make the correction and return it. And
                            the Senate then went on and passed upon the joint resolution.
                        Mr. CORBIN. There can be but little doubt about the true state of facts
                            in regard to this resolution. The resolution was passed actually, and in
                            point of fact, with the word "States " out; and "1865," as now in the
                            resolution, was "1863" The question, then is, whether we will allow the
                            Secretary of the Senate to correct acts-that we pass? Why is it that we
                            have a Committee on Phraseology if the Secretary is to take that duty
                            off their hands, and perform that office? If the Secretaries, or any
                            other power, have the right to change one word, they have the right to
                            change two, and if a portion the whole section. Now, the principle will
                            hold good throughout. If recognize the principle that a clerk has right
                            to change the phraseology of bills, and insert words that are left out,
                            we make him the law-making power, instead of ourselves. I understand
                            from the Secretary that he has been exercising that privilege, or
                            custom, or whatever you call it, and that he will continue to do so
                            until otherwise ordered. It is high time that this Senate order him to
                            the contrary. If the Secretary is going to do this, and we an going to
                            let him understand he can do it, (and I am not now casting any censure
                            upon the Secretary,) it seems to me we might as well pass a resolution
                            authorising him to correct the laws passed here, in spirit and in
                            letter.
                        The resolution that was passed did not have the word "States" in it. It
                            was considered engrossed. It makes no difference what we understand
                            about it, the fact is it was not engrossed. After it was passed, it was
                            taken into the Secretary's enrolling room, and there engrossed, and the
                            word ''States" put in it The Secretary corrected it after the Senate
                            passed the bill: and after it had been sent to the House it was brought
                            back and another correction made. Now, although that may be a trivial
                            matter, so far as this resolution is concerned the principle that is
                            involved in it-it is an important one, and one that we should consider
                            now. 
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the special order for this hour-the Fee and
                            Salary Bill [S. 67]-was postponed till 4 o'clock.
                        Mr. WRIGHT understood the Clerk to read the joint resolution correctly
                            the first and second time, although it is true we passed it in the
                            Senators say. 
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved to lay the on the table.

                        Mr. Gifford announced that he had paired with Mr. Noyes on all political
                            questions.
                        So the resolution was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        The Committee on Finance returned the solider's relief
                            bill, [H. R. 14] recommending its
                            passage with amendments appropriating $100,000 annually, under the

                        CLERICAL ERROR.
                        
                        Leave being granted upon a divison--affirmative 22, negative 15-- Mr.
                            BENNETT offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate hereby approve
                                        the action of A. L. Whittlesy, Principal Secretary of the
                                        Senate, in reference to the engrossment of Senate joint
                                        resolution No. 16. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. HORD moved to amend by striking out all after the word resolved and
                            inserting the following:
                        
                            That the joint resolution reported from the house
                                purporting to be Senate Joint resolution No. 16, be returned to the
                                House, and that it be informed that the resolution as passed in the
                                House, and purporting to have originated in and passed the Senate,
                                did not originate in or pass the Senate as reported from the House,
                                and that it is not Senate joint resolution No. 16, inasmuch as it is
                                different from the Senate joint resolution in this, to-wit: It has
                                the word "States" after the word "United," and purports to have been
                                approved in the year "1863" instead of the year "1865." 
                        
                        On motion of Mr. DUNNING, this amendment was laid on the table by yeas
                            20, nays 19. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to amend by striking out all after the word
                            "resolved," and inserting the following:
                        That in the vote of the Senate upon the resolution offered this afternoon
                            by the Senator from Lawrence, no imputation was thereby intended to be
                            cast against the purity of the Principal Secretary in the charge of his
                            duties in that office.

                        Mr. HANNA made an ineffectual motion--yeas 18; nays 20, to lay the
                            resolution on the table. 
                        Mr. HANNA moved to refer the resolution to the Committee on

                                        concurring.) That a committee of two from the Senate and
                                        three from the House be appointed to arrange for
                                        commemorating by this General Assembly of the coming
                                        anniversary of Washington's birth-day. 
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        VISIT TO THE MILITARY CAMPS
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that he had received a communication
                            extending an invitation to Senators to visit the military prisons near
                            the city to-morrow morning, 9 1/2 o'clock, whereupon, 
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, of Wells, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Senate accept the
                                        invitation n His Excellency, Governor O. P. Morton, to visit
                                        the military prisons near this city on to-morrow morning at

                                        of this resolution to His Excellency immediately.
                                
                            
                        
                    

                    
                        FEES AND SALARIES.
                        
                        The Senate then proceeded to the consideration of the special order for
                            this afternoon-being the bill [S. 67,] to regulate the fess and salaries
                            of State and county officers, which was read the second time.
                        On motion by Mr. WRIGHT, the bill was amended by adding to the Auditor's
                            fees, in the proper place, these words: "for each redemption quietus, to
                            be paid by the party redeeming, thirty cents,"
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to further amend by striking out these words: "except
                            county orders and papers returned by the County Assessors,"
                        Mr. DOUGLAS offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, The county officers of the
                                        several counties of the State of Indiana have combined
                                        together in association for the purpose of procuring the
                                        passage of a bill for the increase of fees and salaries;
                                        and
                                    WHEREAS, The association thus formed have
                                        a fund of three or four thousand dollars in the hands of a
                                        committee, whose duty it is to distribute said fund; and
                                    WHEREAS, Said committee have not disbursed
                                        said fund, as designed by the association, and to this late
                                        date no member of the Legislature having received any
                                        benefit from said fund, directly or indirectly,
                                        therefore
                                    Be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the
                                            State of Indiana, That a committee of two from the
                                        Senate and three from the House, be appointed to make
                                        investigation as to said fund, and report at an early

                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the preamble and resolution to be out of
                            order.
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved to amend the motion by striking out the whole of the
                            7th section, referring to fees of Auditors.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the further, consideration of the bill

                            the BREVIER REPORTS) was referred to a select committee of three.
                    
                    
                        SESSION LAWS.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, it was
                        
                            
                                

                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns,

                        The Senate then adjourned.
                    
                


                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 14, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock, and directed the roll call, which
                        ascertained a quorum present and answering to their names. 
                    Mr. Spencer, Mr. Dunham, and Mr. Sullivan, of Scott, asked and obtained leave
                        to record their votes recorded in the negative on the Putnam contested
                        election case, and on the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment.
                    Mr. Stenger and Mr. Burton asked and obtained leave to record their votes
                        against the ratification cf-the Constitutional Amendment.  Mr. Collins had leave to record his vote in
                        the negative on the Putnam contested election case.
                    The SPEAKER then directed the reading of the journal of yesterday.
                    On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the reading of the journal was dispensed with, and
                        the same was authenticated without reading.
                    
                        PERSONAL EXPLANATION-CORRECTION.
                        Mr. SHUEY found in the report of his remarks on the Constitutional
                            Amendment two paragraphs in these reports of Friday's proceedings
                            attributed, which he read and repudiated. [The printers transposed the
                            matter, from the reports, perhaps, of the remarks of Dunham.] Then his
                            remarks, reported as in his seat, Saturday, were not simply, ''That is
                            not true," but, " Not true in point of fact."
                        Mr. HIGGINS rose to correct a mistake in these reports, and (there being
                            no objection)he said: In Saturday's proceedings, on the introduction of
                            the bill No. 165, he was reported as having said, with reference to the
                            act of 1852 to enforce the 13th Article of the State Constitution, "He
                            had heard of a very few instances in which laborers sought to enforce
                            it." He did not say that laborers had sought to enforce that act. He did
                            say that in neighborhood broils there had been attempts to cause this
                            act to be enforced.
                        It had been sought to be inforced by persons engaged in neighborhood and
                            political broils. Again, he was made to say at the same time: "The only
                            alteration of the law was as to the story of execution without replevin
                            bail. Besides this, the law remains as be fare." What he said was: That
                            the amendment proposed recounted the seventh section of the act of 1852,
                            and it was that to which the first section of his bill alludes. He did
                            not say that the law of 1852 remained the same as before, because there
                            was another provision in his bill by which he designed to repeat it.
                            What he said had reference to the seventh section--not the whole
                            law.

                        Mr. DUNHAM. If the gentleman from Marion would go on the committee, he
                            would withdraw his motion and serve with him.
                        Mr. Newcomb's motion was agreed to, and the petition was so referred,
                        Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, presented three memorials, asking remuneration
                            for property destroyed by agents of the Government engaged in the

                                Committee on the Judiciary.

                                Education, returned to the House the Report of the late
                            Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Mr. Rice's resolution with
                            reference to the unloaned school funds in the counties. As between the
                            two plans of loaning these funds, so that the greatest amount of benefit
                            may be derived from them:
                         By increasing the amount that may be loaned, and by investing the school
                            fun in State stocks, the committee are in favor of the former. The
                            committee express entire satisfaction with the manner in which the Hon.
                            S. L. Rugg has discharged his duties as Superintendent of Public
                            Instruction.
                        Mr. GREGORY, from the same committee, returned the petition of Jesse L.
                            Harper and  others, soldiers in the
                            service of the United States, asking that the proceeds of the lands
                            donated by the Congress of the United States for the endowment of an
                            Agricultural College, be applied to the erection of a Soldiers' Home,
                            recommending that no action be had on that subject. 
                        Mr. CHAMBERS submitted a report from the Committee on Engrossed
                                Bills.
                         Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, returned Mr. Woods' resolution for prohibiting
                            County Boards from investing school funds in county bonds, reporting
                            legislation inexpedient- -such investment being already prohibited by
                            law.
                    
                    
                        THIRTEENTH ARTICLE.
                        The SPEAKER announced the order of unfinished business- -Mr. Buskirk's
                            motion to reject Mr. Higgin's bill, [H. R. 165]
                        Mr. BUSKIRK had leave to withdraw his motion to reject, and moved to
                            strike out the enacting clause. 
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair was of the opinion that it is not competent for
                            the gentlemen to make such a motion at this stage of the bill.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK referred to rule 32. If the motion to strike out the
                            enacting clause is carried it will have the effect of rejection.
                        The SPEAKER. The motion would be in order on the second reading.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK then renewed his motion to reject the bill.
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved to lay the motion on the table.
                        The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                            resulted--yeas, 46 ; nays, 36, as follows:

                                        Stewart, Stivers, Stringer, Sullivan, of Posey and
                                        Vanderburgh, Trusler, Upson, Welch, Whiteside, Willis,
                                        Woodruff, Zeigler and Mr. Speaker-46.
                                    NAYS-Messrs. Bird, Boyd, Burton, Barbell, Buskirk, Coffroth,
                                        Collins, Colover, Croan, Crook, Dunham, Emerson, Glazebrook,
                                        Gregg, Groves, Hargrove, Harrison, Humphreys, Hunt,
                                        Lasselle, Lee, Lemon, Lopp, Miller, of Clinton, Perigo,
                                        Richardson, Roach, Shoaff, of Allen, Shoaff, of Jay,
                                        Spencer, Stenger, Stacker, Sullivan, of Scott, Thatcher,

                        So the motion to reject was laid on the table.
                        On motion by Mr. HIGGINS, his bill, No. 165, was referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                    
                    
                        ACCOUNTS OF ORDNANCE AND CLOTHING.
                        Mr. KILGORE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, The officers in the field find
                                        great difficulty in settling their accounts for
                                        quartermaster and ordnance stores, issued to them by the
                                        State of Indiana, end for which they are held accountable by
                                        the General Government, owing to their inability to procure
                                        correct statements on their accounts, have lost their papers
                                        while in the field; and,
                                    Whereas, The books of the Quartermaster General and Chief of
                                        Ordnance contain, all the information desired; and,
                                    Whereas, The said accounts from the commencement of the war
                                        up to the 31st day of December, 1862, have been printed;
                                    Resolved, That the Quartermaster General
                                        and Chief of Ordnance of the State of Indiana be, and they
                                        are hereby directed to cause full abstracts and returns of
                                        the same to be prepared, printed, and bound, so far as they
                                        have not been printed, eight thousand copies of said report.
                                        Three thousand copies to be bound in full law, and that the
                                        State Librarian be directed to forward the same without
                                        delay to the Indiana officers in the field, and further
                                        deliver one copy to each Indiana officer who may have been
                                        mustered out of the service, and may desire a copy for the
                                        proper settlement of their accounts with the Federal
                                        Government.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the proposition be referred to the
                                Committee on Printing. It would involve a heavy
                            expense.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK explained the necessity of the resolution. For the last year
                            and a half five clerks bad been employed in copying these statements
                            proposed to be printed.
                        Mr. DUNHAM also bore his testimony to the necessity of the adoption of
                            the resolution. He knew from experience the difficulty on the part of
                            officers in settling ordnance and clothing accounts.
                        Mr. HIGGINS said this expense should not be incurred if the public
                            service did not demand it. Perhaps the committee might report facts
                            which would better guide the action of the House.
                        Mr. BRANHAM was not hostile to the matter. He wanted to get this
                            information, and he wanted the Printing Committee to
                            report an estimate for the entire expenses of the two years for public
                            printing, for the information of the Committee on Ways and
                                Means. The last two years' cost of printing was over
                            $200,000 &c,
                        Mr. CHAMBERS understood that it was proposed to print a book of
                            instruction as to settlements of accounts in the ordnance and clothing
                            departments. That was unnecessary. These instructions were already
                            printed for the service. It seemed to him that it was simply a
                            proposition to benefit the printer.
                        Mr. Branham's motion was agreed to.
                    

                    
                         LUCY SHAFFER.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS. The Hon. Nelson G. Shaffer, a
                                        Representative from the county of Fulton, departed this life
                                        in this city during the present session; and
                                    Whereas, Subsequent to the death of said Shaffer, the
                                        citizens of the county of Fulton, of both political parties,
                                        in consideration of the great expense incurred by the said
                                        Shaffer, and his limited means, and out of respect to the
                                        memory of the deceased, and consideration for his family,
                                        passed a resolution requesting that no election should be
                                        ordered to take effect during the present session, and that
                                        the pay of the said Shaffer, as member of this House, should
                                        be paid his widow; therefore,
                                    Resolved, That the Speaker of this House
                                        be, and be is hereby directed to certify in favor of Lucy
                                        Shaffer, the widow of said deceased, for the full amount of
                                        pay, mileage and stationery that each member of this House
                                        is entitled to.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB could not see any necessity for inserting the stationery
                            amount.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. There was not a better man in the State than Mr. Shaffer,
                            and his family were left in limited circumstances.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved so strike out the stationery money.
                        Mr. LASSELLE. If it was right to offer anything, we ought to give the
                            whole.
                        Mr. BURWELL proposed to allow $50 of the stationery money.

                        
                        Mr. SPENCER made an ineffectual motion to lay Mr. Newcomb's amendment on
                            the table
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK said it was usual to donate the pay of deceased members in
                            this way and there were no more worthy beneficiaries than those in this
                            case.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said the Congressional rule was to allow 3 months pay
                            subsequent to death.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecaaoe, spoke for appropriating all if any.
                        Mr. BURWELL withdrew his motion.
                        Mr. Newcomb's amendment was rejected without a division.
                         Mr. STRINGER asked for the character of the information that there was
                            to be no election to fill the place of Mr. Shaffer.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It was in the proceedings of a public meeting.
                        The resolution was then adopted without a division.
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED AND REFERRED.
                        
                        Mr. SPENCER introduced a bill [H. R 166,] for an act to amend the 148th
                            section of the act providing for settlement of decedents' estates,
                            prescribing the rights, liabilities and duties of officers connected
                            with the management thereof, and the heirs thereto, and certain forms to
                            be used in such settlement, approved June 14, 1852.
                        Mr. TRUSLER introduced a bill [H. R. 167] far an act putting a limitation
                            far pay for service in obtaining substitutes and volunteers for the
                            military and naval service of the United States in this State, and for
                            taking the same without the limits of this State, and providing
                            penalties for the violation thereof, and the recovery of such penalties
                            and fixing the limitations of such actions, and imposing certain duties
                            on county Auditors, which was passed, to the second reading and referred
                            to the Committee on Military Affairs.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, introduced a bill [H. R. 168] for an act to amend
                            sections 11 and 12 of the Revised Statutes of 1852, being an act
                            prescribing the powers and duties of Coroners approved May 27, 1852,
                            which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, introduced a bill [H. R 169] to legalize the
                            official acts of John Gregory, a Notary Public, in aid for Warren
                            county, which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. STEWART introduced a bill [H. R. 170] for an act to amend section 22
                            of the act for the incorportion of towns, &c., approved March 2d,
                            1855, which was passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        Mr. WOODS proposed to amend by adding a the proper place the word
                            "petroleum," so as to provide proper storage for the same.
                    
                    
                        TEN MINUTES' ORDER.
                         Mr. BOYD submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                     Resolved, That hereafter, during the
                                        present session, no member shall be allowed to speak on any
                                        one subject for a longer time than ten minutes, without the
                                        unanimous consent of the House.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to substitute twenty minutes for "ten."
                        Mr. BOYD thought twenty minutes was a considerable space of time.
                        Mr. LOCKHART favored the resolution, from the fact that a certain
                            gentleman spoke twenty-two times in one day on the same subject.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH proposed fifteen minutes, by way of compromise.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB accepted.
                        Mr. LASSELLS. Other remedies of the evil complained of, as the previous
                            question, might be resorted to, which would be better than such a rule
                            as this. It would be doing injustice to the House and the business of
                            legislation. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. There were important measures yet to come up before the
                            House, as the Morgan raid, also the resolution to expel Mr. Lasselle.
                            For these and other reasons be hoped this rule would not be adopted.
                        Mr. GROVES hoped it would be adopted. If gentlemen could not speak as
                            much as they ought in ten minutes, it would be a good proposition to
                            make another rule to allow them to write out their speeches, and have
                            them read by title and printed.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH spoke to his amendment to the resolution. Many things were
                            voted on without a proper understanding. He would apply the gag to
                            nobody. Twenty minutes were short time enough, and he had offered
                            fifteen minutes as a matter of compromise. He preferred twenty
                            minutes.
                        Mr. BONNER hoped the original resolution would be adopted. Gentlemen
                            frequently spoke here with no other object but to consume the time of
                            the House.
                        Mr. KILGORE moved that the resolution be referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                        
                        Mr. HOOVER demanded the previous question, and there was a second; and
                            under its force Mr. Griffith's amendment was rejected--affirmative 37,
                            negative 38.
                        
                        The original resolution was adopted--affirmative 41, negative 40--The
                            Chair in the affirmative.
                    
                    
                        PUTNAM CONTESTED ELECTION.
                        Mr. KILGORE called for the consideration of the special order, viz: that
                            portion of the reports of the majority and minority of the
                                Committee on Elections, assigning the seat of Mr.
                            Colover to Ambrose E. Hamrick.
                         Mr. KILGORE moved the adoption of the majority resolution.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. For the purpose of examination, he asked that the
                            consideration of the matter be deferred till to-morrow. He referred to
                            the fact that an error of one vote, as he understood, might change the
                            result. A single day longer would make but little difference.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. The Education Committee would
                            be absent to-morrow.
                         Mr. KILGORE. Yesterday, time was asked for the same reason. With
                            reference to the alledged possibility of a clerical error of one vote
                            stated that if further evidence was to be heard, Mr. Hamrick could
                            procure five other voters of Cloverdale township who would testify that
                            they voted for Lane and Hamrick.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. If gentlemen would not be guided as to their
                            votes by the committee reports, it would be as well to dispense with
                            committees entirely, and refer 
                            every matter to the committee of the whole House. He moved to lay the
                            motion of Mr. Coffroth on the table, but withdrew for--
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. He explained the reason why the expected examination by Mr.
                            Dunham had failed. It was certainly a new rule that would require
                            members of the House to subordinate their judgment to the judgment of a
                            committee. There was no discourtesy towards the committee in the motion
                            to postpone. 
                        Mr. COLOVER bad no objection to the case being heard as soon as possible.
                            But the papers were not in the House. He was anxious for the result.
                            Sure despair was better than anxious doubt. He hoped the House would
                            postpone and make this the special order for 2 o'clock this afternoon. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. No good could come from so brief a postponement. There
                            would be no time for examination. He modified his motion so as to
                            postpone till 7 o'clock this evening.
                        Mr. BOYD was averse to the postponement of business in this way.
                        
                        Mr. Coffroth's motion was rejected--affirmative 29 negative 46.
                        On motion by Mr. KILGORE, the matter was then postponed till 3 o'clock,
                            P. M.
                    
                    
                        WABASH AND ERIS CANAL.
                        Mr. RHOADS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    WHEREAS, the present holders of the Wabash
                                        and Erie Canal are charged in many counties of the State
                                        with an intention of abandoning a portion of that canal
                                        extending from Covington, in Fountain county, and 
                                    WHEREAS, Such abandonment would work a
                                        serious injury to the people of the State residing in the
                                        counties through which the said portion runs, and is in
                                        violation of the contract whereby the said holders acquired
                                        possession and control thereof; therefore
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Canals be instructed to investigate the matter
                                        set out in the above recital, and report by bill or
                                        otherwise what legislation is necessary to require the
                                        holders of the said canal to fulfill the contract whereby
                                        they hold the same, and to regulate the rates of toll that
                                        it may not be oppressive upon those desiring to ship produce
                                        and merchadise, or to use the same as a means of
                                        transportation for any articles whatever.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. RHOADS. It was true, that for the last three years there had been a
                            disposition to abandon that canal from Covington south. He understood
                            that the Company were required to keep the canal in repair in its whole
                            extent. It was desirable that this matter should be investigated; that
                            the Company, should ba required to keep, the canal open, and that the
                            tolls should not, be oppressive. He desired that, the resolution be
                            referred to the Committee on Canals.
                        It was so referred.
                    
                    
                        COMMON PLEAS IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT.
                        Mr. FERRIS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    
                                        Resolved by the House of Representatives, (the
                                            Senate concurring ) that the Senate bill No. 55, changing the
                                        time--or of holding the Common Pleas in the Fifth District,
                                        and providing for two instead of three terms a year in ,
                                        each county, be returned to this House for further
                                        consideration.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted. 
                        On motion of Mr. GROVES, it was ordered that there be an afternoon
                            session this day, and then-
                        On motion by Mr. SPENCER, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to suspend the order of business and take up the bill
                            from the Senate, No. 3, ratifying
                            the action of County Boards issuing beads to furnish volunteers or
                            substitutes, and for the maintenance of soldiers' families.
                        The motion was agreed to : and the bill, as proposed to be amended,
                            amended by the Committee on the Judiciary-(the first
                            and second amendments having been agreed to)-was read by the Clerk,
                            together with the amendments, reported from the majority and minority of
                            the Select Committee thereon-heretofore printed in these reports.
                        Mr. WRIGHT desired to offer a substitute for the amendment, of the
                            majority.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair could not entertain the amendment The question was
                            on the amendment proposed by the minority of the committee.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, explained the object of the amendment reported by
                            the minority.
                        Mr. KILGORE moved to recommit the bill and amendment and print.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The object of the motion was hostile to the bill.
                        Mr. WRIGHT showed how the amendment would relieve some townships and
                            throw unequal burdens on others.
                        Mr. CHURCH showed that gentlemen of property opposed this bill. Where a
                            county has cleared its quota, except one township, the tax would be
                            unequal for that township to pay; the bonds should be paid by the county
                            for its benefit. He urged considerations for the immediate passage of
                            the bill. He hoped gentlemen would vote against everything tending to
                            delay. Let gentlemen show their hands. He was here not only to subserve
                            the interests of the State at large, but especially the interests of his
                            locality. He was elbowed on every hand to know if this bill was going to
                            be passed.
                        Mr. Wright's amendment was now read for information. It is to this
                            effect: That in no case shall the property of any soldier, (or any
                            soldiers' widow, or of any man that has sent a substitute) who has been
                            in the service of the United States as a volunteer or drafted man, be
                            sold to pay taxes to repay the bonds authorized by this bill.
                        Mr. CHURCH. That's unconstitutional.
                        Mr. WRIGHT could see nothing against it in the Constitution. We could
                            exempt property from execution. He should not vote for that bill to levy
                            a tax on the property of soldiers in the field. He would resign and go
                            home first. He defended his proposition which had been read. We should
                            levy no tax that can be avoided. When these greenbacks shall be called
                            in and burned, then would be seen the folly of this bond and credit
                            system. If gentlemen want to tax, let it be done at once in a direct
                            manner, and let the people feel it, and not by the indirection proposed
                            in this bill.
                        Mr. BECKETT stated that his county bonds were being sold at a discount.
                            In his county, and the whole First Congressional District their quotas
                            were full. And in Knox county also, the soldiers who have gone into the
                            field, were selling their bonds at
                            a discount. He was opposed to the prospective features of the bill.
                        Voices. It is not prospective.
                        Mr. BECKETT. Then I am in favor of the entire bill.
                        Mr. CHURCH could not see the justice of poor men, subject to the call,
                            should pay, while men of property over forty-five years remain exempt.
                            He wanted such men should put their hands into their "weasel," and shell
                            out. 
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK concurred, in the views of Mr. Church, and, replied at
                            length to the objections.
                        Mr. TRUSLER was decidely in favor of this bill. His County Commissioners
                            were, at first opposed to the issuance of bounty bonds, but, upon being
                            petitioned, they issued bonds. He would have these bonds legalized which
                            these Commissioners bad been compelled by the people to issue. Many of
                            these bonds had been issued directly to the soldiers. If they were not
                            legalized, the soldiers would be the sufferers--the men who to-day stand
                            in front for our protection. Not less than 80 counties in the State had
                            taken this course to encourage volunteers. People ought to be glad to
                            pay this tax for the relief of our poor men and boys, who have so far
                            borne the brunt of the war, and will have to bear it to the end. He
                            insisted that they should be compensated.
                        Mr. STRINGER demanded the special order of the day.
                        Mr. CHURCH moved to suspend the special order.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH amended the motion so that this Senate bill No, 3 shall come
                            up again as soon as the special order shall be disposed of.
                        Mr. CHURCH accepted the modification, and the subject was passed
                            over.

                        
                            THE PUTNAM CONTESTED ELECTION CASE.
                            The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to read the resolutions reported by
                                the majority and minority of the Committee on
                                    Elections. The question being on the adoption of the
                                resolutions of the minority considered an amendment to the majority
                                resolutions.
                            Mr. LASSELLE said with reference to the students' vote, that the
                                question of residence rested altogether on the intention. He gave
                                authorities. To prove a residence, there must be shown abandonment
                                of former residence and intention of remaining. There was dispute of
                                one vote, leaving out the alleged fraud at Cloverdale. He was
                                satisfied that rejection of the sitting member would be a great it
                                justice. He proceeded to show this from the testimony. The contestor
                                was claimed to have been elected by one vote. Two Georgians voted
                                the Union ticket and left the county the next day. He read the
                                affidavits of these two men.
                            [Here the ten minutes expired; but the point that he would yield the
                                floor, was overruled by the Speaker, (Mr. Higgins in the Chair,) on
                                the ground, that a change of the rules could not, be operative the
                                same day of its adoption.]
                            Mr. LASSELLE proceeded. He read further from the depositions of
                                witnesses that cast their votes at Cloverdale, to show that, like
                                the two Georgians, they do not testify positively that they voted
                                for the contestors. They "called far the Union ticket"-they "voted
                                the ticket with Morton at the head"-they "don'trecollect the names
                                of the candidates for Representative""-they couldn't read." If
                                either one of these were rejected, it would make a tie. He could
                                show a larger number of fraudulent votes cast for the contestors,
                                but it was unnecessary. He then submitted facts and considerations
                                drawn from the testimony, to break down the allegation of fraud in
                                the returns from Cloverdale township.
                            Mr. SHUEY replied to the argument that intention is essential to
                                residence, the authority but turning the fact against the sitting
                                member. He said the testimony of the Georgia men was taken ex parte, since the commencement of the session,
                                and he saw in their affidavits themselves, evidence, ear-marks of
                                perjury. He referred especially to the fact that Judge Claypool,
                                attorney far the sitting member, candidly admitted that these seven
                                voters voted for the contestors. As to Cloverdale township, it was
                                our duty to reject every vote of that township. Unquestionably a
                                fraud of at least one-third of the votes of that township was
                                perpetrated on the people. But for this fraud, Lane and Hamrick
                                would have been returned elected. The majority of the committee had
                                shown fraud to such an extent that it was manifest that the counting
                                of the vote of that township was a solemn farce, and ought to bo
                                thrown out.
                            Mr. DUNHAM did not care a straw for results here. So far as its
                                influence on this body is concerned, it amounted to nothing. He
                                would look to the law governing the case. He abhorred election
                                frauds, and was ready to support any legislation that would repress
                                these frauds. He read from the 15th section of the General Election
                                act., to the effect that no irregularity of any member of the board
                                of judges or canvassers shall set aside the vote, unless such
                                irregularity or malconduct shall be such as to declare the contestee
                                in the minority. He argued here against the rejection of Cloverdale.
                                He then considered the law of residence, which would exclude the
                                students voles, &c. 
                            Mr. GRIFFITH had not been in favor of throwing out Cloverdale. He
                                submitted statement of figures going to show that Mr. Hamrick was
                                elected without Cloverdale. If gentlemen would lay aside feeling, as
                                he had, and come to the subject without bias, he could not doubt but
                                we would come to the same conclusion as to the justice of the case,
                                however we might all regret to part company with Mr. Colover.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, presented facts not properly in evidence
                                going to show to the extent of the fraud in Cloverdale township has
                                not been fully discovered to the committee. The affidavits of two
                                persons in Cloverdale for Lane and Hamrick, who not been called on
                                by the contestors to testify to their votes. But we do not have to
                                reject Cloverdale to elect Mr. Hamrick. And there was strong
                                presumption that frauds in elections have been committed in
                                Cloverdale for two or three years past.
                            Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. DUNHAM interposed the consideration that these
                                students could not acquire a residence without the intention of
                                fixing their residence in Greencastle.
                            
                             Mr. MILLER and Mr. NEWCOMB replied with the consideration that
                                railroad laborers have been held to be voters.
                            When Mr. M. had concluded-
                            Mr. COFFROTH argued generally that the well known Democratic majority
                                in Putnam county, and that this contestor received the lowest vote
                                last fall, give a distinct presumption in favor of the sitting
                                member. He caused the Georgia man's affidavit to be read by the
                                Clerk, to show not only that it was clear of the suspicion of
                                perjury, but that there was a certain Mr. 'Hall dealing out
                                soldiers' clothes to illegal voters. He cited various facts going to
                                show that there was not fraud in Cloverdale to the extent which the
                                gentlemen claim. With reference to the students' votes, they had no
                                more a residence, in Greencastle than a man would have a residence
                                in Chicago or in Philadelphia, by attending medical lectures in
                                those places. With reference to Mr. Newcomb's statement of the
                                custom to admit railroad laborers to vote, he replied, that custom
                                could not be held against a statute,
                            Mr. SPENCER moved an order that when the House adjourn, it shall be
                                till to-morrow at 2 o'clock P. M.
                            Mr. S. then made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                            Mr. COLOVER was glad to see a disposition to decide this question at
                                once. But still there are many things in the resolution which he
                                would be glad to answer. The gentleman from Elkhart and Lagrange
                                [Mr. Shuey] had said that Judge Claypool's judgment ought to be
                                adhered to. It was the Judge's opinion that he [Mr. C.] was entitled
                                to his seat. It did not appear that any man alleged to have voted
                                for the contestors in Cloverdale, upon any other than the testimony
                                of their own witnesses. He only asked, in view of all the facts in
                                this very close contest, that the question be remanded bank to the
                                people of Putnam county.
                            [Mr. Beckett and Mr. Patterson now recorded their, votes in the
                                negative on the resolution for the ratification of the
                                constitutional amendments ]
                            Mr. MONTGOMERY made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                            Mr. HOOVER demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK (by unanimous consent) submitted the following for the
                                operation of the previous question:
                            
                                
                                    

                                        Resolved, That the seat now occupied by
                                            Samuel Colover be, and the same is hereby declared
                                            vacant, and that the Speaker cause the Governor to be
                                            notified thereof.
                                    
                                
                            
                            There was now a second for the previous question; and the first
                                branch of the main question, viz, on the adoption of the resolution
                                of the minority of the Committee on Elections, was decided in the
                                negative.
                            The question was then taken on Mr. Buskirk's resolution, offered by
                                way of substitute for the resolutions of the majority of the
                                Committee.

                                resulted--yeas 31, nays 51--as follows:

                            So the resolution was adopted.
                            Mr. KILGORE moved that Mr. Hamrick come forward, receive the oath of
                                a Representative, and take his seat.
                             But the order was not executed, because the Speaker was absent-Mr.

                        WEDNESDAY, February 15, 1865. 
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                     On motion of Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the reading of the Secretary's journal of

                            have directed me to report that in the opinion of the committee there is
                            no necessity for any change in the existing law upon this subject, and
                            would therefore recommend that the same do lie on the table.
                         The report was concurred in.

                                Senate bills 161 and 162, (introduced day before yesterday,) were

                            ORDERED ENGROSSED.
                            
                            Senate bills 104, 108, (see page 129,) 114, (page 134,) and 127,

                                time.
                            Mr. OYLER moved to strike out "thirty," and insert "twenty," as the
                                monthly pay of private soldiers.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. HANNA, his motion to strike out was laid on the
                                table by yeas 28, nays 18.
                            The joint resolution was ordered engrossed.
                        
                        
                            REBEL RAIDS.
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that the hour had arrived for the
                                consideration of the special order.
                            The Senate then resolved itself into Committee of the
                                    Whole-Mr. Richmond in the Chair-and proceeded to
                                consider the Morgan and other rebel raids bill [S. 15] the question
                                being on the amendment, striking out from the bill all that relates
                                to the appropriation of money from the treasury.
                            Mr. VAWTER in support of the proposition which he laid down that it
                                wes the moral duty of the State to reimburse her citizens who have
                                suffered losses in property by the Morgan raid, took as his text the
                                doctrine laid down by Governor Morton in his message to the
                                Legislature at the beginning of this session, wherein His Excellency
                                says: "The true theory of our government is that it shall protect
                                the people in their persons and property against invasion and loss
                                from the public enemy, or injury by domestic insurrection. Where
                                losses in property have been thus sustained, it is much easier for
                                the people of the State to bear them in their collective capacity,
                                than it is for the particular individuals upon whom they have
                                fallen.
                            Upon that theory and upon the implied assurance that they should be
                                repaid, the majority of His Excellency was swelled in Southern
                                Indiana. The Legion had been summoned away on the day before this
                                raid; the people of Jennings county were absent, protecting the
                                hearthstones of gentlemen from the Northern part of the State; and
                                is it not right, as a matter of justice, to repay them their
                                losses--many of them being very much embarrassed in consequence?
                                While absent on duty, as military defenders of the State, the
                                invader comes and destroys their property; and now they come up and
                                ask a generous people to reimburse them. Is it not right they should
                                do so? Was it any fault of the people of Southern Indiana, that
                                Morgan came in upon us? At the time of the Morgan raid, there was
                                not a single  county in
                                Southern Indiana, but that in addition a to having filled their
                                quota of men, had furnished from one to one and a half regiments in
                                the Legion for the protection of the border. And there never has
                                been a call for money, on Southern Indiana, but that they have done
                                their duty. They have not been behind in aid societies, in sanitary
                                commissions, and in everything that tends to alleviate and mitigate
                                the sufferings of soldiers. Men from the northern part of the State
                                could not get down to help us, before he was driven off; and now we
                                ask yon who were protected by our citizens, to assist us ia
                                reimbursing those men who suffered. It is not a question of right
                                and wrong, so far as payment for horses impressed by Union troops,
                                is concerned, but that ia a legal liability. At least one-half of
                                those claims are for horses and property taken by Union troops. And
                                by whom were they sent there? Were they sent there by the General
                                Government? No, sir; they were sent there by Gov. Morton, and it was
                                his duty to send them there. They impressed horses, and took
                                property by virtue of the authority of the Governor or of
                                Indiana.
                            But it may be said that General Wallace was in the United States
                                service. General Wallace was in fact a United States officer, but
                                was without a command, and while in our town received official
                                permission from the Secretary of War to act under Governor Morton.
                                He was not acting under the authority of the United States
                                Government at all; neither was he there as a United States officer.
                                It was under the authority of Governor Morton and under no other
                                authority did he come.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN asked whether these horses were not turned over to the
                                General Government by this same officer.
                            Mr. VAWTER The officer that impressed the horses was Colonel Sauler,
                                of Hendricks county, who was a Colonel in the Indiana Legion, and
                                held no position in the United States army. He acted under an
                                official order signed by General Love. It is likely that many of
                                these horses were turned over to the General Government, but if that
                                were the case it does not help our citizens nor release the legal
                                liability of the State. If our citizens released them to the State
                                authorities they must look to the State authorities for pay. As a
                                moral right the State should reimburse her citizens out of the
                                public treasury for damages sustained by them in consequence of the
                                Morgan raid. Your servants came among us and took our property, end
                                we ask you to pay us for it. I do trust that Senators are prepared
                                to give to Southern Indiana the justice that I believe the gallantry
                                and patriotism of her people demand. I hope the amendment of the
                                Senator from Kosciusko (Mr. Chapman) will not prevail.
                            Mr. CORBIN. Mr. PRESIDENT--It was not my intention to have spoken
                                upon this question at this time, and not until others had done so,
                                but as no one appears to be ready to speak, I will offer a few
                                suggestions concerning it, not so much to the bill itself as to the
                                pending amendment. I am not opposed to the principle of reimbursing
                                the citizen for damages due in the destruction of his property by an
                                enemy in arms against the government in which he lives. In the
                                theory which lays at the foundation of all government is, that the
                                citizen shall be protected, among other things, in the enjoyment of
                                his property. This is a duty which the government owes to her
                                citizens, and a right which the citizen can claim of his government
                                as a return for that allegiance which he undertakes to perform it
                                when he becomes a citizen thereof. In the question now before the
                                Senate, I will make no war upon this principle. The amendment
                                proposes simply an adjustment of the claims by the State, and
                                opposes the payment of the same out of the treasury; the bill,
                                without the amendment, pays a $300,000 cut of the treasury. It is
                                not a new question whether the people have suffered or not,but
                                should be considered upon the basis of whether we have the power to
                                redress their grievances. I read from the 10th and 11th sections of
                                the fifth article of the constitution of this State, that the
                                Legislature has no power to contract debts, except in certain cases
                                specified, (Reads from the Constitution )
                            The right to pay these damages is not one of the powers enumerated;
                                then I hold this legislature is without power to do the act, however
                                much they might feel disposed to do it. But it has been contended
                                that because I live in the northern part of the State, away from the
                                effects of the raid, that I, with others, are opposed to it. Might I
                                not say to these peculiar friends of the bill, that they are for it
                                only because they are living in the vicinity of the raid and
                                personally interested in it, aside from any considerations of
                                justice.
                            When a citizen of this State asks a favor at the hands of this
                                Legislature, it is no question of mine try ask what portion of the
                                State he lives, but have we a right to grant the relief demanded?
                                does the Constitution confer upon us the authority? If it does not,
                                then we should not assume to exercise it, however much the party may
                                be injured by our refusing to do it, or how great the necessity for
                                it. Ours is no mission of charity and benevolence, but a duty,
                                guided and restrained by the Constitution as our chart. I have been
                                taught the doctrine of strict construction of constitutions, and
                                will not admit of any necessity to justify a loose,
                                construction.
                            This is not a raid against the State of Indiana, but the General
                                Government. If it had not been engaged in war this raid would not
                                have been made. It was a raid against the power of the General
                                Government, and for the purpose of crippling that power. If there is
                                a war against the General Government, upon whom does the duty of
                                paying damages occasioned by that war devolve? Surely not upon the
                                State, for it is not her war, but upon the General Government who
                                calls upon the citizens of Indiana to protect her against her
                                common, enemy, and the citizen calls upon the General Government to
                                protect him in the enjoyment of his property. The proposition seems
                                too plain to argue further. If then the debt is one of the General
                                Government, upon what plea can we justify paying it out of the State
                                Treasury? Is it because the Government is unable to pay? ls it
                                because Indiana is more able to pay, or her resources greater? She
                                has no machine to grind out greenbacks like her protector; wherein
                                does possess such facilities for immediate  relief. It is contended that it is
                                justice we should pay this out of the State Treasury. I say it is
                                the greatest injustice to the citizens of Indiana to bear this
                                burden.
                            The Union for which the war is prolonged, is composed of many States,
                                some removed far from the theater of war and the damages consequent
                                thereon, while others occupy that unhappy position. The justice in
                                imposing burdens in a Government is measured by the equality of
                                these burdens. And must not all see the great inequality in making
                                Indiana bear this burden, while others, remote from the scene of
                                warfare have been growing rich off the war, without any of the
                                burdens. Upon the score of justice to the persons asking relief, my
                                belief is they can get it quicker from the Government than the
                                State. We have not got a tithe of the money in the treasury to meet
                                the appropriations which we shall make before the session closes, if
                                we go on the way we have commenced. Then how are we going to pay but
                                by taxing the people? The Government does not have to resort to this
                                tardy process to get money; all they have to do is to take a few
                                more turns on the machine. If the State but pays the debt, the
                                General Government will refund it. Same contend, but my judgment is
                                different, if the necessities of the people are once relieved, that
                                plea can no more be urged to Government; but one State must get upon
                                its knees in Congress, and ask twenty other selfish and soulless
                                States to reimburse it for what it had advanced for them? If you do
                                this, it will be the last Indiana will see of the money. These are
                                some of the motives which prompt my action in this matter, in
                                favoring the amendment. Does the Constitution give the powers
                                demanded? And if it does, is it expedient to establish this new
                                precedent at this time of universal taxation.
                            Lt Gov. BAKER. I agree with the Senator from Lawrence, that this
                                measure involves important principles--principles which are at the
                                foundation of all government. I also agree with him when he says
                                government owes protection to the citizen, and the citizen owes
                                obedience to the government. But when he goes further, and says that
                                protection comes first in order, and that the obedience due from the
                                citizen is the result of, and springs from the fact that he is
                                protected by the government, I must dissent. I know that Blackstone
                                and other writers on the British Constitution assert this doctrine,
                                and tell us that each individual, when he esters into society, makes
                                an implied contract with the government that he will be obedient to
                                the government in return for the protection it affords him. This
                                idea is of feudal origin, and is not the American, nor the true
                                idea, in my judgment. Under the feudal system, the vassal owed
                                fealty to his immediate lord in return for the protection afforded
                                him, and so on up to the lord paramount, to whom all owed
                                allegiance, in return for the protection afforded.
                            The true idea, in my opinion, is that allegiance and protection are
                                reciprocal duties, because the relationship existing between the
                                Government and the citizen, is of Divine origin. Man is created a
                                social being, and without being consulted or being permitted to
                                exercise any volition on the subject, finds himself in society and
                                subject to law; and because this is apart of the Divine economy, the
                                Government owes protection, and the citizen allegiance. As well say
                                that the child owes obedience to the parent because the parent
                                protects him, or that upon his birth he enters into an implied
                                contract, to render obedience in return for protection, as to say
                                the same of the citizen in relation to his Government.
                             The Senator from Lawrence asks me if government is of Divine origin,
                                and obedience to government a consequent duty, now I justify our
                                fathers in resisting the British Government? I reply, by saying just
                                as I would justify a child whose parent would endeavor to bring him
                                up in vice and crime, in throwing off the parental authority.
                                Obedience is the general rule in both cases; resistance or violence
                                the exception, and neither must be exercised except in a clear case
                                of outrage or oppression. The facts must be such as will justify the
                                resistance or revolution in the eyes of the wise and the good
                                everywhere. If there is any doubt in either case as to the coarse of
                                action to be taken, that doubt must be in favor of the parental or
                                governmental authority.
                            It is the duty of the citizen everywhere to be governed by
                                conscience. I hold that sovereignty in this nation resides in the
                                people, and they delegate part of that authority to the United
                                States, and another part to the several States. They are entitled to
                                protection from the General Government and from the State
                                Governments.
                            Haven't we got the power to organize as militia? to collect taxes?
                                and don't the Constitution say the Governor shall be
                                commander-in-chief of the army and navy of our State? It is a thing
                                not to the credit of Indiana that 4,000 rebels were permitted to
                                invade the State. It is like the invasion of the old State of
                                Pennsylvania when Chambersburg was burnt, she having more people in
                                her borders than the whole thirteen colonies had at the Declaration
                                of Independence. It is the duty of the State of Indiana to protect
                                Indiana against invasion when it is not in overwhelming force. The
                                force seat against our border was only such a farce as should be put
                                down by the requisite foresight and preparation. Not certainly to
                                exceed 6,000 men crossed our borders. The campaign was culminating
                                at Vicksburg and at Gettysburg, and the United States had as much as
                                it could attend to. I say the citizens of the State of Indiana have
                                the right to such protection of the State against this invasion.
                                They owed allegiance to Indiana as well as to the Federal
                                Government.
                            The only appeal that can be made to the Federal or State Government
                                for indemnity is to the moral sense of the Nation or to the State.
                                This people make this appeal and say they were unable to protect
                                themselves.--One regiment of cavalry would have protected that
                                border; nay, I believe a battalion of mounted men could have done
                                it. It was known that the State was liable to invasion at any day.
                                Our citizens stood on duty day after day, and night after night to
                                guard the border, in addition to our other duties as citizens; but
                                our position made it necessary for us to do this  much more, and we did it. But the raid
                                came, and because you have not a sufficient military law in the
                                State of Indiana it was successful to a certain extent, and the
                                raiders traversed your State, and went on into Ohio, where they were
                                ultimately caught. But gentlemen assume that if the Government can't
                                perfectly protect the citizen the Government is bound to pay the
                                damages. Where do you get that principle? I say the practice of the
                                General Government is to the contrary. I believe the only exception
                                was in the case of the Oregon war; we then did pay citizens for the
                                depredations of Indians, but the general practice is not to restore
                                to the citizen damages in consequence of a public enemy. It is the
                                duty of the State to protect my property against larceny and arson;
                                but if the torch is applied to my dwelling, and it is burned, does
                                the State reimburse me? It punishes the incendiary when he is
                                caught. That much the General Government did in this case. The only
                                appeal that can be made is to the moral sense of the State or
                                Government, and it is purely with the Government to say whether
                                reimbursement shall be made or not, although our citizens were not
                                protected as they should have been. Did the State of Indiana do all
                                that could be reasonably done to prevent this destruction of
                                property? If she did everything that ought to have been done I
                                should not say a word more than I would say if one of our towns were
                                burned down, and the people were starving. In that case I would say
                                appropriate money to aid them, as in cases of public calamities.
                            The gentleman from Marshall (Mr. Corbin) says there is a
                                constitutional objection here. We most not create a debt. We don't
                                propose to pledge the credit of the State for one dime, but we
                                propose to adjudicate the claims, and, if there is any money in the
                                treasury, pay them, and if there ain't, they don't get paid, that's
                                all.
                            But how do gentlemen come to the conclusion that it is the duty of
                                the Federal Government to pay these damages? We hear a great deal of
                                talk about State rights, but it seems there is no such thing as
                                State obligation. My theory is that we owe allegiance to two
                                Governments, and they are not inconsistent one with the other, and
                                these Governments both owe us protection. In this case the State of
                                Indiana didn't afford that protection she ought. It is much easier
                                for the State ot Indiana to keep a small force on that border than
                                for the United States to carry on the great war in which it was
                                engaged. The State of Indiana is direlect because we bad no proper
                                legislation to protect the border. The State don't require a large
                                force in order to protect this border. We had more than 200,000
                                inhabitants subject to military duty, and there was not one of them
                                in the service of the State to protect that border.
                            It was out of the question for the Government of the United States,
                                who was at the same time fighting the battles of Gettysburg,
                                Vicksburg and Helena, and at other points where the presence of
                                troops was imperatively demanded, to keep such a force on the Ohio
                                border as could repel any raid that might be thrown against it. A
                                good cavalry regiment would cost the State about $1,000,000 to keep
                                it in the field a year, and as a matter of dollars and cents it
                                would be cheaper so far for the State to do as it has, for the
                                damages already sustained don't exceed $300,000, than to keep a
                                battalion in the field for one year.
                            But my friend, the gentleman from Kosciusko, [Mr. Chapman,] says that
                                if this bill is passed, you throw open the doors of the Treasury
                                wide for the payment of an amount beyond all calculation by future
                                legislation. We can't pass any act preventing future legislation
                                from opening the doors of the Treasury.
                            Mr. MILLIGAN (interrupting) Didn't the people of Southern Indiana
                                petition the Governor two years ago to remove troops from the
                                border?
                            Mr. BAKER. No, sir. A few members of the Legislature did. It was not
                                the people. Not at all. Now, I ask the Senator from Koscinsko if we
                                don't do anything whether the doors of the Treasury will not be just
                                as wide open? When this bill was introduced there was nothing of the
                                kind in it, and I drew up this section and called the attention of
                                the Senator having the bill in charge to it. It is designed not only
                                to prevent the very thing he says will take place, but for another
                                purpose. From the best inquiries I have been able to make, I don't
                                think the just claims ought to exceed $300,000, I may be
                                mistaken.
                            Mr. VAWTER, (interposing.) . The damages on the line of the raid will
                                not exceed $250,000.
                            Mr. BAKER, Then there was inserted in the bill a section which I drew
                                up providing that not a dollar should be paid until all the claims
                                should be adjudicated, and if the sum exceeded $300,000, there was
                                to be a pro rata, deduction so as to reduce the
                                aggregate to $300,000. Another thing I had in my mind. We know that
                                men will get up fraudulent claims; that claims of the kind will be
                                presented and supported by fraudulent testimony. What I wanted was
                                to make every, man who had an honest claim to oppose every dishonest
                                one, and I think it will have that effect. Every single man who has
                                an undoubted honest claim will see that the bogus claims are
                                excluded.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN. Would that be a final settlement?
                            Mr. BAKER. Certainly it settles it unless some future legislation
                                pleases to do something more, and you can't tie the hands of future
                                legislation. If you act, or refuse to act, it don't tie their hands.
                                This is an appeal addressed to the moral sense of the State. She can
                                say she will pay one-half, and no more, or one-fourth, or
                                three-fourths, or the whole. The fact that we agree to pay one-half
                                creates no obligation to pay the other half. I think it is perfectly
                                clear that here is a moral claim, and the very kind of legislation
                                these gentlemen have been engaged in. What is the soldier's relief
                                bill? Why do you propose to tax three mills on the dollar for the
                                support of soldiers and soldiers' families. Aint it the duty of the
                                General Government to take care of the soldiers? Certainly it is,
                                and I undertake to say it does to the fullest extent of its ability;
                                but we come in and do something more. 
                            
                            The day may come when the Canada border will be invaded, and it may
                                become the duty of the people of the State to reimburse for doings
                                done there, and I ask gentlemen not to set a precedent that may be
                                quoted against them. We say that the protection that was in the
                                power of the State was not afforded. The State is not doing as much
                                to protect its own citizens as the General Government is doing,
                                considering the great war in which the General Government is
                                engaged. When you consider the number of arms-bearing population,
                                and the resources of the State, I say that more ought to have been
                                done to protect the border than was done. But it won't do to say
                                that this man or that man, that this party or that party is
                                responsible for it. I say it was the duty of the whole State, and
                                all parties in the State; and when the proper legislation is not
                                furnished, or the proper force is not furnished to protect the State
                                from invasion, the State ought to reimburse its citizens for damages
                                sustained in consequence.
                            But I don't think I can enlighten the Committee further on this
                                subject I believe my views are correct; and ought to prevail. I
                                believe this bill, ought to pass; but I look upon the motion of the
                                gentleman from Kosciusko as a motion to reject it. I don't want the
                                bill to pass as far as I am concerned, if you take out the
                                appropriation. The way to get the General Government to act upon
                                this claim is to show you believe it to be right and just, by not
                                only auditing, but paying it. But for us to say that we will appoint
                                a committee to transmit these claims to the authorities at
                                Washington, with the Senator from Jefferson, [Mr. Allison] I trust
                                the Legislature will do no such thing. I trust when we ask for bread
                                you will not give us a stone. I trust we will not imitate the
                                Legislature of Pennsylvania on this subject. When Chambersburg was
                                burned up, and they applied to that great commonwealth, what do you
                                think the Legislature of Pennsylvania, did? They gave $100,000 to
                                reimburse a loss of $5,000,000. If you don't intend to give this
                                people anything, say so, but don't strike out every thing of value
                                in the bill.
                            Mr. CARSON. Mr. President, I did not intend to say anything on the
                                question now under consideration, but it seems to me that the
                                position assumed by the Honorable the President of the Senate in his
                                remarks is so untenable that I cannot remain silent. I speak, sir,
                                with all due respect to the eminent ability of that gentleman. I
                                understand his position in relation to this question to be, "that
                                there is no legal obligation on the part of the State, or the United
                                States to reimburse those persons injured by the Morgan raid." I am
                                aware, sir, that upon the principles of international laws as laid
                                down by some of our most eminent elementary writers upon that
                                subject, that the sovereign is not held responsible for the damages
                                done to the citizen or subject by a public enemy, but the injury
                                which is done by the forces of the Sovereign in repelling invasion
                                should be compensated for. There is an obligation on the part of the
                                soveriegn to reimburse his subjects for injuries done by his forces
                                in repelling invasion, for instance, the impressing of the property
                                of the citizens, the taking possession of his lands, houses, horses,
                                provision or other property.
                            But, sir, I take it that we are not left to the elementary principles
                                of international law to deduce our duty upon this subject. Our
                                Government is in the nature of a compact. The Constitution of the
                                United States determines our relations to the Federal Government,
                                and our State Constitution, our relations to the Government. To
                                these instruments we look, and from them we deduce our reciprocal
                                rights and duties. The Federal Government has its powers clearly
                                defined-its relations to the State and the citizens thereof; hence,
                                both the State and its citizens being parties to this compact, they
                                are to look to that instrument for their rights under it. I hold,
                                sir, that there is a plain, positive, and express provision in the
                                Constitution of the United States, equivalent to a guarantee on its
                                part to protect us against this invasion. The 4th section of article
                                4 of the Constitution of the United States provides that, "The
                                United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
                                Republican form of Government, and shall protect each
                                    of them against invasion, and on application of the
                                Legislature, or the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be
                                convened) against domestic violence." Can there be more positive
                                language than this?
                            Sir, does this language impose no positive obligation on the part of
                                the Federal Government to protect us from invasion by any public
                                enemy? I hold, sir, that it is clear beyond controversy, that it is
                                the imperative duty of the Federal Government to protect us against
                                all such invasions as the one now under consideration; but His
                                Excellency (Mr. Baker) seems to argue that it was our duty as a
                                State, to have anticipated this invasion, and place forces on our
                                border sufficient to protect it, and repel any attempt of the public
                                enemy to invade it; and hence we are morally bound to indemnify the
                                sufferers by these raids. But, sir, I take it that it was the
                                imperative duty of the General Government to have had her forces
                                there to protect us against this invasion, She has so stipulated in
                                the bond. She has put it in the compact, aid must be presumed to
                                know the condition of our border and the forces of the public enemy,
                                as well and better than we do and to her we are to look for
                                protection. She has so stipulated. It is her duty to afford it to
                                us, and if she fails, we think that she is legally and morally bound
                                to reimburse us for the damages we have sustained by her neglect of
                                this imperative duty. I apprehend it would be difficult to relieve
                                her from this obligation. We look to her for this protection,
                                because we find it in the bond. It is her duty to afford it to us;
                                and if she fails in this, she alone is responsible to the injured
                                parties, if the citizens of Indiana have suffered by neglect in this
                                matter. I cannot conceive that she would be so unjust to her
                                citizens as to refuse to reimburse them in full for all the damages
                                they have sustained. She has recognized the claims of the citizens
                                of other States for similar injuries, and I am satisfied she will be
                                equally just to the citizens of Indiana, and carry out to the  the obligations on her part to
                                protect against this invasion.
                            Mr. President, I understood from the friends of this bill when it was
                                first introduced, that eventually the United States must pay the but
                                that the necessities of those injured by this raid, were such that
                                they required immediate payment, and should the State pay them, she
                                would hold a claim against the General Government for the amount
                                thus advanced.I do not feel willing to assume the responsibility of
                                such action. I do not think my constitution would sanction my acts
                                in the premises. I have no right to expect they would. I am not here
                                to represent my own views and interests, but to reflect the views
                                and represent the interests of my constituents. I am not authorized
                                to lend their money or credit to any arson and more particularly to
                                assume the obligations of the General Government, and run the risk
                                of being at some future day reimbursed. They would not justify the
                                act. I can not vote to assume a duty and obligation which, to say
                                the least, must be of very imperfect and doubtful force, when it
                                must be apparent to every mind that duty and obligation is an
                                imperative and legal obligation resting on the General
                                Government.
                            Mr. MILLIGAN. I think there are facts in this case which have not yet
                                been brought out in this discussion. I take it that we had a
                                sufficient force sent there two years ago, by the Governor, to
                                protect the border. The Governor was re quested to remove these
                                troops from the border, and he refused to do so until the people of
                                Southern Indiana, through their Senators and Representatives, have
                                petitioned him to remove them. This was just about two years ago and
                                about three months afterward this raid took place, if I remember
                                right. I am not positive about the time the raiders were roaming
                                through Indiana, but we had troops on the border during the winter
                                two years ago, and the Governor did not remove these troops till the
                                people, through their Representatives, requested him to do so.I
                                would further add that in my opinion this is not the place to
                                correct these wrongs. The friends of this bill claim that a great
                                deal of these losses sustained by the Morgan raid, was caused not so
                                much by Morgan, but by the troops of General Hobson in his chase
                                after Morgan. General Hobson was an officer of the United States,
                                and acting under the authority of the United States. It can not be
                                expected that the State of Indiana will open up a commission and pay
                                these claims. They must certainly go the General Government to have
                                their wrongs righted. 
                            Mr. VAWTER (interposing.) There were no troops, as I understand it,
                                in the counties of Harrison, Washington, Floyd, Jennings, Scott,
                                Jefferson, Ripley, Ohio, Switzerland, or Dearborn, where Morgan went
                                through.
                            Mr. MILLIGAN. I can't say what counties they were in, but I know
                                there were troops there. 
                            Lieutenant Governor BAKER (in his seat.) There were a couple of
                                companies at Rockport that mobbed a Democratic paper there, and the
                                governor was petitioned to recall them, and he did so.
                            Mr. ALLISON. There never has at any time been troops stationed in my
                                county Switzerland, or the county below me, ana no petition from
                                Clark, Jefferson, Switzerland, Ohio, or Dearborn counties ever asked
                                the Governor to withdraw troops from the border.
                            On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the committee rose, reported
                                progress, and obtained leave to sit again on Friday, at 9 o'clock A.
                                M.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                            Was obtained for Mr. Van Baskirk till Friday, on account of sickness
                                in his family.
                        
                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                            Mr. BENNETT gave notice that on to-morrow, or some future day, he
                                shall offer the following:
                            
                                
                                    

                                        Resolved, That the first standing rule
                                            of the Senate be amended as follows:
                                        After the word "precisely." in the first line thereof,
                                            add the words "at 9 o'clock in the forenoon, and." 
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            WASHINGTON'S BIRTH DAY.
                            The LIEUT. GOVERNOR announced the committee on the part of the Senate
                                authorized by the concurrent resolution adopted yesterday, viz :
                                Messrs. Brown, of Wells, Beeson and Bennett.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    

                



                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         WEDNESDAY, February 15,1865.
                    
                    The House met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The SPEAKER obtained leave to record his vote in the affirmative on the
                        Putnam contested election case.
                    On motion of Mr. BRANHAM the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with.
                    On motion of Mr. BIRD, Mr. Coffroth was added to the Special
                            Committee on his bill, No. 71.
                    
                        COUNTY BONDS.
                        The SPEAKER announced the special order for the hour, viz: the
                            consideration of the bill, [S. No.
                                3.]legalizing bonds issued by County Commissioners, cities and
                            towns, to furnish volunteers or substitutes, or for the maintenance of
                            families of soldiers, with the amendments proposed thereto--[see pages
                            170, 171 of these Reports,]--the pending question being on Mr. Kilgore's
                            motion to refer again to the Judiciary Committee and
                            print 300 copies.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK urged expedition in action on the bill, and voting down
                            hostile motions, such as that pending by the gentleman from
                            Delaware.
                        Mr. SHUEY said he condemned this mode of fighting a bill. All understood
                            the general provisions and merits of the bill. Down with strategy.
                        Mr. ZEIGLER was opposed to the principle of local bounties. But as the
                            case was, there would be difficulties if the local bonds were not
                            legalized. His opinion was that the bill should not allow the issuance
                            of other bonds after a certain date. We should guard against high
                            taxation. Money would not be always plenty. To meet the wishes of the
                            people of so many counties, he was willing to vote for the bill
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. This bill would not legalise one dollar of bonds issued
                            after its passage.
                        
                         [Here, on motion, Mr. Hamrick, one of the Representatives elect from
                            Putnam, came forward, received the oath, and took his seat in the place
                            of Mr. Colover.]
                        Mr. HARRISON wanted the vote on this bill. He replied to the objections
                            urged heretofore by Mr. Wright. Bonds had been issued in same counties,
                            a year ago, and some were still issuing them. Those in the
                            service-nearly all of them-have received liberal government bounties. Of
                            those county bonds issued a year ago-a large portion of them were for
                            the benefit of all. We could not pass this bill, legally, and make the
                            exceptions proposed by the gentlemen from Jefferson.
                        Mr. WRIGHT said he proposed only to exempt soldiers' property from being
                            sold for the tax levied under this bill.
                        Mr. HARRISON still insisted that such a provision would be nugatory. The
                            bill was generally demanded, and but an act of common justice.
                        The SPEAKER. The merits of the bill were not in order on a motion to
                            refer.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, if in order, would read a letter from an
                            officer in the army, bearing on this question.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair left it with gentlemen to determine for themselves
                            what they would offer.
                        Mr. GREGORY. These bonds were generally gotten up by those more
                            interested in dealing in the bonds than the welfare of the soldiers. He
                            read from the letter of Major Kilborn, a constituent of his, dated
                            "Headquarters 72d Regt. Ind. Vols , Gravelly Springs, Ala,, Feb.
                            3,1865":
                        
                            "We get the paper here only once in a great while.
                                We heard a few days since that the Indiana Legislature has passed-or
                                was likely to pass-an act legalizing taxation by counties for the
                                purpose of clearing them of draft. We were unwilling to believe that
                                our Legislature would legalize such a palpable injustice. I received
                                to-day your paper of January 24th, and find that the bill has passed
                                to the second reading. It excites universal indignation among
                                Indiana soldiers, and we still hope that Governor Morton, our
                                never-failing friend, will veto it should it pass the Legislature.
                                There are at least five hundred men in this regiment who are serving
                                in the ranks, who left a profitable business at home and came into
                                the army from a simple sense of duty. They have lost for every
                                year's services from two to seven thousand dollars by the neglect of
                                their business. Is it right now that these men should be taxed to
                                clear of the draft those who have been staying at home at their
                                ease, or to pay them large bounties for going into the service?
                        
                        
                            Every member who will vote for a bill so monstrous
                                should be politically damned eternally. Mr. Editor, has the man who
                                introduced this bill "ever been to war?" We say, let the draft come.
                                Indiana has given sufficient proof of the loyalty of her people by
                                the number of volunteers she has already sent into the field. Let
                                the draft be vigorously enforced; it will fall in few places where
                                it ought not to.
                        
                        
                            The soldiers of the 72d regiment are perfectly
                                willing to serve out their three years, and after enjoying the
                                society and comforts of home for a short space, will not object to
                                taking their places again under their old banner, if the country
                                needs their services. But they do most earnestly protest against
                                Saying peace sneaks and Copperheads for staying at home and sneering
                                at others for the sacrifices they have made and are making for their
                                country. In the language of your Fountain county correspondent, let
                                the Legislature give us some substantial proof of its care for us,
                                and not "'buncombe resolutions."
                        
                         It had been stated in this debate, that most of our men in the army were
                            not heavy tax payers. 
                        Mr. KILGORE. This bill was introduced by a man that has been three years
                            in the army.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery. This local bounty system had retarded
                            volunteering. His county bonds were not now worth more than fifty cents
                            on the dollar. If we even stop where we are, our tax burdens would be
                            intolerable. To pass this bill here would be like the act of the man
                            that cut off the limb of the tree that supported him.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The letter of Major Kilborn referred not to this bill, but
                            the House bill No. 14, by Mr.
                            Branham.
                        Mr. KILGORE. If this bill pass, would not the counties go on to issue
                            other bonds?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB could not tell what would be done, but the bill would not
                            authorize future issues. In many cases these bonds and orders had been
                            demanded by the people. Most of them had been sold at par, and the money
                            had gone into the soldiers' pockets. It was no argument for repudiation
                            to say that speculators had contrived to buy these bonds at a discount.
                            Soldiers were now holding these bonds awaiting the legislation that
                            would make them good. The question of the value of these bonds was not
                            pertinent here.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK conceded the right of officers and men in the field to
                            express their views here by petition or otherwise, but they were not
                            always well informed of home affairs. A bill had been passed to tax for
                            the relief of soldiers families now at home. This million and a half of
                            dollars was in lieu of the lack of local bounty on the part of those in
                            the field. We saw the men in Camp Carringten to-day. Most of these men
                            had received local bounties-rightfully given and rightfully received. It
                            was a measure compelled in many cases by too people, and the question
                            was simply, shall we repudiate what the people have done? There was an
                            action now pending in the county or Knox that might result in a decision
                            that these bonds were illegal. Then the bonds would go down, and
                            speculators would reap the benefits. He would refuse to represent a
                            county that would repudiate these bonds. He would repudiate a
                            repudiating consituency. His county had more than filled her quota on
                            their local bounty plan-$500-too high as bethought. But he wanted the
                            vote against postponement and printing, and then to offer an amendment
                            himself. 
                        Mr. RHOADS. The bill was based on te assumption that these bonds are
                            illegal. could not see the point of the argument, that could call it
                            repudiation, if these counties could not levy a tax to pay them. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB had no doubt that whatever care had been taken in the
                            issuance of these bonds, they were legal under the act of 1861. 
                        Mr. RHOADS. Therein then he saw also an objection. There was a zeal for
                            the soldier that was not according to knowledge. We might bankrupt the
                            State. He instanced the action of the Commissioners in Fountain county.
                            At first, they could see nothing in the act of 1861 to authorize a tax.
                            But then latterly they had issued a large amount of bonds to fill their
                                 quota. And in Montgomery and
                            other counties they were doing the same thing now evincing that they
                            expected this act to reach back and cover the calls of December and
                            July, 1864 All the bonds of Knox county had been sold by the soldiers at
                            50 cents, and the bonds of Fountain county had been bought by sharpers
                            at 20 cents.
                        He would not say by the passage of this bill that these counties should
                            go to the extent of such reckless extravagance. He would quietly pass it
                            by, and let the Commissioners-not the people-take the consequences of
                            their illegal gets. The voting and tax-paying people were opposed to
                            this legislation. Quiet individual contributions were the proper means
                            of raising funds for these local bounties. He argued the injustice of
                            the bill. A man could elect to pay or go. The individual, by himself,
                            was responsible to the Government. His observation was that generally
                            the men of wealth had come forward liberally with their
                            contributions.
                        Mr. PATTERSON said no bond of Knox county had been sold for less than
                            $400 The bonds were $600 bonds. The soldiers had them now, expecting
                            that they would be legalized. The people were largely in favor of this
                            measure. With Mr. Buskirk, he would repudiate a constituency that would
                            repudiate those bonds.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK indicated a motion for the previous question, desiring the
                            discussion on the merits of each proposition.
                        Mr. KILGORE said the bill was not well understood. Gentlemen had said to
                            him that they did not understand it, and did not want action now. This
                            was the main reason of his motion. Poorer counties were hurt by the
                            issuance of bonds giving $500 more bounty than they could give. He was
                            not yet prepared to say-if he had time to consider it-that he would not
                            vote for some such bill as this. But in the present form, without
                            understanding it, he could not vote for it; and the gentlemen would say
                            that others were with him when it should come to the vote.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said there was not more than one page of loose writing in the
                            material section of the bill.
                        Mr. KILGORE would not discuss the merits of the bill, but there were
                            enough with him that thought it would be manifestly unjust to legalize
                            these bonds indiscriminately. He showed that those very men that had
                            done nothing for the war, were buying up those bonds at a discount.
                            These bonds were hoarded in the coffers of banks and wealthy men, which
                            they had wrung from the soldiers; and they were now making outside
                            pressure for the passage of this bill. These bonds were not in the hands
                            of the soldiers. 
                        Mr. BUSKIRK interposing. Not more than 5 or 6 bonds had been sold by the
                            soldiers from Monroe county.
                        Mr. MEREDITH. These bonds were now being bought in Camp Carrington at 35
                            cents discount.
                        Mr. KILGORE said that was doubtless true; and this bill would not be
                            passed an hour before these sharpers would be after more.
                         [Ten minutes expired.] 
                        Mr. BURWELL. The people were consulted by an election held in his county
                            about two weeks ago, and they decided by a considerable majority, that
                            they would issue bonds for $500 bounties; and volunteering there was
                            going on well. The people had demanded this measure, and he was in favor
                            of passing the bill at once, that the soldiers and people might be
                            satisfied. It was due to them.
                        Mr. COX. The Commissioners of his counts, by force of public sentiment,
                            had issued these bonds. He held that when we paid these volunteers four
                            hundred or five hundred dollars, we did not give them half enough. The
                            letter read by the gentleman from Montgomery was not written by a
                            soldier from Wayne county. They took care of soldiers' families in his
                            county. As a people, they were willing to be taxed in that direction. He
                            judged them by their past liberality.
                        Mr. THACHER, as be was in favor of the bill and wanted to see it pass,
                            demanded the previous question.
                        
                        There was a second, and the main question was ordered, viz: Shall the
                            bill and amendments be recommitted, and 300 copies thereof ordered to be
                            printed? And the yeas and nays thereon resulted-yeas 32, nays 48. So the
                            bill was not recommitted.
                        The question then recurred on the adoption of the minority substitute for
                            the amendment, reported by the majority of the special committee,
                            providing that property and polls in townships which have not been
                            subject to draft at the present and last preceding calls, shall not be
                            exempt from any tax to carry out the provisions of this bill.
                        The majority of the Special Committee recommend the
                            adoption of the amendment reported from the Judiciary Committee. [See
                            page 171 of these Reports.]
                        Mr. COFFROTH said the amendment reported by the Judiciary
                                Committee was not unanimous. His own impression was that
                            the amendment was not constitutional. He submitted that it was a special
                            tax operating locally. For example, a bridge on a township road is for
                            the people of the county. It would not be competent to authorize the
                            county board to tax the township for that debt. This being the case,
                            county debts could not be made to operate locally and unequally in the
                            townships. Gentlemen state that brokers have bought up these. He knew
                            that the soldiers of his county had left their bonds at home, where they
                            could get 90 cents on them. Doubts existed as to the validity of these
                            bonds; and the effect of this doubt was placing soldiers in the power of
                            sharpers and swindlers. He considered that the act of 1861 provided for
                            these county bonds. He read it. The provisions of this law were
                            complete. It had been pronounced valid by one of the best judges in the
                            State. But speculators will receive the benefits of our delay. Let the
                            past go. Let us legalize the past, and let the future take care of
                            itself. (Ten minutes expired.)
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. If we adopt the minority amendment it is simply the negative
                            of the proposition submitted by the majority of the Judiciary
                                Committe. With the gentleman from Huntington he held that
                            the Judiciary 
                                Committee's amendment could not be enforced. A State tax
                            must operate equally over the whole State-a county tax equally over the
                            whole county.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB would be willing to leave the Constitutional question with
                            the judiciary. He read article 10, the provision requiring uniform
                            taxation, referring to the action of the Legislature for taxation for
                            general purposes. It does not refer to county taxation. Then the
                            provision prohibiting local laws. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Can a board of County Commissioners levy a tax except as
                            the authority is conferred by the Legislature ? We can't authorize what
                            we can't do ourselves.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. We have a law authorizing each county to levy for itself.
                            But the General Assembly may pass a law allowing townships in the same
                            county to be tased unequally. Don't we know that there have been levied
                            for schools special township taxes? He argued farther that this was a
                            township debt. Should we tax townships to pay what they never owed?
                        Mr. COFFROTH. This amendment proposes to levy this tax on townships which
                            have not filled their quota. Some have half filled. It was equally right
                            that these should be exempted in proportion to the men furnished. He
                            reiterated the proposition, that we could not confer a power which we
                            cannot exercise ourselves. The Constitutional restriction was made
                            precisely to prevent just such legislation as this amendment.
                        Mr. LEE came up here to act with the minority of the House. But now, when
                            the majority differ, he would give his views. In his county,
                            (Washington) the Commissoners gave $325 to each volunteer. Some of the
                            townships, at the time, had partly filled their quotas. But it was
                            considered just that all should be equally entitled to the bonds. We
                            could never pass anything that will operate with exact equality on all
                            parties. He was surprised to see the majority divided on this question.
                            If county bonds were at a discount, the majority were to blame, for this
                            bill should have been passed long ago. It was the duty of the
                            Legislature to legalize these bonds in the past, and put them out of the
                            clutches of sharpers. Rich men in his county were opposed to this bill.
                            But a rich man at home could afford to pay while the poor man was
                            obliged to go into the service. He was for giving the last dollar,
                            before we give the last man.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. The amendments were unnecessary. The more he read the
                            amendments the less intelligible they made the bill. He would have the
                            original bill put through. This matter should be equal. The resistance
                            was from men of property. His county had offered a bounty of $400, and
                            he had many letters of inquiry as to the matter. He had responded by
                            telegraph that the bill would pass to-day.
                        Mr. MILROY endorsed the sentiments of the gentleman from Lagrange. It was
                            demanded by the people. It was supported by Democrats, and he thought it
                            could as well be acted on now as any future time.
                        Mr. RHOADS made an ineffectual motion to postpone the special order till
                            Saturday morning at 9 o'clock. 
                        The amendment reported by the minority was then rejected, and the
                            question recurred on the adoption of the amendment reported by the
                            Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. HENRICKS proposed to amend the amendment, by adding the
                            following:
                        
                            And provided further, That such County
                                Commissioners as may have issued bonds to furnish volunteers or
                                substitutes, or maintenance of their families, shall be required to
                                levy in the year 1865, an amount of tax sufficient to pay at least
                                one-half the amount of the bonds so issued, and in the year 1866 the
                                other half-to be assessed and collected as other taxes.
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. If the gentleman will change it to one, two and three years
                            it will be more acceptable.
                        Mr. HENRICKS had no objection. The object was to prevent counties from
                            going deeply in debt. His county had been relieved from draft, or would
                            be, he supposed, by voluntary contributions, and so were not interested
                            in this bill. But they were interested with other counties, and were
                            willing to be taxed. Taxation would be lighter now than hereafter. He
                            could not vote for the bill without this.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that this was an amendment to the bill--not to the
                            committee's amendment.
                        Mr. HENRICKS then withdrew his amendment, proposing to offer it again to
                            the bill.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK called for a division cf the question--the first branch of
                            the question being en the adoption of the first provison.
                        The yeas and nays were now demanded and ordered.
                        Mr. LANE'S county, in all the townships but one, had cleared themselves
                            from the draft by volunteer contributions. If this amendment is not
                            made, these townships which have filled their quotas will be oppressed
                            unequally, as standing with the one that has not. This amendment would
                            suit his county. Without it he could not support the bill. He showed the
                            ir justice of the bill without it.
                        Mr. COLLINS. Such a case as this was in his county: One township was
                            exempt by this means. A man of that township raised a company, and its
                            members were credited all to that township, though they were raised in
                            other townships as well. He would not think such a township could be
                            exempt from this tax under this proviso.
                        The first proviso was now rejected by yeas 41, nays 43; and the question
                            recurred on the second, which provides that this act shall not be
                            construed to authorize the assumption of individual contributions, but
                            only to counties, townships, towns and cities acting throngs their
                            legally constituted authorities.
                        Mr. RHOADS now moved the indefinite postponement of the bill.
                        
                        The motion was rejected-yeas 18, nays 67.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, proposed to amend the amendment, by adding to
                            this effect: Provided that any person who has paid money for which bonds
                            or orders have been issued, shall be entitled to a credit for the amount
                            so paid, upon satisfactory proof of the payment so made.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK considered the second proviso reported by the committee to be
                            right, and upon that supposition the gentleman's amend-  [amend]ment was wrong. When a man has
                            given money for a worthy and patriotic purpose he should not be credited
                            for it on his taxes.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH moved to lay the amendment on the table, but withdrew the
                            motion for--
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. The object was when the townships have paid
                            the money to relieve them from the draft, upon proof of that, it is
                            deducted from the county tax. He answered objections to it. From the
                            number of recruits furnished these computations could be easily made.
                            This amendment will reach the property of those who have done nothing.
                            It obviates the constitutional objection. We allow receipts for service
                            to pay road tax. This was a precisely similar case, of crediting on
                            receipts for money actually paid by them for recruits.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved to lay Mr. Miller's amendment to the amendment on the
                            table.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to--yeas 46, nays 33.
                        Mr. WRIGHT proposed to add a provision to the effect, that no person who
                            may be or who has been a soldier, or marine, in the service of the
                            United States, or who maybe, or may have been a drafted man or a
                            substitute in the military service, shall be required to pay any tax
                            levied under the provisions of this bill.
                        Mr. WRIGHT had submitted this as his effort to exempt the property of
                            those who have served in the field, their widows and orphans, from sale
                            to pay these taxes. The total amount of the tax proposed to be
                            legalized, would not fill short of eleven millions of dollars. And would
                            gentlemen tax the property of soldiers to raise this money? The present
                            quota of the State were to receive tee benefit of this legislation-not
                            the men already in the field. Let gentlemen stand to the law, and
                            legalise nothing that is illegal. This war was brought on by illegal
                            acts. If the war should last three years longer and we should continue
                            to issue by these bonds and orders, twelve millions more, we would, by
                            this bill, throw upon the State a debt of twenty four million. He
                            believed the people would pay the bonds already issued. But if they were
                            not legalized, no more would be issued. He referred to the speculations
                            induced ia this regard. He advised not to levy one dollar of tax that
                            can be avoided. He was afraid that this bill, without his amendment,
                            would drive the soldiers from the State when they should come back.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE proposed to amend Mr. Wright's proposition by adding a
                            clause to the effect that such persons shall be credited en the tax
                            duplicate for money so paid to relieve men from the draft--or on account
                            of services rendered in the field.
                        Mr. WRIGHT accepted.
                        Mr. JOHNSON proposed an amendment, which was read for information, adding
                            an appropriation from the Treasury to such soldiers and mariners equal
                            in amount respectively to their individual tax levied or that may be
                            levied under the provisions of this act.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted an amendment, which was read for information,
                            declaring that the provisions of this act shall not exempt from taxation
                            the property of any commissioned officer in the volunteer service above
                            the rank of Lieutenant.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK insisted that all these amendments were unconstitutional. He
                            was not going to argue a question which had been so often decided by the
                            courts. What cannot he done directly, cannot be done indirectly. He
                            moved to lay the amendment to the amendment on the table.
                        
                        Mr. GOODMAN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-affirmative 30,
                            negative 50.
                        
                        The question was taken on Mr. Buskirk's motion to lay Mr. Wrighn's
                            amendment on the table, and it was decided in the negative by yeas 26,
                            nays 64.
                    

                    
                         AMENDMENT OF THE ELECTION LAWS.
                        The SPEAKER announced the following special committee on the petition
                            presented yesterday for the revision of the general election laws,
                            namely: Messrs. Dunham, Newcomb and Church.
                        Mr. Hamrick was added to the Committee on
                            Corporations.
                        Mr. Goodman was added to the Committee on the Southern
                                Prison.
                        And then--at 5:30 P. M.--
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the House adjourned till to-morrow morning 9
                            o'clock.
                    
                



                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         THURSDAY. February 16, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M. 
                    On motion of Mr. BONHAM, the reading of yesterday's minutes was dispensed
                        with.
                    
                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                        Was obtained for Mr. Davis, on account of sickness in his family.
                    
                    
                        THE SUPREME AUTHORITY.
                         The LIEUT. GOVERNOR presented a petition from citizens of Indiana, which
                            was referred to the Committee on Rights and Privileges, praying that an
                            amendment be made to the Constitution of this State, and that the
                            Legislature request our Rspresentatives and instruct our Senators in
                            Congress to use their influence to obtain an amendment to the
                            Constitution cf the United States, so as to make it read as follows:
                        
                            We, the people of the United States, (humbly
                                acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power
                                in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the Ruler among the
                                nations, and His revealed will as of supreme authority, in order to
                                constitute a Christian government,) and in order to form a more
                                perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,
                                provide for the common, defence, promote the general welfare, (and
                                secure the inalienable rights and blessings of life, liberty and the
                                pursuit of happiness to ourselves, our posterity and all the
                                inhabitants of the land,)do ordan and establish this constitution
                                for the United States.
                        
                        
                            And we further ask that such changes be introduced
                                into the body of the constitution, as may be necessary to give
                                effect to these amendments in the preamble.
                        
                    
                    
                        MOBS OR RIOTS.
                        Mr. HORD submitted the following:
                         Mr. PRESIDENT-The Judiciary
                                Committee, to which was recommitted Senate bill No 47,
                            [see page 54 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.] with instructions to
                            inquire into the expediency of so amending said bill, as to pro-  [pro]vide a remedy for past
                            injuries committed by mobs and riots, have given the matter a proper
                            consideration, and instructed me to return it as heretofore reported to
                            the Senate, with the several amendments thus made by this committee, and
                            when the same is so amended, recommend its passage. The committee does
                            not deem it expedient to amend the bill in such a way as to impose a
                            liability on cities and counties for past injuries, inasmuch as the bill
                            is purely a police regulation, intended to create a sentiment and
                            influence against riotous behavior, by making it the interest of every
                            citizen to prevent and suppress it. And as the committee do not believe
                            that the proposed amendment would subserve the purposes of the bill,
                            though regretting the past and sympathizing with thoae who may have
                            received injuries from the violence of riotous outbreaks, do not deem it
                            proper to provide for those injuries in this measure.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of Senate bills numbered 30
                            and 31 (see page 44 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPOKTS, ( 87, (page
                            101,) 108, (p. 129) 121, (p. 138.) 149, (p. 170,) 150, (p. 193,) 158 and
                            160, (p. 215,) and recommending that 43, (p. 53.) 98, (p. 118,) 123, (p.
                            138,) and 146, (p. 165,) and that Colonel Mank's communication, (p.
                            194,) be laid on the table. 
                    
                    
                        CONTESTED ELECTION.
                        Mr. DUNNING submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT:The
                                    Committee on Elections, to whom was referred the
                                papers and depositions in the contest of Kennedy Brown against James
                                H. Vawter, to a seat in the Senate of the State of Indiana, have had
                                the same under consideration. The committee have patiently and
                                carefully examined all the evidence in said case; they have also
                                examined the law bearing upon the points arising from the evidence
                                therein; have patiently listened to the argument of counsel in
                                behalf of the contestor and contestee, and after mature deliberation
                                the committee have instructed me to report that, in their opinion,
                                James H. Vawter, the sitting member, has been duly elected to the
                                office of Senator from the District composed of the counties of
                                Jennings and Jackson.
                        
                            Also, the committee are of opinion, that as
                                plausible grounds of contest existed, they recommend that the
                                contestor be allowed his per diem and mileage up to this date
                                inclusive.
                        
                        
                            The committee further recommend that the contestor
                                and contestee each be allowed $100 for attorney fees, and that the
                                costs of taking depositions, except for attendance of witnesses, be
                                allowed.
                        
                        [The report also embraced resolutions in accordance therewith.]
                        The report was concurred in, and so the resolutions were adapted.
                        Mr. COBB moved to reconsider the vote concurring in the report of the
                            committee, and to lay that motion on the table.
                        The latter motion was agreed to. 
                    
                    
                        FEES AND SALARIES.
                        The Senate then proceeded to the consideration of the special order for
                            this hour-being the bill [S. 67] regulating the fees and salaries of
                            State and County officers-the question being on a motion to strike out
                            section 7, baring reference to the fees of County Auditors.
                        Mr. RICHMOND was in favor of striking out every section which refers to
                            increasing the pay of county officers. He read from the law requiring
                            reports of fees received to be made to the State Auditor, and also from
                            statements of fees filed with that officer in pursuance of the law
                            referred to. Many county officers had not complied with this provision
                            of the law, and he supposed the reason was that their receipts were so
                            high they were ashamed to report them. He also read letters from county
                            officers, stating that selfish motives would prompt them to urge an
                            increase of fees, but for the public good they agreed that it was not
                            best that the fees were ample, even in the present financial state of
                            affairs. This was no time in the history of our State for an increase of
                            fees, He insisted that the amendment should be adopted, hoping that the
                            bill itself would be eventually voted down.
                        Mr. COBB was also in favor of striking out the seventh section; for
                            County Auditors were better paid for the services rendered than the
                            other county officers. At a time like this we ought to be careful not to
                            increase the fees of our officers beyond what is absolutely necessary.
                            In justice to the people of the State, this section ought certainly to
                            be stricken out. All county officers except sheriffs, receive enough
                            pay--though it may bs considered not enough in times like these by the
                            officers themselves; for everybody seems to have a more grasping
                            disposition than common. If consistent with duty he should vote for this
                            section, but he could not, and would be compelled to vote for striking
                            it out.
                        Mr. WRIGHT had no feeling about this matter, but if the gentleman from
                            Howard (Mr. Richmond) would withdraw his amendment to the amendment, he
                            would withdraw his also, and would move to indefinitely postpone the
                            bill with a view to making than the test vote.
                        Mr. CASON counselled Senators to reflect before they act hastily upon the
                            matter. The statement of fees read by the Senator from Howard were
                            certainly lower than he expected to hear. The making out cf a duplicate
                            tax list is in itself quite a job--every county auditor has to employ a
                            deputy at times, and in most of the counties they have a deputy during
                            the entire year. Taking into consideration the responsibilities and
                            expenses of that office, and the charities the incumbents thereof
                            dispense, the pay proposed is not too large. The clerks and other
                            officers count one figure as a word, while in the auditor's office three
                            figures are counted for one word. You should pay your county officers a
                            salary sufficient to command competent men. He proceeded to show that it
                            is bad economy to reduce the fees of any officer.
                        Mr. CORBIN favored the motion to strike out this section, and should
                            favor motions to strike out the balance of the sections, The parentage
                            of this bill is evident. It belongs to that class of blood-suckers that
                            have appeared here ever since the beginning of the session. The friends
                            of this measure appear to be laboring under the theory that the
                            resources of the people are inexhaustible. But while they do this, they
                            appear to ignore the fact that all appropriations are met by taxation,
                            and taxes are met by the farmer digging it out of the ground. It is also
                            contended that we at raise the
                            salaries, so that officers won't steal. I deny this proposition. If a
                            man is a thief be steals because he is a thief, and whenever a good
                            opportunity offers. We have penitentiaries erected for such men, and
                            that is the lire to elect them to; and I will say to the Senator from
                            Boone (Mr. Cason) that if he can't find honest men enough in his county
                            to fill the offices at the present fees and salaries, they had better
                            send them to the penitentiary, and we will emigrate some honest men from
                            the north to fill them. Two classes of individuals seek office-the one a
                            thorough business man of wealth and influence, who wants the office to
                            make money out of it, the other is the poor man, who seeks the office
                            upon the plea of necessity. It is not this class who are now seeking an
                            increase of fees. They are making more than they ever made before, and
                            with this are satisfied; but the cry goes up from that other class of
                            fat, good-looking men, who fare sumptuous every day, and dress in purple
                            and fine linen. This is no time to listen to their speculative demands;
                            this is no time to take money from the hands of the poor, and put it in
                            the hands of the rich.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS referred to the resolution he introduced some days ago,
                            concerning an association formed by county officers, which was possessed
                            of moneys for the furtherance of the objects of the bill under
                            discussion, viz: an increase cf fees. He would not have introduced that
                            resolution bad it not been that some members of that association not
                            more than a week ago inquired of him whether any member of this
                            Legislature had received any benefit from that fund. This led him to
                            make inquiries, and he learned that a committee of three had a fund made
                            up by levying taxes on officers of the different counties of the State,
                            which they were empowered to distribute. He had been in favor of
                            increasing the salary of county officers, and was yet in favor of it,
                            but took it as a high insult to the Legislature of the State of Indiana
                            that a fund should be raised in order that it might have its influence
                            upon men the people have sent here to represent them on this floor.
                            Those who furnished that association with money were probably innocent,
                            and if so they have been wronged. But why was this fund raised?
                        Mr. CASON was requested to say to the Senate that the fund raised by
                            Auditors was only $400. and it was simply for the purpose of employing
                            some person to draw up a bill, and was not employed for any other
                            purpose. The Sheriff's fund was only $115, and perhaps some $70 has been
                            expended for the purpose of drawing up a bill on their part-the balance
                            remaining in the hands of the Treasurer. 
                        Mr. COBB was authorized to say that the Clerks of the various counties
                            have not contributed one cent to this fund.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS. If that was the object of the fund it was all right. If the
                            people had been so far mistaken as to send men here not capable of
                            drawing up a bill of that character then they did well to employ men
                            with the capacity and ability to frame such a bill, and gentlemen
                            possessing such ability ought to be paid for their services. He would
                            regret to live in a State where it was a hard matter to get an honest
                            county officer. The question in naming a bill of this kind is: "What is
                            the right and proper fees to be paid for the service performed? not what
                            is the lowest salary we an get a man to take the office for. The bounty
                            Auditor is probably the one most illy paid. He should vote for the bill
                            as it is, although in his opinion the fees and salaries should be
                            increased more than the bill proposes.
                        Mr. RICHMOND demanded the previous question.
                        The demand was seconded by twenty-six Senators.
                        The question being: Shall the main question e now put ?
                        It was so ordered.
                        
                        The seventh section was then stricken from he bill by yeas 22, nays
                            20.
                        Mr. MILLIGAN moved to strike out the second section of the bill.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.
                        Mr. BENNETT hoped the Senate would not postpone the bill simply because
                            it was thought Auditors' fees should not be increased.
                        Mr. WRIGHT was favorable to raising these fees, but we have spent nearly
                            a day on the 7th section, and he was opposed to discussing this matter
                            so long, and then killing what we have done.
                        Mr. McCLURG insisted there was a crying necessity that the fees of
                            township officers should be raised. There was some good things in the
                            bill, and we should not reject them.
                        Mr. NILES said that he had prepared an amendment which he intended to
                            offer, if necessary, at the proper time, limiting the operation of the
                            bonds to two years. Was he certain that the present state of things
                            would continue, he should be prepared to vote for an increase of fees
                            and salaries; but he hoped and trusted that the war was approaching its
                            end, when a temporary paralyzes would fall on the industry of the
                            country. The vast energies which are now directed to the prosecution of
                            the war must then find new channels which will require time. During such
                            a transition period, prices will be greatly depressed-the currency will
                            be curtailed, and we shall slowly return to a specie basis, though he
                            did not doubt that we should, after the close of the war, experience a
                            gradual renewal of more than our former prosperity. He could not think
                            that the present was a proper time to make the change contemplated.
                        Mr. THOMPSON supposed there were some officers interested in the bill
                            whose salaries he would not be willing to increase, but the sheriff of
                            his county could hardly live from office fees after paving deputies, and
                            from other portions of the State come the same complaints. When Senators
                            and Representatives raise their own fees in the way of voting money to
                            themselves in the shape of stationery, they should carefully consider
                            before they refuse to raise the salary of officers we know are suffering
                            for it, and that, too, only the little sum of 20 per cent.
                        Mr. CARSON. Economy in public and private expenditure was practised by
                            our fathers, but now we are in an age when greenbacks  flood the country. There must be a stop of
                            this extravagance somewhere; now is the time to begin. The bill before
                            us legislates for the affairs of the State, but is it really necessary
                            for the public good? If so, upon what principle? Are the people
                            suffering from inefficient officers, or, are the officers not receiving
                            a living compensation? Where are the means to supply the public
                            expenditures, to come from? I must come from the productive industry of
                            the country, and that labor is entitled to fostering and protecting care
                            from us. There are not very many of these office holders, he
                            apprehended, but that were living better than they were before they
                            accepted the offices. This is not the time for us, as prudent
                            legislators, to be extravagant, but it is a time above all others when
                            we should be cautious. The people do not demand this measure, and we
                            should not place further burdens upon them. They have burdens enough on
                            them now, and they will have more.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, was unequivocally in favor of this bill, because the
                            present fees of officers are not, relatively, what they were before the
                            war broke out. If the fees, as they exist now were but a just
                            compensation before fie war, now that the prices of labor, food and
                            clothing have advanced, existing fees would bs manifestly unjust.
                        But it is said we should not legislate for the present condition of
                            things, which are but temporary. I do not say it confidently, but I
                            think history will bear me out in the assertion that trade and commerce
                            do not readily resume upon the termination of wars, their pre-existing
                            status. There is no probability, in my opinion, but that the present
                            condition of things will last at least two years longer. I am not so
                            sanguine as some other Senators to think that the "good old days" will
                            return ere two years more run by. If they should, however, in two years,
                            another legislature can restore the old order of fees.
                        I cannot but remark, sir, this hesitation exhibited in legislating for
                            the present condition of war, and when that legislation contemplates
                            only the enactment of a necessary law, while upon measures changing the
                            organic law of the State, for the war condition, no hesitation whatever
                            was exhibited. That sacred instrument, which should only be reverently
                            approached and touched only with careful hands, Senators seem disposed
                            to make a plaything of, such is the carelessness and facility with which
                            they would amend it.
                        But some say that they will increase the fees of certain officers, but
                            not of all. If the existing scale of fees was just, surely then, the
                            reasons existing in favor of raising one officer's fees exist for,
                            raising all. I, therefore, am in favor of this bill just as it came from
                            the hands of the committee, and in that shape I trust it may pass.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the motion to postpone was laid on the
                            table by yeas 36, nays 4.
                        The question then recurring on striking out the second section relating
                            to the fees of clerks,
                        Mr. BEESON. If these officers are paid as well for their labor as are
                            other officers of the county, then the question arises should we
                            in-crease it beyond that point? la his county these men are better paid
                            than those engaged in the productive interests. Such being the fact it
                            would seem to be the duty of every Senator when acting upon a
                            proposition of this kind, to let officers receive compensation only in
                            proportion to the labor performed and the services rendered to the
                            community. But there are cases in which officers are required to pay
                            money out of their own pockets, for instance the sheriff, who if the
                            fees of any officer in increased, should bo one to receive the
                            additional compensation. He would be serving the interest of his
                            constituency to vote to strike the proposition now before the Senate,
                            from the bill.
                        Mr. MILLIGAN had taken some pains to make inquiry respecting the pay of
                            clerks, and had found that the clerk of his county would not sell out
                            the office for $3,000 a year. That is a compensation sufficiently high.
                            There have been no persons petitioning to raise these salaries but the
                            present incumbents of the offices, and at this time, when the taxes of
                            the State must necessarily be increased, we ought to try and hold these
                            things as level &a we can.
                        
                        The second section was stricken out by yeas 26, nays 15.
                        On motion of Mr. CORBIN, all of the first section after the enacting
                            clause, and third and fourth sections, relating to clerks, were stricken
                            from the bill.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to strike out the fifth section, in relation to
                            Sheriff's fees.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER this motion to strike out was laid on the table
                            by yeas 36, nays 6.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to strike out of the section all except the $3 per
                            diem for attendance on court, and the fees for serving writs and
                            boarding prisoners.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 21, nays 20. 
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved to strike from the bill the sixth section, relating to
                            Recorders fees.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to upon a division affirmative 27, negative not
                            counted.
                        On motion of Mr. TERRY, the eighths section, relating to Treasurers'
                            fees, was stricken from the bill.
                        Mr. CASON moved to amend the bill by inserting the law of 1855 in
                            relation to Treasurers.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas
                            26, nays 16.
                    


                    
                        SESSION HOURS.
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn, it
                                        adjourn to meet to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                                
                            
                        
                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                        THURSDAY, February, 16, 1865.
                    
                    The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with 
                    

                    
                         PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        Mr. JAMES and Mr. HOGATE presented temperance memorials, which were
                            referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. WRIGHT, Mr. OSBORN, Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, Mr. BURNES, Mr. STEWART,
                            severally presented memorials for legislation to admit of the
                            construction of a railroad along the line of the White Water Valley
                            Canal, saving the hydraulic power, which were laid on the table.
                        Mr. LOPP presented a memorial as to the Government failure to afford
                            adequate protection for property in the time of the Morgan raid, which
                            was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. HARRISON presented the memorial of the Union Agricultural Society,
                            and Mr. McVEY presented the memorial of the Committee of the
                                State Agricultural Society for appropriation for the
                            publication of the transactions of said society for the years 1861,
                            1862, 1863 and 1864, and also for the publication of the annual reports
                            of said society hereafter, which were read and referred to the
                                Committee on Agriculture.
                        Mr. BANTA presented a memorial on the game subject, which took the same
                            reference.
                        Mr. CHURCH presented a memorial for legislation with reference to the
                            qualifications, and the conditions under which physicians may practice,
                            medicine and surgery, which was referred to the select committee
                            heretofore appointed on that subject.
                        Mr. FOULKE presented the memorial of a committee appointed by the
                            Richmond Horticultural Association, for legislation to protect small
                            birds, which was referred to the Committee on
                                Agriculture.
                        Mr. BOYD presented sundry claims, which (without reading) were referred
                            to the Committee on Claims.
                    

                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES-NORTHERN PRISON.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH, from the Committee on the Northern
                                Prison, submitted a detailed report on the management,
                            condition, and accounts of said prison.
                        The report commends the official conduct of Thomas Woods, Warden of said
                            prison, deprecating frequent changes of that officer, especially on
                            account of politic il character. It finds from the last report the
                            indebtedness of the Prison to be about $64,891 in scrip. This scrip has
                            been due-some two, some three years. The Committee recommend that it be
                            paid principal and interest, for which purpose they recommend an
                            appropriation of $73,000. The indebtedness for which scrip has not been
                            issued is about $13,000, which they recommend should be placed in the
                            General Appropriation bill. The Committee recommend an appropriation to
                            complete the Prison, and submit an estimate that the cost of completion
                            will be $157,842 58. In view of the fact of losses sustained by David J.
                            Silver, on account of the state's failure in contract, the Committee
                            recommend that he be allowed the sum of $1,500. They recommend that the
                            Warden be allowed $2 000 per annum, and that the Deputy Warden be
                            allowed $1,000 per annum. The Committee also introduced a bill on the
                            matter.
                        On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, the report was concurred in, and ordered to be
                            spread on the journal.
                        On motion of Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, Mr. Noble obtained leave of
                            absence, on account, of sickness in his family.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Did the Committee propose to pay other claimants than Mr.
                            Silver, for losses?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. It did not. Other parties' claims were on account of
                            merchandize. Mr. Silver had to borrow money on account of the failure of
                            the State to pay in a, contract.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Why could not Silver receive script?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. With Silver, it was a pecuniary loss; with the rest, it was
                            a matter of merchandize.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved that the report be laid on the table.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to-affirmative 41, negative 28.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on Military Affairs,
                            returned his bill [H. R. 167] putting a limit on pay and for service in
                            obtaining volunteers and substitutes for the military or naval service
                            of the United States in this State, and for taking the same without the
                            limits of this State, &c., and imposing duties on county
                            auditors-with a recommendation that the same do pass.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, returned the
                            claim of J. H. Ross, for coal furnished the Legislature of 1863, $470
                            40, recommending that the same be placed in the specific appropriation
                            bill.
                        It was referred to the Committee on Ways and
                            Means.
                        Mr. GROVES, from the same committee, reported the allowance of the claim
                            of C. A. Ferguson.
                        Mr. EMERSON, from the same committee, reported the allowance of the claim
                            of John H. Frazier.
                        Mr. VEACH, from the same committee, reported the allowance of the claim
                            of Munson & Johnson.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the same committee. reported the allowance of the
                            claim of S. S. Palmer.
                        Which reports were severally referred to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means.
                    

                    
                         S. P. MEADE.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the same Committee, reported adversely to the claims
                            of S. P. Meade, late Sheriff of Laporte county, for carrying a prisoner
                            to the Jeffersonville prison, whom the Warden refused to receive,
                            because he was referred by law to the Northern prison. The Committee
                            recommend that the claims be laid on the table, for the reason that the
                            Sheriff should have known the law.
                        Mr. HENRICKS explained that the Legislature should not pay for the
                            mistakes of public officers.
                        Mr. HIGGINS asked for the reading of the statements of the Jeffersonville
                            Prison Warden, and of A. Langley, Auditor of State, showing that the act
                            governing was not published till the 14th of June, and Meade started the
                            same day with the prisoner to Jeffersonville. He, therefore, moved that
                            Meade be allowed legal  fees for
                            carrying the prisoner to Jeffersonville, and that the report be referred
                            to the Judiciary Committee, with instructions to
                            report a bill to pay this claim.
                        Mr. WILLIS took the same view. It would be an act of gross injustice not
                            to make this allowance.
                        Mr. HAMRICK had not examined the matter. A committee had reported
                            adversely to the allowance, and he was loth to vote against the report
                            of the committee. He should have to vote to sustain the committee.
                        Mr. SHUEY. There was no difference of opinion as to the facts. He recited
                            them. He had as much confidence as any gentleman in the
                                Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. HIGGINS recounted the facts, and urged the adoption of his
                            motion.
                        Mr. BECKETT was opposed generally to emergency clauses, and when the
                            emergency cuts off compensation for an officer in this way, he should
                            vote for paying him. The law gives a Sheriff but a meager compensation
                            at best.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, Should we exonerate an officer on account of his ignorance
                            of the law, while we do not excuse a criminal for ignorance? There was a
                            principle here. This law went into effect in the usual way.
                        The allowance was then ordered.
                    
                    
                        E. P. RAWLINGS.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Claims, reported
                            adversely to the claim of E. P. Rawlings, for losses sustained by him on
                            account of the incendiary firing of the Jeffersonville prison,
                            reporting, that, while they are satisfied that Rawlings sustained a loss
                            by the fire to the full amount claimed, they see no reason why the State
                            should pay it. They therefore recommend that said claim be not
                            allowed.
                        Mr. H. stated and explained the facts in the case, and the reasons for
                            the report. The claimant was not justified in storing the saddle-trees
                            in the prison. The State was not an insurance company.
                        Mr. COFFROTH had an impression that Mr. Patterson was remunerated for
                            losses in the same fire.
                        Mr. BOYD. Mr. Patterson had not received compensation.
                        Mr. COFFROTH had the impression that Patterson did receive something
                            indirectly. He moved that this claim be referred to a special committee
                            of three.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. COFFROTH then moved that the report be laid on the table.
                        
                        The motion was agreed to-affirmative 60, negative not counted.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, reported that
                            the claims of the Oriental House, of Turner & Dixon, of Munson &
                            Johnson, of J. Ramsey and of Eli & Bruler, be allowed.--They were
                            referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. 
                    
                    
                        THE BRIGHT LANDS.
                        Mr. BURNES, from the Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges, returned Mr. Johnson's bill, No. 73, for the
                            sale of certain State lands in Jasper and Newton counties, with an
                            amendment striking out and providing that said lands shall be offered
                            for sale by public auction, at the door of the Court House in the county
                            where the lands are situated, not later than 8 months after the passage
                            of this act-guaranteeing and regulating the right of pre-emptors,
                            &c. 
                        The report lies on the table.
                    
                    
                        WHITE WATER VALLEY RAILROAD.
                        Mr. COFFROTH, from a majority of the the Committee on
                                Railroads, returned Mr. Newcomb's Canal Railroad bill, No.
                            59, [see page 83,] adding to section 2 a provision, that nothing in this
                            act shall be taken or construed so as to render the State; liable for
                            any of the obligations of said canal company, and securing the hydraulic
                            power and adding a new section to the effect, that if said canal company
                            neglect, &c., a new company may be organized, &c.
                        Mr. LOCKHART, from the minority of said committe, reported, by way of
                            amendment to the majority report, a provision for the sale of the right
                            of way of said canal at public auction to the highest bidder, of which
                            due notice shall be given--the proceeds to be applied to the liquidation
                            of all debts owing by said canal company.
                        Mr. LOCKHART moved that the reports be laid on the table, and the bill
                            and amendments printed.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved to lay the motion to print on the table, but, withdrew
                            it for debate.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, would prefer to have the printing. A legal
                            question wes involved. He did not yet thoroughly understand the bill
                            himself.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH believed that the opposition to this bill were not so much
                            in the interests ot the people along the line of the Whitewater canal,
                            as in the interests of other railroads.
                        Mr. LOCKHART said he thought that justice demanded that the bill be
                            printed. So far as the majority had reported the minority agreed with
                            them, but they did not go far enough. There were other interests. The
                            Wabash canal was not well guarded. He was satisfied that this Whitewater
                            canal was valuable.
                        Mr. COFFROTH stated the action in the Committee. The bill seemed to be
                            well understood. The House understood the merits of the bill. Providing
                            that a canal company easy sell out to a railroad, excepting the Wabash
                            and Erie Canal. And saving the hydraulic power.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The importance of the measure was indicated by the large
                            number memorials received with reference to it. He was not prepared for
                            action on the bill could be printed before it would be reached in its
                            order on the calendar. He was rather of opinion that the bill ought to
                            pass. 
                        Mr. WRIGHT hoped the motion to print would not prevail. This was a new
                            thing in the history of our legislation. He recited the action in
                            committee. Only last night, a recommendation for the passage of this
                            bill was signed by every member of the Committee on
                                Railroads.
                        Proper courtesy had not been extended to members of the Committee. There
                            might be canal creditors, but with them we have nothing to do. It was
                            simply a question whether the 
                            people along this canal shall have a railroad. The bill simply proposes
                            that the holders of the canal, or any others, may sell. A railroad would
                            be a good investment. These motions were hostile. Men owning $30,000 in
                            that canal were here, asking for the passage of this bill. He recounted
                            considerations which induced the Lawrenceburg road to take hold of this
                            Whitewater road. Put the canal up for sale, and let the Junction road
                            buy it, and that company would never build the road there.
                        Mr. SIM was in favor of the road. The gentlemen's argument was conclusive
                            in favor of printing.
                         Mr. LOCKHART made a statement to show his position. The statement of the
                            Cincinnati road before the committee seemed to be very fair. He asked
                            the privilege last night to amend the report.
                         Mr. COFFROTH. The conduct of the Chairman had been fair and honorable in
                            this regard. He now insisted on the motion to lay on the table.
                         The motion was reject: and then-- 
                        The printing of three hundred copies of the bill and amendments were
                            ordered.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, from the Committee on Corporations,
                            returned Mr. Meredith's Railroad bill, No 144, [See p. 169] with two
                            amendments-adding to section 3 a proviso to the effect, that when such
                            company shall be formed organized, they shall, in suing and being sued,
                            and in operating such railroad, be subject to the Canal laws of the
                            State. 2. Appropriately inserting these words: "On the line of such
                            road." And when so amended, the committee recommend that the bill do
                            pass.
                        On motion of Mr. GRIFFITH (by unanimous consent) the Northern
                                Prison Committee's bill [H. R. 171] for an act making an
                            appropriation to pay the indebtedness of the Northern Prison, incurred
                            prior to March 11, 1861--[$74,000]:
                         Was passed to the second reading. 
                        Mr. TRUSLER (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 172] for an
                            act to fix the times of holding the Circuit Court in the Fourth Judicial
                            Circuit, composed of the counties of Decatur, Shelby, Rush, Fayette,
                            Franklin, Union and Dearborn:
                        Which was passed to the second reading, and referred to a select
                            committee composed of the six members representing the territory of said
                            Circuit.
                    

                    
                        COUNTY BONDS.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House resumed the consideration of the bill
                            from the Senate, No. 3,
                            legalizing county bonds, &c., with amendments proposed thereto: the
                            pending question being on the adoption of Mr. Wright's amendment, as
                            modified by Mr. Whiteside-described yesterday. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the bill and pending amendments be referred to a
                            select committee of five.
                        Mr. SPENCER, from considerations taken, stated that he would not vote for
                            the bill. Everybody with perception above an oyster, knew that it was
                            unconstitutional.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK had no objection to reference. There had been no politics in
                            the bill. It had been understood that we would support it till the last
                            amendment of the gentleman from Jefferson made it impossible. It now
                            leaves us in the attitude of voting against the soldiers' interests,
                            whilst they prefer violations of the constitution. All the authorities
                            show that the amendments are in flagrant violation of the constitution.
                            He would have gentlemen fairly on the record in this matter.
                        Mr. BURWELL moved that the amendments be referred to a select committee,
                            with instructions to inquire into its constitutionality, and if
                            constitutional, to report the bill accordingly.
                        The SPEAKER ruled the motion out of order.
                        Mr. BRANHAM had been uniformly opposed to this bill, and no agreement had
                            been entered into by him with the gentleman from Monroe.
                        Mr. WRIGHT knew that his amendment was constitutional-just as other
                            provisions of law for the exemption of $300, or the property of firemen
                            from paying road tax. He hoped the bill would not be recommitted.
                        Mr. COFFROTH suggested that the bill might as well be disposed of now. If
                            not, the same amendments would come up again.
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The object was that a committee might present an acceptable
                            bill.-He demanded the previous question, and under its force the bill
                            and amendments were committed to a select committee of five--affirmative
                            44, negative 31.
                        Subsequently the SPEAKER appointed the following special committee on
                            Senate bill No. 3:
                        Messrs. Newcomb, Buskirk, Wright, Church and Henricks.
                    
                    
                        REVENUE FOR 1865 AND 1866.
                        

                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM the House resolved into Committee of
                                the Whole on the special order--(Mr. Higgins in the
                            chair)--and the committee took tip the consideration of Mr. Branham's
                            bill [H. R. 160] to raise revenue
                            for State purposes for the years 1865 and 1866.
                        The CHAIRMAN directed the reading of the bill, which was had.
                        Mr. BRANHAM considered that the levy made would be enough. It was the
                            result of the best judgment of the Committee on Ways and
                                Means. It was five cents more on the valuation, and
                            twenty-five cents more on polls than the last levy.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK asked for a statement of the basis of the estimates for the
                            levy.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. We did not yet know the amount of the demands that would be
                            made on the treasury, the committee are satisfied that this was as far
                            as we ought to go. We have made the usual deductions for
                            delinquencies.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. What amount would the levy raise?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. About $1,300,000.
                        On motion of Mr. HENRICKS, the committee then rose, and
                        The CHAIRMAN reported the bill to the House, and recommended that the
                            same do pass.
                        The report was laid on the table.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM the bill was ordered to the second reading, and
                            read the second time.
                        
                        On motion, by Mr. BRANHAM, it was declared to be expedient to suspend the
                            constitutional restriction--yeas 82, nays 0--and then the bill was
                            considered as engrossed, ordered to the third reading, read the third
                            time, and passed the House of Representatives--yeas 81, nays 0.
                    
                    
                        APPRAISEMENT OF RAILROADS FOR TAXATION.
                        
                        On motion, by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, the House now again resolved
                            into Committee of the Whole-Mr. Griffith in the
                            chair-and took up the bill introduced by Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe, [H.
                            R. 158,] to provide for the appraisement and valuation of the property
                            of railroad companies in this State prescribing the duties of officers
                            in relation thereto, and repealing all laws in contravention
                            thereof.
                        The CHAIRMAN directed the bill to be read and considered by sections.
                        The bill having been read through, together with the recommendation of
                            the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        On motion, by Mr. HENRICKS, the committee then rose, and
                        The CHAIRMAN reported the bill back, without amendment, recommending its
                            passage.
                        The bill was then ordered to the second reading and read the second
                            time.
                        Mr. COLLINS. Railroads were, as he understood the reading, taxed for
                            State purposes. Were their property exempt from taxation for other
                            purposes ?
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Railroad property was taxed precisely as indvidual property.
                            He explained the difficulties of fixing a just scale of valuation on
                            railroads. The bill would correct abuses and evasions of the existing
                            railroad assessment law. This bill provides for one thing not heretofore
                            provided for. Its principle was that railroad companies should pay the
                            same State and local tax as other propertt holders--requiring valuation
                            for each county and each township along the line. He was sure, after a
                            full investigation, that the bill was just toward railroads and the
                            State.
                        Mr. COLLINS. It equalizes valuations, and that is governed by the gross
                            earnings.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Yes. In reply to the matter put by Mr. Coffroth and Mr.
                            Sullivan, of Scott, he explained in further detail.
                        
                        Finally, on his motion, the bill was considered as engrossed, (the
                            constitutional restriction having been suspended-yeas 75, nays 0)
                            ordered to the third reading, read the third time and passed the House
                            of Representatives--yeas 69, nays 6.
                        Pending the question on the adoption of the title of the bill-
                        Mr. SPENCER. Unless you incorporate is the title the change in the
                            misdemeanor act, the bill will be unconstitutional.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, considered that to put in the reference to the
                            misdemeanor act would be an infringement of the Constitution and fatal
                            to the bill.
                        The consideration of the title was passed over by unanimous consent.
                    

                    
                         SESSIONS OF THE HOUSE.

                        Mr. HENRICKS submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the sessions of this House
                                        shall hereafter commence at 9 o'clock A. M., and at 2
                                        o'clock P. M., until further ordered.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        The resolution was adopted-affirmative 47, negative 24.
                    

                    
                         PER DIEM, MILEAGE, &C.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH, (by unanimous consent,) from the select committee on the
                            matter, returned the his bill [H. R. No. 4,] fixing the per diem and
                            mileage of members of the General Assembly, &c., striking out after
                            the enacting clause, and inserting new matter; per diem $5 a day mileage
                            12 cents a mile, with provisions relative to the election of officers,
                            &c.
                        The report and bill lied on the table.
                    
                    
                        ANN VIZARD.
                        Mr. BIRD (by consent,) from the select committee on that subject,
                            returned his bill, No. 71, for the relief of Ann Vizard, recommending
                            its passage.
                         On motion by Mr. HOGATE, Mr. Hamrick was added to the Committee
                                on Agriculutre. 
                        On motion by Mr. CHURCH, Mr. Hoover's bill, No. 83, with report of
                            corporations committee thereon, was taken from the table and referred
                            again to the committee on corporations. 
                        On motion of Mr. GOODMAN the House then took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                        
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The House met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                         On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the title of the bill No. 158 was
                            authenticated.

                        
                             THE MILITIA.
                            On the motion of Mr. TRUSLER, the House took up the special order,
                                viz: the consideration of his Militia bill, No. 94--[see page 141 of
                                these Reports, there erroneously ascribed to Mr. Buskirk]--with the
                                amendments thereto, reported from the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                             The bill was read through with the clerical and other immaterial
                                amendments of the Committee on Military Affairs,
                                [which was also taken for the second reading of the bill.]
                            On motion by Mr. HENRICKS these several amendments were concurred
                                in.
                            Mr. WOODS moved ineffectually to amend the first section by striking
                                out the word "white."
                            Mr. HIGGINS moved to strike out from the 3d section that which allows
                                compensation to the assessor for enrolling names.
                            Mr. H. said for what time the Assessor is occupied he is paid as
                                Assessor, according to law, $2 50 a day.
                             It was agreed to.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved to strike out the fourth "section." This was making
                                every citizen a spy or informer on his neighbor. It would promote
                                ill-will. He wanted to attend to his own business, and let his
                                neighbors do the same. It also inflicted a penalty of $20 for
                                failure to do so.
                             Mr. WRIGHT. This clause would facilitate the labors of the enrolling
                                officers.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. We could find plenty of informers on their neighbors
                                without offering a premium.
                            
                            
                             The section was stricken out--affirmative 59, negative 12.
                             Mr. COLLINS moved to strike out section 6. It was arbitrary and
                                unnecessary.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. It was clearly unconstitutional You could not imprison a
                                man for debt. 
                            Mr. RHOADS understood from the decision [16th Indiana Reports,] that
                                these fines were recoverable under the law of fines and fees, and he
                                thought this section unnecessary. But perhaps there would be a
                                better enforcement if we don't strike it out. 
                            Mr. HIGGINS. The law for the collection of fines was sufficient
                                without this provision.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. Fines were thus collectable in criminal proceedings. But
                                this section was clearly within the restriction of the Constitution. 
                            Mr. STRINGER was in favor of a section for the enforcement of the
                                collection of fines. But how was the judgment to be recovered
                                without the benefit of stay. If this was not amended he should vote
                                against the section.
                            Mr. MILLER. There was ample power for this in the 5th section, and he
                                was in favor of striking it out. 
                            Mr. HARRISON. It was not a fine, but a penalty on the relation of the
                                Adjutant General. It was an action of debt. He was not before aware
                                that a person could be imprisoned for costs.
                             The 6th section was stricken out.
                            Mr. LASSELLE proposed to amend section 5, by saying the fine "shall
                                not exceed $100," instead of positively "$100."
                            Mr. BURWELL moved to amend the 4th line of the 7th section, striking
                                out and inserting so as to read "to a fine not exceeding $100, to
                                which may be added imprisonment."
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, considered this case of fraud such as that
                                a man ought not to be fined less than $100. He moved to strike out
                                the first part of Mr. Burwell's amendment.
                            Mr. BURWELL. It ought to be less--in proportion to the grade of the
                                crime.
                            Mr. SHUEY was in favor of the bill. But in our good nature, in ten
                                minutes time, there would be no force in it. We had got it now, on
                                the amendment of Mr. Lasselle, already so that a man refusing to do
                                military service might be fined five cents.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK did not want to screen any one from just punishment. But
                                there ought tobe given a discretion to the court. As it now Hands,
                                the fine is "$100 and imprisonment." 
                            The amendment of Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe, was agreed to.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved to amend the amendment, so as to read "not less
                                than $25 nor more than $300.
                             This amendment was agreed to, and then the amendment as amended was
                                agreed to.
                            Mr. RHOADS moved to insert, after "dereliction," these words: "be
                                guilty of a misdemeanor and".
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to strike out from the 5th section these words:
                                "upon the complaint of the Adjutant General before any court record
                                in the State." 
                            Mr. RHOADS accepted that.
                            Mr. LASALLE showed the discrepancy of this section by which these
                                fines ''are transmitted to the credit of the State Military Fund,"
                                whereas all fines and forfeitures are to go into the common school
                                fund.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. The gentleman was right. The word "fine" should be
                                stricken out, and the word "penalty" put in its place. He moved to
                                recommit the bill to the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs.
                            It was so ordered.
                        

                        
                             NORMAL SCHOOL.
                            
                            
                            On motion of Mr.RHOADS, his Normal School bill [H. R. 119] was taken
                                up on the second reading.
                            On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, (the constitutional restriction being
                                suspended for the purpose--yeas 71, nays 5--) the bill was read the
                                second time by title, and 300 copies thereof ordered to be
                                printed.
                            On motion of Mr. EMERSON, the regular order of business was
                                suspended, and the House proceeded to the consideration of bills of
                                the House of Representatives on the third reading. 
                        
                        
                             SUPREME COURT.
                            Mr. Miller, of Tippecanoe's bill, [H. R. No. 2], relative to the
                                Supreme Court, and providing compensation for the judges thereof,
                                with the Judiciary Committee's amendments thereto, striking out and
                                restoring the Judges' salary to $3,000 per annum, coming up-
                            Mr. NEWCOMB described the bill as imposing important duties on the
                                judges, such as that of giving opinions to the Legislature on the
                                constitutionality of proposed legislation upon joint request of the
                                two Houses. He made an ineffectual motion for unanimous consent to
                                insert the words "or concurrent" between the words "joint" and
                                "resolution."
                            Mr. HIGGINS objected.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB presented considerations in favor of increasing the
                                salaries of the judges.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. The increase of salary met his approbation-$3,000 was
                                not too much-it should be more. But there was another feature in the
                                bill to which he was opposed-the seeking of the opinions of the
                                judges on constitutional questions by the General Assembly. It would
                                result in getting crude opinions. Judges were but lawyers. And there
                                were generally as good lawyers in the Legislature as the Supreme
                                Court Judges. The judicial mind could not arrive always at proper
                                conclusions without time to consult authorities. --It would result
                                in the decision of questions without proper investigation. It was
                                placing the judges in an embarrassing position. He had full
                                confidence in the competency, learning and fair-mindedness of the
                                present judges.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecenoe, had gone over this question before he
                                introduced the bill and notwithstanding the objections, he was still
                                in favor of this provision. Lawyers in the legislature usually
                                ranged on different sides in legislation, and they might not always
                                be in a condition as free from bias as the judges. Then it matters
                                not whether the Supreme Court deserves confidence or not, their
                                decision was law. Certainly as to the law was a great matter. There
                                had been more money expended in settling constitutional questions
                                than would  have paid the
                                salaries of the Judges four times over. For these and other reasons,
                                he considered this prevision important aim eminently proper. He
                                would now like to have such an opinion on the constitutionality of
                                soldiers' voting.
                            Mr. BURWELL coincided in the views of the bill taken by Mr. Coffroth.
                                He moved that the bill be recommitted with instructions.
                            Voices. "Object."
                            Mr. BUSKIRK knew that such a law had been enacted in other States. He
                                should vote against the bill, but not on account of the
                                salaries.
                            Mr. HIGGINS was opposed to increasing the Judges' salaries. We were
                                increasing the salaries of all the officers in the State. He hoped
                                the House would vote down the bill and all tendencies to further
                                increase the salaries of public officers.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. Whilst others were getting compensation three-fold,
                                There was no reason why Judges should work for nothing He argued for
                                the other provisions of the bill, taking some range, and replying to
                                objections, The Supreme Court made the law--they were above the
                                Legislature. He mentioned particularly the value of such a
                                consultation of the Judges on the Soldiers Vote bill. It would have
                                been invaluable, pending the consideration of the liquor law. As to
                                the allegation that the opinions would be crude, he was willing to
                                trust the court. The Judges would certainly be willing to set. The
                                Judges' opinion would end double legislation.
                            Mr. SPENCER opposed the consideration that this provision would wipe
                                out the Legislative department. He did not think the Judges would
                                thank us for giving them this labor.
                            The yeas and nays were taken on the final passage of the bill,
                                resulting--yeas 36, nays 36--as follows:

                        FRIDAY, February 17, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the minutes of yesterday's
                        proceedings was dispensed with. 
                    
                        REBEL RAIDS.
                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND, the Senate resolved itself into a
                                committee of the whole--Mr. Richmond in the
                            chair--and proceeded to consider the Morgan and other rebel raids bill,
                            [S. 15,] the question being on the pending amendment, striking out from
                            the bill all that relates to the appropriation of money from the
                            treasury.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, had not designed speaking to this question, but
                            observing the Senator from Kosciusko, [Mr. Chapman] who is entitled to
                            the floor, is not in his seat, he would consume the time till his
                            arrival in giving his reasons far the action he should take on this
                            measure. The Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Cobb,] assumes this bill
                            presents a case coming within the provisions of section 21, article 1 of
                            the State Constitution, to-wit: "No man's property shall be taken by law
                            without just compensation," but when he so assumes, he, as I thinks,
                            begs the whole question.
                        As I understand that clause of the Constitution, it means that you can
                            not by legislation, nor in pursuance of any existing law, take any man's
                            property for public purposes without just compensation, a meaning within
                            which the case presented by this bill does not come, for this property
                            was taken by either the military power of the country, or by a common
                            enemy, in other words, it was taken either by a power not within the
                            spirit of the words "taken by law," or it perished by the calamity of
                            war, a misfortune for which there is no legal remedy. 
                        But supposing the Constitituional provision referred to, supports the
                            view of the Senator, it carries but a part of the measure. For the rest,
                            however, he appeals to our moral obligations, our sense of justice. Our
                            moral obligations, our sense of justice, sir, impels us equally to
                            regard the interests of all the citizens of the State and to refuse to
                            burden the people for the benefit of the few. Indiana has already borne
                            more than her full share of the public burden. No other State has out of
                            its own funds lent so much aid to the General Government. And yet,
                            gentlemen cry out for still further imposition upon our little State of
                            the burdens of the General Government. The Senator for Kosciusko has now
                            appeared in his seat, I therefore, yield the floor.
                        
                        Mr. CHAPMAN having offered the pending amendment, preferred to make the
                            few remarks he had to offer, after the Senators had said all they wanted
                            to. 
                        Mr. NILES moved to amend as follows:

                        
                            Insert after the word "testimony," in the second
                                line of section 9, these words: "dividing the claims so established
                                into two classes, namely: 1st. Such as were for property taken, or
                                impressed by the forces of this State, with the description and
                                value thereof belonging to each claimant; and 2d. Such as were for
                                property taken or destroyed by the rebel forces."
                        
                        
                             After the word "each," in the seventh line of the
                                9th section, insert the following: "for the sums so allowed such
                                claimants, respectively, for property so taken by the forces of the
                                State."
                        
                        
                             Also, amend by striking out section 13. 
                        
                        Mr. NILES insisted that the claims of the first class were just, and
                            ought to be paid, but that there was no obligation, legal or moral, on
                            the part of the State, to pay the other class. We may do so out of
                            sympathy; but injuries caused by public enemies are, according to the
                            principles of national law and universal usage civilized nations,
                            regarded in the light of inevitable calamities, like the destruction of
                            property by the elements. We might as well be required to pay for stolen
                            horses, and buildings burnt by incendiaries. Mr. N. continued his
                            remarks at some length.
                        Mr. DUNNING had not a constituent interested to the amount of five cents
                            in this matter, nor had be the slightest claim in it himself; but as an
                            act of justice he contended that it is the duty of the State of Indiana
                            to protect her citizens in their persons and property, and to indemnify
                            those parties who have suffered by rebel raids. He was surprised that
                            the Senator from Laporte should look on this question as one of
                            sympathy, and hardly that --though sympathy is a noble trait when nobly
                            exercised. He read and endorsed the remarks on the Morgan raid made by
                            the Governor in his late biennial message, and also acquiesced in the
                            theory of civil government as laid down by His Excellency. After being
                            robbed, we propose to pay our share of taxation toward defraying the
                            debt which may be incurred by reimbursing the sufferers in this bill
                            applying for relief. The bill proposes to guard the appropriation well
                            which it makes; and it should be passed by this legislature without
                            unnecessary debate.
                        Mr. HANNA. Mr. President: I do not intend to occupy the attention of the
                            committee at any length, but simply to state the proposition before the
                            committee, as I understand it, and the motives that will control me in
                            the vote, I will give in the premises.
                        The original bill provides for the creation of a commission, to determine
                            the actual amount of damages sustained on the part of citizens of
                            Indiana by the invasion of a foreign enemy--partly as the result of that
                            invasion, and partly as the result of its expulsion-and for the
                            indemnification of such losses out of the Treasury' of the State. The
                            amendment also proposes to make the investigation, and when the measure
                            of damages has teen ascertained, to report the same to the proper
                            department at Washington, with a view to get this indemnification at the
                            hands of the Federal Government. The Senator from Laporte [Mr. Niles]
                            favors a division of the question. He thinks the citizens of Indiana may
                            be indemnified so far as damages have been sustained at the bands of
                            Federal troops, bet seems to argue that there is no relief anywhere for
                            damages resulting at the hands of an invading enemy.
                        The law produced yesterday by the Senator from Kosciusko [Mr. Chapman]
                            provides only for damages sustained at the hands of the United States
                            forces. I might, with equal propriety, suggest another division of the
                            question, upon the views advanced by gentlemen on the other side. I ask
                            what becomes of the damages inflicted by the militia of Indiana?
                        I was very much pleased the other day to see the distinguished President
                            of the Senate [Mr. Baker] take the position he did. He has a legal mind
                            that will naturally drift him into the right channels. He has fallen
                            into my favorite theory of States rights. But while I enjoyed the
                            pleasure of seeing him take the right direction in this discussion, I
                            was at the same time surprised at my Democratic friend over the way [Mr.
                            Corbin] in suddenly assuming the attitude and heresies of
                            federalism.
                        I was pleased with the measure of the Senator from Laporte, providing
                            against riots and mobs-making the counties and cities responsible far
                            damages resulting therefrom, when they shall be sustained. The principle
                            is just, and is kindred to the pending measure.
                        I hold, Sir, that the State of Indiana is clearly liable in moral
                            principles, and in the spirit of good government, for losses sustained
                            by her citizens at the hands of our militia. I believe the Federal
                            Government is equally liable, and for similar reasons, for damages
                            imposed by Federal troops, and an invading army. But while I hold to
                            this principle, I also believe that we have a legal discretion, and upon
                            that discretion I am disposed to act to-day. I stand upon the theory of
                            States rights. The people need immediate relief; let us give it to them,
                            and look to the General Government for the repayment of the money we
                            shall advance. I am, therefore, Mr. Chairman, for the original bill, and
                            against the amendment.
                        Mr. ENGLISH said his farm was the turning point of the three armies in
                            this raid, and he had thought of saying nothing on the subject because
                            he was pecuniarily interested, but finding that gentlemen want to place
                            their action upon sympathy, he felt it a duty to say that before he
                            would ask to be reimbursed upon that ground, he would suffer almost any
                            penalty. He contended that the General Government owed it to her
                            citizens to protect them in their property, and to repay the men who
                            lost property in this raid; for many of his neighbors would make oath
                            that horses taken by the State forces were turned over to the United
                            States troops these animals that were found fit for service. He did not
                            want to live in a country that did not protect him and that would drive
                            him to protect it.
                        Mr. ALLISON did not desire to see geographical lines drawn on this
                            Question, and protested that his constituents do not come here claiming
                            sympathy; they would bear their wrongs in silence rather than beg for
                            sympathy. He contended that these claims should be adjusted and paid by
                            the State, and the State should look to the General Government  for reimbursement. This burden
                            should be borne by the people of the whole State, and not be left wholly
                            upon a small portion of our citizens, who are already overburdened in
                            consequence of their peculiar geographical position. He argued the
                            justice of the measure before the Senate, but earnestly protested
                            against the adoption of the proposed amendments. There were wrongs
                            pernetrated in that raid that can never be righted; but you can restore
                            money that will pay for the property which was robbed and wrung from us,
                            and we demand re-payment for it aa a matter of justice and of high moral
                            right.--You can never pay the wife and children of those fathers and
                            husbands who were murdered by Morgan's rebel gang in money, and if
                            Senators have sympathy to spare they may bestow it upon those widows and
                            orphans.--What I ask for my constituents is justice not sympathy. We are
                            not here in the character of supplicants, but as independent freemen
                            demanding our rights. We are much obliged to gentlemen for their kind
                            words, but we desire something more substantial.
                        Mr. STAGGS felt disposed to vote for this bill as it was originally
                            introduced, upon the principal of justice, and not upon the plea of
                            sympathy. He felt satisfied his constituents would justify him in this
                            course, and consequently he was opposed to the amendment.
                        Mr. HORD. I feel it due to my constituents to say a word in reference to
                            the measure under discussion. General Wallace, at the head of the State
                            militia, while passing through our county, pressed into the service a
                            great many horses, for which our citizens have never received any
                            compensation.
                        Protection and allegiance are reciprocal-one is given in consideration of
                            the other. It is evident that the State was neglectful in securing that
                            protection. It is man's weakness and fear that leads him to create
                            government, and protection to the citizen being the object of
                            government, a failure to give that protection creates a liability on the
                            State for the payment of the losses accruing from an absence of it. It
                            is urged by some Senators that the liability rests upon the General
                            Government, and not upon the State, as it is the duty of the General
                            Government to secure the States against invasion. Is it any less the
                            duty of the State to protect its own citizens from invasion? If a
                            liabity is created on the General Government from its duty to protect,
                            there is no less a liability on the State for the same reason. If the
                            State pays off these losses, the General Government will reimburse her,
                            and the only way to secure payment to the citizen and a reimbursement to
                            ourselves from the General Government is for us to assume the payment of
                            the claims, and show our appreciation of the justice of the measure, and
                            thereby give confidence as to the propriety of the payment.
                        The Senator from Marshall urges that the bill is unconstitutional under
                            sections 5 and 6 of article 10 of the Constitution. Section 5, with a
                            view to prohibit the State from borrowing money in an unlimited way,
                            prescribes in what cases the State can contract a debt, and is intended
                            only to prevent the unlimited borrowing of money by the State. And this
                            measure does not propose to borrow money, or to contract a debt; and
                            there is surely an existing liability on her to pay these losses. If the
                            Senator's construction is correct there is no power in the Legislature
                            to make appropriations for any purpose. We could not appropriate to pay
                            the expenses of the Legislature, as the logic of his position would
                            construe it as contracting a debt. The sixth section prohibits the State
                            from assuming the debt of any county, corporation, &c. This bill
                            does not propose any such assumption of debt. It proposes to pay our own
                            liability, imposed by our neglect to perform our duty in giving
                            protection.
                        It is strange that men became so scrupulous. The opponents of this bill,
                            in a great measure, are those who gratuitously gave to Lanier & Co.,
                            strangers to our State, 7 per cent, upon some money advanced by them for
                            the State, when there was no legal liability on the State to pay it. And
                            when our citizens seek a payment of themselves, these same gentlemen
                            have visions of onerous taxation. These men who are to be paid have to
                            bear their portion of the taxation to pay the debt, and the services of
                            the border citizens in protecting the border against invasion, who have
                            their business and homes for that purpose; can well be set off against
                            the taxation to be paid by the northern citizens of our State, and it is
                            not just that northern Senators should complain.
                        Mr. CORBIN contended that this bill was a technical evasion of the
                            Constitution, in that it contracted a debt, and referred to several
                            clauses in the State Constitution to show the truthfulness of the
                            argument.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS thought the opponents of of the bill were acting upon the
                            principles which lies at the foundation of selfish motives. If we have a
                            State Government it is the duty of the State to remunerate her citizens
                            for losses sustained by invasion. He opposed the amendment and favored
                            the original bill.
                         Mr. VAWTER spoke in opposition to both amendments. The latter is more
                            dangerous than the forme.r If we pay one part and not pay the other, it
                            is virtually saying to the General Government that the Morgan claim is
                            not a just one. In advocating this bill he had no friends to reward, and
                            no enemies to punish--had no pecuniary interest in it, and never
                            expected to have. He advocated it because it was right, and not because
                            of sympathy for the sufferers. We want no sympathy unless it comes with
                            greenbacks or gold coin, that will afford relief to the sufferers. He
                            cited cases of peculiar hardship brought about by the rebel raiders; and
                            referred to the labors ofa commission which examined and passed upon
                            many of the claims which are covered by the bill before the Senate. 
                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND, the Committee rose, reported progress, and
                            obtained leave to sit again this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
                    
                    
                        ILLUMINATING GAS.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced the Committee to which was referred the
                            bill S. 137 (see page 162 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) viz: Messrs. Brown,
                            of Wells, Allison and Hanna.
                         And then came the recess for dinner. 
                    
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        Leaves of absence were asked and obtained for Messrs. Dykes and Eyatt,
                            till Wednesday; for Messrs. Moore and Hord till Tuesday; Mr. Cason till
                            the last of next week, and Mr. McClurg during next week.
                         On motion by Mr. DUNNING, Messrs. English and Richmond were added to the
                                Committee on States Prison.

                        
                            BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                            Mr. RICHMOND suggested that we write out our remarks on the
                                constitutional amendment question, give them to the reporter, and
                                let them go into the Brevier Reports. He would like for his
                                Democratic constituents and for his Republican constituents to know
                                the reasons why he gave the most important vote he ever expected to
                                give during the whole course of his life; and he would like to be
                                permitted to place a few of these reasons on record, that they may
                                go to the world with the speeches already made on this question by
                                gentlemen on the floor of the Senate. 
                            Mr. TERRY joined most fully in the suggestions of the gentleman from
                                Howard, [Mr. Richmond]. There are few of us here under peculiar
                                circumstances. Two years ago the district in which he lived gave 500
                                Democratic majority. He was elected by a very small majority, and if
                                this matter had entered the canvass he doubted whether he should
                                have been here at all, and for that reason he believed that his
                                constituents should know why he gave the vote he did on the
                                constitutional amendment. He desired to set himself right before his
                                constituents. Ha submitted whether it would not be better that we
                                have the privilege of giving our speeches to the reporter in the
                                manner designated.
                            Mr. RICHMOND then moved that all those Senators who had not an
                                opportunity of giving their views upon the proposed amendment to the
                                Constitution of the United States be permitted to write them out,
                                and that they appear in the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                            The motion was agreed to, and it was so ordered by unanimous
                                consent.
                        
                        
                            REBEL RAIDS.
                            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the vote granting leave to the
                                    Committee of the Whole to sit at 2 o'clock
                                was reconsidered.
                            Mr. BRADLEY moved to recommit the bill, with instructions to amend as
                                follows:
                            
                                1st. By inserting at the proper place: "for the adjudication
                                    of all claims for property taken or destroyed by our State
                                    trops, or troops under State authority, and that the same be
                                    paid out of the State treasury."
                                2d. By inserting at the proper place: "for the taking of
                                    testimony with reference to all property taken and destroyed,
                                    and remaining unpaid, by the forces of the United States, and
                                    also all the property taken and destroyed by the rebel forces,
                                    and that all the claims be officially certified by our officers
                                    of State, to the General Government, with a request that it pay
                                    the same."
                            
                            
                            On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the motion to recommit was laid on the table
                                by yeas 26, nays 18.
                            On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the regular order of business was dispensed
                                with, and the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the Morgan
                                and other rebel raids bill [S. 15,] the question being on the
                                pending amendment striking from the bill all that relates to the
                                appropriation of money from the treasury.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN discussed the question: Who is obliged to protect the
                                citizen? There is no other excepting the General Government. That is
                                the power affording protection to the citizen. It was the duty of
                                the General Government to protect our citizens from this raid.
                                Coming to the conclusion that it was not brought about by the
                                direction of the State of Indiana, he then considered the loss of
                                property by the rebels, by the General Government and by the militia
                                of the State. Whenever you can trace properly, even if taken by John
                                Morgan himself, into the hands of the General Government the General
                                Government most assuredly must pay the losses under the force, of
                                printed regulations from which he read. There could be no doubt but
                                that property taken by the Federal troops would be paid for by the
                                General Government. The class of claims for property taken by the
                                militia is so small that it is said they do not amount to a
                                sufficient sum to ask reimbursement for or to quarrel about on the
                                floor of the Senate. Then he was very clear in the opinion that the
                                General Government is the party to whom application should bs made
                                for damages sustained by this raid, and not the State of Indiana.
                                This bill would open the door for the payment of all bridges
                                destroyed and steamboats burned.
                            Mr. VAWTER understood that the steamboat claim has already been
                                adjusted.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN was of opinion that the State, while the United States
                                were warring with rebellion, could not protect herself; and it was
                                certainly the duty of the General Government to protect the State
                                and the citizens thereof; and having failed in that, the General
                                Government must make reparation for damages sustained in
                                consequence. For one, he was not willing to pay taxes to raise a
                                fund that shall be used in paying damages the General Government
                                should pay. As a State, we a have to provide annually for about one
                                and a half millions of dollars, and the taxes amount to about 85
                                cents on the $100 valuation. Appropriations and claims have been
                                presented for $4,500,000 already. Our people are heavily taxed now,
                                and it is the part of prudent legislators not to add unnecessarily
                                to the already burdensome taxes our citizens have to pay.
                            Mr. NILES offered the same amendments he submitted in
                                    Committee of the Whole, except the last,
                                striking out section 13.
                            Mr. COBB was of the opinion that if a division be made in the classes
                                of claims, much difficulty would be encountered. The sure way to do
                                justice is to vote for the bill aboriginally introduced. There is no
                                claim upon earth more just than this. The State only makes a
                                temporary loan to the Government; and when the claim against the
                                General Government is preferred by the State it will be considered,
                                whereas the claim of the individual sufferer would be put off from
                                time to time, and probably for all time. He regarded the amendment
                                is a death stroke to the bill, and with all kindness to the author
                                of it, would like to see it laid, on the table.
                            
                            Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President: I hope the amendment of the Senator from
                                Laporte [Mr. Niles] may be adopted. That the people of Indiana are
                                willing to pay for all property Impressed into the service,
                                destroyed or damaged by the military forces of the country in
                                repelling the guerrillas under John Morgan, I have no doubt. But you
                                might as well ask them to pay for all the calamities that have come
                                upon the State for the last five years by fire and flood as to
                                compel them by law to pay far horses stolen and property destroyed
                                by this band of thieves. No government, as I understand, can follow
                                up the pathway of war and repair its wide-spread ruin. War is a
                                terrible scourge to the nation, and it is a great misfortune for
                                those who fall in the way of its calamity. But then their losses are
                                nothing in comparison with the families whose only support has
                                fallen in the battle field while driving back the rebel foe. And yet
                                this Senate would not entertain for a moment a proposition to pay
                                every poor widow or helpless orphan for the loss of their only
                                protector. Then let those claims be adjudicated and classified
                                according to the plan proposed by the amendment. Indiana will pay
                                for all property impressed for the use of the military forces, and
                                the claims predicated on the destruction and theft of John Morgan's
                                band can be presented for future legislation.
                            Mr. VAWTER moved to lay both amendments on the table.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN demanded a division of the question.

                            On motion of Mr. OYLER the amendment was amended by
                                substituting''$8'' for ' $10" yeas 34, nays 7.

                            Section 12 being read--
                            Mr. CHAPMAN moved to amend by inserting "one" instead of "three"

                                claims.

                                And any acceptance by any person of the pro
                                    rata share of their said claim, to which they may be entitled
                                    to, under the provisions of this shall be deemed and considered
                                    a full satisfaction of their raid claim.
                            
                            Sections 13 and 14 were adopted by consent.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to reconsider the vote by which the Senate agreed
                                that the commission should consist of "one." He desired to amend so
                                that there should be three commissioners.

                            Mr. VAWTER made an ineffectual motion-yeas 10, nays 32-to lay the
                                amendment on the table.
                            The amendment was agreed to by yeas 29, nays 14

                            On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the bill was amended by providing that no
                                claim shall be allowed to any person or persons other than those to
                                whom the loss as originally accrued; or to their legal heirs,
                                executors or administrators, and that such fact shall be established
                                by affidavit of the claimant.
                            Mr. TERRY moved to reconsider the vote by which the third section was
                                adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                table.

                                numbered 14 and 15.
                            
                            Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion--yeas 18, nays 24--to lay the
                                amendment on the table.
                            The amendment was then adopted.

                            AGRICULTURAL REPORTS.
                            On motion by Mr. CARSON, it was
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Committee

                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        FRIDAY, February 17, 1865.
                    
                     The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed the roll-call to
                        ascertain a quorum.
                    
                    On motion of Mr. BECKETT, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with. 
                    On motion of Mr. SPENCER, Mr. Burton and Mr. Abbett had leave of absence on
                        account of sickness.
                    
                        DOG LAW.
                        The SPEAKER announced the special order for this hour, vis: the
                            consideration of Mr. Shoaff, of Allen's, Dog bill, No. 8-[see p. 41]--and the pending
                            amendments reported by the select committee thereon, the bill being on
                            the third reading.
                         The amendments are chiefly clerical-inserting the words "or harbored,"
                            so as to include dogs owned by boys-making the tax on each dog $1,
                            instead of 50c.; and providing that nothing in this act shall conflict
                            with the act of June 15, 1852, entitled an act for the protection of
                            sheep--[the bill provides that the county tax fund over $50 for damages
                            for sheep killed should go to the school fund.]
                        Mr. BUSKIRK asked and obtained leave of absence for a short time far the
                            special committee on the bill from the Senate, [No. 3] for legalizing
                            county bonds.
                        Mr. COLLINS. The changes were not material. We put the words "or
                            harbored," to include dogs owned by boys, and increase the tax from
                            fifty cents to one dollar,
                        The amendments reported from the Special Committee
                            were severally concurred in.
                        
                        The bill was then read the third time by the Clerk, considered as
                            engrossed, and passed the final reading in the House of
                            Representatives-yeas 64, nays 10-Messrs. Groan, Glazebrook, Humphrey,
                            James, Lemon, Osborn, Richards, Richardson, Roach and White voting in
                            the negative.
                        The title was amended by inserting the words "end providing a fund
                            "-striking out and inserting these words: ''Provided that nothing in
                            this act shall be construed to conflict with the provisions of the act
                            of June 15, 1852, for the protection of sheep."
                        So the bill passed.
                        A message from the Senate announced the passage of a concurrent
                            resolution in that body, for the due celebration of Washington's birth
                            day anniversary, and appointing on their part a special committee of
                            arrangements for that purpose.

                            the change of court terms in said county, and reported a bill for the
                            correction of the wrong complained of.
                        The bill goes on the calendar.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, returned the
                            memorials for claims of James Douglass for $442 65; of James Mahoney, of
                            A. Wilson, $1,075; of James Walker, and of Speigel, Thoms & Co.,
                            which were referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                Means, with instructions that they be incorporated in the
                            Specific Appropriation bill.

                        Mr. JAMES submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, By the House of Representatives,
                                        (the Senate concurring,) That a joint committee, to consist
                                        of three members of the Committee on
                                            Corporations, of the House of Representatives,
                                        and three members of the Committee on
                                            Corporations, of the Senate, be appointed; and
                                        that all bills to amend the general law for the
                                        incorporation of cities be referred to that committee, with
                                        instructions to report a new bill to take the place of the
                                        act of 1857, and embodying all amendments to said act, and
                                        all amendments, which in the judgment of said committee,
                                        ought to be made thereto.
                                
                            
                        
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED.
                        
                        Mr. WOODS (by consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 173] for an act to amend
                            the act entitled an act to encourage the destruction of wolves, approved
                            June 9, 1852: [$10 for a scalp]-$1 to $5 for a wolf less than three
                            months old :]
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Agriculture.
                        On motion of Mr. COFFROTH, Mr. Newcomb's Railroad bill [H. R. 59] was
                            taken up and made the special order for this afternoon, two o'clock.
                        Mr. KILGORE introduced a bill [H. R. 174] for an act for the protection
                            of fish in any river, stream, lake or pond in this State, except the
                            Ohio river and Lake Michigan--
                        Which was passed the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on Rights and Privileges.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, asked and obtained leave for the introduction
                            of the Committee bill submitted by him this morning, viz: a bill [H. R.
                            175] for an act supplemental to an act fixing the times of holding the
                            Circuit Courts in the 11th Judicial Circuit--
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe moved that the constitutional restriction be
                            suspended that the bill may be read the second time now.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE desired the suspension.
                        Mr. COFFROTH would have the bill referred to a special committee. From
                            the reading, he thought it conflicted with the courts in Huntington
                            county.
                        The SPEAKER. The motion is not debatable.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE wished to avoid delay.
                        Mr. MILLER did not withdraw his motion, but was willing to leave the
                            matter to the members from the territory interested.
                        
                        The House refused to suspend the restriction--yeas 42, nays 31.
                        On motion of Mr. COFFROTH the bill was then referred to a select
                            committee to consist of the Representatives from the several counties of
                            the 11th Circuit. 
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM introduced a bill [H. R.
                                176] for an act making general appropriations for the years
                            1865 and 1866
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that the constitutional restriction foe suspended to
                            admit of the second reading to-day.
                        The motion was rejected--yeas 47, nays 25--two-thirds not voting in the
                            affirmative.
                        Mr. THACHER introduced a bill [H. R. 177] for an act to amend section 143
                            of the act amendatory of the act for the publication of delinquent
                            taxes, approved May 31st 1861. [25 cents a line for the publication of
                            the notice.]
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Public Printing.
                    
                    
                        PER DIEM AND MILEAGES.
                        On motion by Mr. MEREDITH the House proceeded to the consideration of
                            bills in the calendar on the third reading.
                        Mr. Griffith's bill [H. R. 4] fixing the per diem and mileage of members
                            of the General Assembly, &c., coming up--
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Reese in the chair) stated the question to be on
                            concurrence in the amendments of the select committee.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH stated the provisions of the bill proposed to be amended-the
                            per diem $5, mileage 12 cents--elective officers $5 a day--their
                            assistants, such as shall be fixed by each House. He urged
                            considerations in favor of the proposed increase of pay.
                        Mr. LOCK HART was opposed to raising the pay at this time. It was very
                            bad policy now, for there never was a time when money had been so
                            lavishly expended.
                        While our fellow citizens were in the field, certainly members here could
                            afford to make personal sacrifices in the service of the State.
                        Mr. SIM. With the present value of greenbacks, it was difficult for
                            members to pay their way. He considered the soldier at $16 a month, with
                            rations and bounty, was doing better than members.
                        Mr. SHUEY suggested that this bill did not effect us at this session, and
                            if an increase of pay should be inconvenient gentlemen could stay at
                            home hereafter. He was willing to go on the record for $5 a day. He
                            would not represent a niggardly constituency.
                        Mr. SIM. If we were to make it eight dollars, his constituents would say
                            amen to it.
                        Mr. HENRICK should not vote for the bill. He would not raise the
                            compensation at this time; and he deprecated the indirection by which
                            members had already increased their pay through the stationery order. He
                            looked at the awkwardness of our position to raise our own salary, and
                            not that of the local county officers. He did not come here for pay. He
                            could do better at home. Service for money was a poor recommendation for
                            a representative.
                        Mr. GROVES would not kick at raising the salaries of officers. It was
                            poor economy to appropriate meager pay for public service. Such a policy
                            would call none but rich men to office. His people would not justify him
                            in opposing this bill. He would increase directly. He would have no
                            indirection. He deprecated timidity and modesty in this matter. Five
                            dollars a day never was too mush for a Representative.
                        Mr. HARRISON was willing to go on the record in favor of the bill. Ten or
                            fifteen years ago, when the present compensation was fixed, he supposed
                            it was deemed sufficient to accommodate members with living convenient
                            to the Capitol. But this object having failed by the change of times,
                            the compensation should now be increased.
                        
                        Mr. MEREDITH demanded the previous question, but there was not a second-
                            affirmative 44, negative 18--no quorum voting.
                        Whereupon the PRESIDING OFFICER directed the roll-call when a quorum (71)
                            answered.
                        Mr. COFFROTH made an ineffectual motion to send for the absentees.
                        There was then a second to the demand for the previous question, and
                            under its force the amendments were adopted.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH moved that the bill be considered as engrossed and ordered
                            to the third reading.
                        Mr. HENRICKS insisted that the motion is not in order under the force of
                            the previous question.
                        The SPEAKER sustained Mr. Henricks.
                        The bill was then ordered the third reading and read the third time.
                        The yeas and nays being called on the final passage of the bill
                            resulted--yeas 28, nays 51--as follows:

                                        Stivers, Upson, Veach, Welch, Whiteside and Willis--28.

                                        Coffroth, Collins, Cox, Croan, Emerson, Foulke, Ferris,
                                        Goodman, Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory of Warren, Hamrick,
                                        Hargrove, Henricks, Hershey, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover, Hunt,
                                        James, Johnson, Kilgore, Lane, Lemon, Lockhart, Major,
                                        Montgomery, O'Brien, Patterson, Perigo, Richards,
                                        Richardson, Riford, roach, Sabin, Shoaff, of Jay, Shuey,
                                        Sim, Spencer, Stewart, Stringer, Sullivan, of Scott,
                                        Thactcher, Trusler, White, Woodruff, Woods, Wright and Mr.
                                        Speaker--51.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the bill was rejected.
                        Mr. HENRICKS moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that
                            motion on the table.
                        Mr. SPENCER inquired if that motion could be divided.
                         The SPEAKER. The Chair understands that it cannot. 
                        Mr. GRIFFITH demanded the yeas and nays.
                         Mr. LASSELLE moved to indefinitely postpone Mr. Henrick's motion.
                         The SPEAKER decided that the chair could not entertain the motion to
                            postpone.
                        Mr. KILGORE appealed from the decision of the Chair.
                         The SPEAKER. There is no appeal till matter is submitted in writing.
                         Mr. KILGORE. Rather than take the trouble to write the appeal, he would
                            withdraw it.
                        Mr. VEACH made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                        The yeas and nays were then taken, resulting--yeas 32, nays 46--as
                            follows:

                         So the House refused to lay the motion to reconsider on the table; and
                            the question, recurred: Shall the vote rejecting the bill be
                            reconsidered? and the yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken
                            thereon, the result was --yeas 36, nays 41--as follows:

                        So the House refused to reconsider the bill.
                    
                    
                        COUNTY BONDS.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, from the select committee on that subject, returned the
                            bounty legalizing bill from the Senate No. 3, reporting amendments by way of a new bill.
                        A majority of the select committee concurred in recommending a motion,
                            that Mr. Wright's amendment, as amended by Mr. Whiteside, be laid on the
                            table.

                        The bill, as now reported, embraces the essential features of the Senate
                            bill, viz: That all bonds or orders heretofore issued and all
                            appropriations made by county commissioners and incorporated cities and
                            towns in this State, for the purpose of procuring volunteers, soldiers
                            or substitutes, or for the relief of their families or the families of
                            drafted men, volunteers or substitutes, be and the same are hereby
                            ratified, affirmed and legalized.
                        
                             It provides further, That county commissioners and
                                municipal authorities shall levy and collect a tax sufficient to
                                redeem at least one-third of such appropriations in each of the
                                years 1865, 1866 and 1867. The provisions of the act shall not be
                                construed to, cover debts contracted by any company or corporation
                                to relieve themselves from any draft, nor to authorize in any manner
                                the assumption of such debt?; but they are to apply exclusively to
                                the acts of the people through their legally constituted authorities
                                to raise money to pay volunteers, drafted men, or substitutes, or to
                                support their families.
                             It shall not be lawful, after the present quota of the
                                State shall be filled, for such authorities to appropriate money or
                                issue bonds or orders for these purposes.
                             Repealing conflicting: laws, &c.
                             Adding a clause, declaring an emergency for instant
                                effect.
                        
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. Inasmuch as many were not satisfied on this question, and
                            as there was to be a minority report, he moved that the House
                            adjourn.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was willing to allow the minority report to go on the
                            journal, but urged immediate action on the bill.
                        The SPEAKER gave the opinion that this matter, involving the power of
                            taxation, should be considered in Committee of the
                                Whole.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. As these counties, cities and towns act by authority
                            delegated by the Legislature, he thought the Chair was right. He,
                            therefore, moved that this matter be referred to the Committee
                                of the Whole, and made the special order for consideration
                            at 3 o'clock this afternoon.
                        The order was taken by consent, informally.
                    
                    
                        TWENTY-SECOND OF FEBRUARY.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, (by unanimous consent.) moved to take up the Senate
                            concurrent resolution, with reference to the celebration of the
                            anniversary of Washiogton's birth day.
                        The resolution was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        SPECIAL COMMITTEES.
                        
                        The SPEAKER announced the following Special Committees: For the Committee
                            on part of the House under the concurrent resolution just
                            adopted--Messrs. Newcomb, Griffith and Lane.
                        Special Committee on the cities and towns bill--Messrs. Hamrick, Buskirk
                            and Foulke.
                        The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.

                        
                            TOBACCO INSPECTION.
                            On motion by Mr. MEREDITH, the special order was deferred, and the
                                House took up Mr. Cook's bill, No. 22, to amend the 6th and 10th
                                sections of the act of February 12, 1857, to regulate the inspection
                                of tobacco, and it was read by the Clerk.
                            
                            The bill was passed the final reading-yeas 65, nays 2.
                        
                        
                            WHITEWATER VALLEY RAILROAD.
                            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: Mr. Newcomb's bill, No.
                                59, to authorize railroad companies to use the property of canal
                                companies, &c.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, made an Ineffectual motion to postpone the
                                special order till two o'clock to-morrow.
                            Mr. Newcomb's bill, No. 59, was then read through by the Clerk,
                                together with the amendments of the majority and minority of the
                                    Committee on Railroads, which were described
                                yesterday morning in these Reports.
                            Mr. LOCKHART said this bill elicited a good deal of interest. He was
                                not satisfied with the bill. There were constitutional
                                objections-the exemption from its provisions of the Wabash and Erie
                                canal. If this canal was to be diverted from its original purpose,
                                it ought to be sold to the highest and best bidder. It might be that
                                the Whitewater Canal was worthless, as it was alleged by same, but
                                the  water power should not be
                                infringed. But parties bad got hold of this property, and were
                                asking for this legislation. Other parties were remonstrating
                                against the diversion of this canal. They ask for justice-that this
                                canal shall be sold and the canal debts paid. Were not the grading
                                and embankments valuable? He did not want to injure the people of
                                the Whitewater valley, nor the people of Franklin county.
                            Gentlemen had threatened him with the repudiation of his people; but
                                he could not be driven from his purpose to subserve the best
                                interests of the State. Gentlemen cannot suppose that parties will
                                give more than this property is worth, and let it lie idle and
                                worthless.
                            Mr. COFFROTH should be sorry if the people of this valley were minded
                                to destroy the gentleman's reputation. He had made a manly
                                opposition. But the gentleman's amendment, in no manner, conflicts
                                with the bill. The great majority of those remonstrances come from
                                the millers along the canal-sent up under a false impression that
                                the hydraulic power would be infringed; and they had been here, and
                                had gone away satisfied, withdrawing their opposition. The real
                                opposition was from rival lines of railroad. The people there
                                earnestly desired this bill-it was their only hope for a railroad.
                                He showed at length the reasons for the bill, giving the History of
                                the construction of the Whitewater canal, now far a considerable
                                time wholly abandoned-only occasionally a boat for neighborhood
                                traffic.
                            The canal was now wholly used for hydraulic purposes, which would be
                                very valuable but for the expense of keeping up the water power.
                                This was one of the most fertile portions of the State. It had no
                                outlet for the produce. This was the reason why people were
                                clamorous fur this legislation. [Ten minutes expires.]
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. There was but one reason he had to offer
                                for this amendment. This right of way seemed to have become valuable
                                for a railroad. Then was it not just that it should bs sold and the
                                funds applied - to the canal debts? A railroad company must purchase
                                it for a railroad. He would not exclude that people from the
                                advantages of a railroad. But as he understood this bill, this
                                matter was fixed up for a particular company. He wanted justice to
                                the creditors of the canal company. He would also like to know how
                                the gentleman from Washington would explain the constitutionality of
                                the provision exempting the Wabash Canal in a general law?
                            Mr. COFFROTH answered. The canal had been long bankrupt and in the
                                hands of a receiver, and that receiver had not yet paid a cent. It
                                had been necessary for a Cincinnati railroad to advance money to
                                keep up the water power. But there was not one of the creditors of
                                that canal company, except the Junction Railroad Company, that was
                                not in favor of this bill. Liens had been attached to that property.
                                The idea of selling it to the highest bidder was plausible, but the
                                difficulty was this: if it be sold, it will pass into hands that
                                will build no railroad. The Hamilton and Dayton Railroad Company, a
                                strong company, owns the Junction Railroad. If exposed to sale, the
                                Junction will be in a condition to pay twice as much as it is worth.
                                It was the interest of those counties of the State of Indiana, and
                                against the interest of the Junction road, owned by a foreign
                                corporation.
                            Again: Suppose another road, builds, besides the Indianapolis and
                                Cincinnati--there was no possible room to construct the road from
                                Lawrenceburg to Cincinnati.
                            The Indianapolis and Cincinnati road had to buy the bed of the canal
                                from Ohio parties at almost a ruinous charge. No road could be built
                                in the hill country back of the river. So that none but the
                                Indianapolis and Cincinnati road could do this work so much desired
                                by those, people. The first and largest lien on the Canal Company,
                                belonged to Mr. Lord, for the Cincinnati Company. The interests of
                                all parties were protected by the bill-the State was not to become
                                responsible for the canal debts-the hydraulic power was not to be
                                infringed. This bill was demanded by the interests of the canal. It
                                was provided also, that if the canal fail to preserve the hydraulic
                                power, another company may be organized by the lessees or others, to
                                keep it up. He had an amendment which he intended to apply to the
                                third line, to this effect: Strike out "Wabash and Erie Canal," and
                                insert these words: "The provisions of this act shall not apply to
                                any canal now in the hands of Trustees, or which has been taken, or
                                which is in any way held as security for the public debt." He
                                thought this would obviate the constitutional objection. He read
                                from section 23 of the State Constitution, requiring all laws to be
                                of a general character. This is a general law, with an exception.
                                There were exceptions to all laws, human, divine or natural. The
                                Judge's salaries act was not like this, nor the late Temperance
                                law.
                            The Supreme Court say that it is competent for the Court to make an
                                exception ; and if the Court, how much more the Legislature? But if
                                this provision bs special, it would make the whole law special and
                                local, and therefore void. Bat he thought his amendment would
                                obviate that objection. The committee had heard lawyers of great
                                skill and eminence, and they were sustained by the opinions of these
                                men. He lived on the line of the Wabash and Erie Canal, and of
                                course would not do anything to prejudice that interest. The bill
                                could not by any possibility affect that canal.
                            Mr. HUMPHREYS opposed the bill-not the desire of the Whitewater
                                people for a railroad. But the White River valley also wanted a
                                railroad. And he looked to the possibility of procuring the right of
                                way to the bed of the Wabash and Erie Canal, from Greene county
                                southward. That canal had now gone do in that portion of it. He was
                                opposed to bill unless it would include a provision to admit of a
                                railroad in that direction.
                            Mr. WRIGHT said the Junction Road might use the canal for feeding
                                their road. That canal-the first mortgaged liens-was sold at public
                                outcry, and some $200,000 worth of claims were bought for a mere
                                nominal sum. The Ohio Legislature had authorized the of that part of
                                the canal in their State without protecting the creditors. These
                                creditors were  not here with
                                any remonstrance. Almost all the people along the line were for this
                                bill. The Indianapolis & Lawrenceburg Railroad holds the outlet
                                from that valley to Cincinnati. This road, when built, would double
                                the value of the property of that valley. They could not get a
                                railroad without this bill. Then why throw away the possibility of
                                this road? Here in this amendment we undertake to say how they shall
                                dispose of their property. Was it not better to allow all men to
                                dispose of their property in their own way? But the gentleman has
                                more sympathy for these creditors than for his own people--more than
                                the creditors have for themselves--except the Junction road, and
                                they paid but three cents on the dollar for the $20,000 they hold.
                                The question was simply this: Are we legislating for the people of
                                Indiana, or for these creditors living in the State of Ohio? Under
                                this state of facts, should we so clog the bill, that these people
                                can never have a railroad, and continue the enormous freight charged
                                by the Junction road?
                            Mr. COLLINS had been apprehensive that the bill would sell the Wabash
                                and Erie Canal. That Canal in the hands of the Wabash Valley
                                Railroad would injure his people. The reasoning of gentlemen were
                                plausible, but not yet satisfactory to him.
                             Mr. FERRIS was surprised at the opposition to the bill. This canal
                                had always been worthless. The main source of opposition was that
                                its provisions-would include the Wabash and Erie Canal; but this was
                                effectually destroyed by the amendment of the gentleman from
                                Huntington. Nine-tenths of the people themselves along the
                                Whitewater Canal were in favor of this bill.
                            Mr. GREGG moved to lay the minority report on the table.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Certainly that was very courteous in the
                                gentleman, after an hour's debate on his side.
                            Mr. GREGG then withdrew the motion.
                            Mr. SIM had signed the minority report, and said it was not necessary
                                for him to reply at length to the range of debate which had been
                                taken. His object was to guard the rights and interests of the canal
                                stockholders. The bill attached no forfeiture to the neglect or
                                destruction of the water-power. We should legislate for the rights
                                and interests of the people and these stockholders and creditors.
                                They had remonstrated. We wanted they should have their rights, and
                                they would get a part of them if we pass the amendment, with an
                                amendment which he would propose.
                            Mr. Claypool had represented these interests here. He thought an
                                amendment should be attached prescribing a forfeiture, if they
                                infringed upon the hydraulic power. He proposed to amend the
                                amendment by adding: Provided that the proceeds of the sale for the
                                benefit of the mortgage liens on said canal shall be paid pro rata
                                in the order of their priority.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to strike out the words "pro
                                    rata."
                            Mr. SIM accepted the modification.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK was in favor of Mr. Sim's amendment. He took this view.
                                The State transferred the canal to a company in1842, reserving the
                                right of redemption. In 1849 it was provided that the right of
                                redemption should be forfeited in fifty years. This matter was now
                                some how in the Court, Mr. Lord holding a prior lien. It would be in
                                violation of law to divide it pro rata among all
                                the creditors. There were others subsequent. The effect of passing
                                the bill in the shape now recommended by the majority will not give
                                these creditors anything till Mr. Lord is paid. He did not know
                                whether these creditors were here or not; however this might be, it
                                did not change our obligation to do justice.
                            If the canal is worthless, then those owning subsequent liens will
                                not bathe purchasers, but they will allow Mr. Lord to purchase it at
                                almost any price. He illustrated the law and equity of the case. We
                                should not purue a line of policy that would not be adopted in a
                                court of justice. The canal should be sold so as to secure the
                                rights of these creditors. He was in favor of advancing the
                                interests of that locality-they ought to have this railroad. Whilst
                                he was opposed to all monopolies, he would protect the vested rights
                                of Mr. Lord as proposed to be secured by Mr. Sims' amendment.
                            Mr. LOCKHART desired to offer an amendment to the minority
                                report.
                            The SPEAKER said it would not be in order.
                            Mr. COFFROTH'S amendment was now read.
                             Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, wished to offer an amendment to the third
                                line of the bill, inserting these words: "By the consent of the
                                Whitewater Valley Canal Company." 
                            The SPEAKER. The power of amendment is now exhausted-the amendment of
                                the gentleman from Huntington, (Mr. Coffroth,) being an amendment to
                                an amendment.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB showed that the exception of the Wabash and Erie Canal
                                did not make the bill local. It was not the intention of the
                                Constitution to exclude local legislation, and he would prefer the
                                bill in such shape as directly to authorize the railroad on the
                                White-water Valley Canal. He read the Constitution and court
                                decisions bearing on the case-the Court recognizing but two canals
                                in the State.
                            [Here Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe had leave of absence-he had just
                                received a dispatch that one of his children was very sick.]
                            Mr. BRANHAM rose to move the previous question.
                            Mr. COFFROTH spoke to Mr. Sim's amendment. It would destroy the
                                effect of the bill. The bill and the amendment were in direct
                                antagonism. He showed, further, that there might be exceptions to a
                                general law, because exceptions prove the rule. Would not men
                                protect themselves at private as well as public sales? He gave
                                examples. If he sold his land with a mortgage on it, the buyer
                                bought it subject to the lien. So with this proposition.
                            His amendment originated with a gentleman whom he regarded as a good
                                lawyer. If there was any possible constitutional objection this
                                ought to remove it. It simply excepts any canal in the hands of
                                trustees, and the Wabash & Erie canal is in the hands of
                                trustees.
                            
                            Mr. LOCKHART. It had been intimated that this Junction road was
                                simply a switch. Its original design was to extend from this city to
                                Cincinnati, and it was now running seventy miles. By our legislation
                                we would give other parties an advantage over this road in the
                                purchase.
                            Mr. BRANHAM demanded the previous question, and there was a second;
                                and under its force Mr. Sims' amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, demanded the yeas and nays on the
                                amendment reported to the minority of the committee, (Mr. Wright's,)
                                and they were ordered, and being taken, the result was--yeas 15,
                                nays 60--as follows: 
                            
                            
                                
                                    

                                        YEAS--Messrs. Banta, Gregory, of Warren, Groves, Hershey,
                                            Hoover, Lockhart, Miller of Tippecanoe, McVey, Newcomb,
                                            Riford, Sabin, Sim, Steward, Trusler, Woodruff, and
                                            Zeigler--15.
                                        NAYS--Messrs. Atkinson, Bird, Bonner, Boyd, Branham,
                                            Burnes, Burwell, Church, Coffroth, Collies, Cook, Cox,
                                            Crook, Emerson, Ferris, Goodman, Gregg, Griffith.
                                            Hamrick, Hargrove, Harrison, Higgins, Hogate, Howard,
                                            Humphreys, Hunt, Kilgore, Lane, Lemon, Meredith, Miller,
                                            of Clinton, Montgomery, O'Brien, Osborn, Patterson,

                                            White, Whiteside, Willis, Woods, Wright, and Mr.
                                            Speaker--60.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the minority amendment was rejected, and the question recurred on
                                the first amendment of the majority; but-
                            Mr. Coffroth's amendment to the bill was first informally agreed
                                to.
                            The first amendment of the majority of the committee guarding the
                                State from responsibility for the canal debt, and securing the
                                hydraulic power, was agreed to.
                            The second amendment of the majority, providing that in case of
                                failure of the canal company to preserve the hydraulic power, the
                                lessees or others may organize a company for its protection, was
                                also agreed to.
                            Mr. HIGGINS moved for unanimous consent to insert in the fourth line
                                after the word "authorized," the words "or to suffer."
                            It was agreed to.
                            
                            And so the bill was ordered to the third reading, read the third time
                                and passed the House of Representatives-yeas 66, nays 12.
                            Mr. COFFROTH proposed to add to the title these words:
                            
                                And for the protection of the hydraulic power
                                    of such canal to authorize the lessees to form a company for the
                                    maintainance thereof, in case of failure of the canal company to
                                    maintain the same."
                            
                            So the bill passed. 
                            Mr. RHOADS (by unanimous consent) moved that the bill reported by the
                                    Committee on Education last Friday be taken
                                from the Speaker's table, and that the constitutional restriction be
                                suspended so that it may be read the first time by title.
                            
                            
                            The restriction was suspended--yeas 70, nays 0--and the
                                    Education Committee's bill [H. R. No. 178] for an act to
                                provide for a general system of common schools, the officers
                                thereof, and their respective powers and duties and matters properly
                                connected therewith, and for the establishment of township
                                libraries, and to repeal all laws inconsistent therewith:
                            Which was passed to the second reading, and made the special order
                                for Wednesday, 10 ' o'clock.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT TILL MONDAY.
                            Mr. HIGGINS, (to give committees a chance to do business,) moved that
                                when the House adjourns to-day, it shall be till Monday, 2 o'clock
                                P. M.
                            
                            The motion was agreed to--affirmative 43, negative 27.
                        
                        
                            TELL CITY RAILROAD.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, Mr. Groves's City Railroad bill, No. 89, [see p. 119] was
                                taken up and considered on the third reading, and read the third
                                time by the clerk.
                            Mr. GROVES explained its provisions and necessity.
                            
                            The bill was then passed the final reading in the House of
                                Representatives--yeas 70, nays 0.
                            On motion of Mr. REESE, Mr. James had leave of absence on account ot
                                sickness.

                            On motion of Mr. CHURCH, the County Bonds bill (S. No. 3) was made the
                                special order for Tuesday at 2 o'clock P. M.
                            And then--at 5 15 P. M.--on motion of Mr. BURNES, the House adjourned
                                till Monday at 2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         SATURDAY. February 18, 1865.
                    
                    The LIEUT. GOVERNOR called to order at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    The secretary's journal of yesterday was read and approved.
                    
                        SOLDIERS' RELIEF.
                        On motion by Mr. CHAPMAN, the bill H. R.
                                14, (see pages 142, 143, 144 and 145 of the BREVIER
                            LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) was read the second time.
                        Mr. OYLER gave reasons sufficient in his own mind to demand immediate
                            action by the Senate on this bill.
                        Mr. VAWTER had been besought by many of his constituents to oppose this
                            bill, but he was not prepared to say that he would oppose any bill for
                            the relief of soldiers in the field, soldiers in the hospitals, or
                            soldiers' families.
                        Mr. CORBIN was not sufficiently advised to say whether he should vote for
                            or against the bill, and in order to inform himself and others of its
                            merits, he moved that the bill be laid on the table, and two hundred
                            copies thereof printed.
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 20, nays 16.
                    
                    
                        RAILROADS.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. HANNA, the bill S.
                                30, (see page 44 of the BREVIER REPORTS) was read the second
                            time, and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                    
                    
                        FIRST READING OF HOUSE BILLS.
                        House bills numbered 8, (see page

                            page 170 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) was referred to a select committee of
                            three.

                            (page 85,) 12, (page 96) and 14, (page 131,) were read the second time
                            and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                    
                    
                        JOINT COMMITTEE ON CORPORATIONS.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR makes the committee on the part of the Senate,
                            authorized by a concurrent resolution, providing for the appointment of
                            a joint committee on corporations, to consist of
                            Messrs. Ward, Hanna, and Peden.
                    
                    
                        SESSION HOURS.
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns

                        ABSENCE.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT it was 
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That leaves of absence shall be
                                        granted to Senators, only upon sufficient cause, to be
                                        stated in writing, and by a vote of two-thirds of the
                                        Senators present.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time, and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        Mr. ENGLISH, [S. 171] to reimburse Samuel H. Patterson, late lessee of
                            the Indiana Slate Prison, for the money expended by him on account of
                            work and labor rendered by sundry convicts during said Patterson's lease
                            of said prison. [Appropriating to Patterson the sum of $2,091 34, and
                            $300 for attorneys fees.]
                        By Mr. CORBIN, [S. 172,] supplemental to an act for the incorporation of
                            towns, &c., approved June 11, 1852, providing therein for the levy
                            and collection of taxes for certain purposes therein specified upon the
                            real and personal property of railroads, including roadbeds,
                            plank-roads, telegraph and bridge companies, and banks lying in the
                            corporate limits of any incorporated towns within this State. 
                    
                    
                        LEAVES OF ABSENCE
                        Were obtained for Mr. Oyler on account of sickness, and for Mr.
                            Allison.
                    
                    
                        SOLDIERS' RELIEF.
                        On motion by Mr. CHAPMAN the vote ordering the printing of the bill H. R. 14, was reconsidered. 
                    
                    
                        AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
                            STATES.
                        
                        The following remarks were submitted on the joint resolution [S. 16] accepting and ratifying
                            certain amendments to the Constitution of the United Scales, proposed by
                            Congress to the Legislatures of the several States, under orders of the
                            Senate adopted on the 10th and 18th of February.
                        Mr. TERRY. It was not my purpose when this measure first came before the
                            Senate, to take any part in the discussion. The desire to say anything
                            upon it is due to what has subsequently transpired. Indeed, to be
                            entirely frank, I must attribute my present intention to speak upon it
                            entirely to such arguments as have been urged by Democratic Senators.
                            But for them I was willing and even anxious to let it pass, and go to
                            the country and the world upon its own merits; for I did not doubt that
                            it would be able to make its own way with the present and future
                            generations of mankind. Nor has my faith in the self-sufficing force of
                            the measure been at all shaken by the assaults of its adversaries upon
                            this floor. It is not upon that ground that my original intention to
                            preserve silence has been changed. It is due rather to my own relation
                            to the measure that I now propose briefly to review some of the
                            arguments of its opponents.
                        A desire to stand fairly before my constituents, and to prevent the faith
                            of any of them in regard to the expediency and rectitude of this great
                            act of universal emancipation, from being impaired or shaken by the fact
                            that its friends failed fairly to meet and fully to answer every
                            objection, prompts me at this time to address the Senate. All the
                            arguments I have heard from the other side may, without injustice to
                            their authors, be reduced to three classes:
                        
                            1st. It is asserted that we have not the power to abolish
                                slavery by amending the constitution of the United States.
                            2d If the power-exists it would not be just to exercise
                                it.
                            3d. If both the power and justice of the measure be
                                admitted, it still would not be expedient to do it.
                        
                        Every argument that has been urged, every argument, indeed, that can be
                            urged against the joint resolution now before us may be ranged, nay,
                            must be ranged under some one of these heads.
                        Allow me, then, briefly to examine the first of these propositions, for I
                            shall confine my remarks to it alone.
                        It is asserted that we have not the power to abolish slavery by amending
                            the Constitution of the United States. That the views of our opponents
                            may be beaten with the utmost fairness and candor, I beg leave to state
                            them in the precise words in which they have uttered them. The Senator
                            from Vigo [Mr. Hanna] speaking upon this branch of the subject said:
                        "I am totally unable, sir, to find any power delegated by the States, in
                            the Constitution, empowering two-thirds of Congress, and three-fourths
                            of the Legislatures of the States, to so amend the Constitution as to
                            deprive the States of their expressly reserved rights to manage their
                            own domestic affairs, agreeably to their own wishes.
                        "Again. If two-thirds of Congress, Mr. President, and three-fourths of
                            the legislatures, of States, can prohibit negro servitude in the States,
                            may they not likewise compel a State against its will to institute the
                            relation of master and servant within its confines?--a monstrous
                            assumption, to which I will not subscribe
                        
                        "I believe further, sir, that the same power which can destroy any one of
                            the domestic institutions of a State, may destroy them all, and thus
                            annihilate State sovereignty."
                        Making all due allowance for the confusion of ideas apparent in these
                            extracts from the Senators speech--a confusion for which he is less
                            responsible than his party--I beg leave to consider the fallacies which
                            they convey in regard to the subject now under discussion. He manifestly
                            clings to the dogma of State rights and State sovereignty as rising
                            above, and being superior to the rights and sovereignty of the General
                            Government. Hence, he is "unable to find any power delegated by the
                            States, in the Constitution, empowering" Congress and the States to pass
                            this amendment. I do not wonder at his inability-his total inability to
                            find any such delegation of power from the States, They only delegated
                            powers in an instrument. Who are the authors? The States of this Union
                            are not the anthers of the Constitution; they do not speak through it;
                            they do not delegate any single power contained in it; nor reserve to
                            themselves any single light or power therein reserved to the States or
                            the people. As authors, they are wholly unknown to the Constitution;
                            while it is true, that they are the subjects of many of its provisions.
                            The Constitution is the work of the people of the United States, and not
                            of the States; and whatever power they have therein conferred upon the
                            Government of the United States belongs to that Government, and stands
                            high above the reach of the several States. The language of the
                            Constitution itself is too clear for doubt-much too clear for earnest
                            controversy among honest men. "We, the people of the United States, do
                            ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
                            America." There is nothing equivocal in this language It is too plain to
                            admit of doubt. The people, therefore, and not the States, created the
                            Federal Government. They delegated all the powers it has, and imposed
                            all the limitations upon them that exist. But we are not left to the
                            plain words of the Constitution on this paint; the language of its
                            friends and its enemies, pending the question of its adoption before the
                            American people, are fall and clear to the same effect. Patrick Henry,
                            the leading opponent of the Constitution in the Virginia Convention, is
                            reported to have said:
                        
                            What right, had they to say "we, the people,"
                                instead of "we, the States"? My political curiosity, exclusive of my
                                solicitude for the public welfare, leads me to ask who authorized
                                them to speak the language of ''we, the people," instead of "we, the
                                States"?3 Eliott's Debates, p. 22.
                        
                        In reply, Gov. Randolph said:
                        "The gentlemen then proceeds and inquires why we assume the language of
                            'We, the People." I ask why not? .The Government is for the people, and
                            the misfortune was, that the people had no agency in the Government
                            before. What harm is there in consulting the people on the Constitution
                            of a Government by which they are to be bound? Is it unjust? If the
                            Government is to be binding on the people, are not the people the proper
                            persons to examine its merits and defects?" Ib. pp. 28, 29.
                        These examples might be numerously multiplied of objections to the
                            Constitution, because it was the work of the people, and not of the
                            States. For those who may be curious to examine the circumstances under
                            which the Convection was lead to adopt the language of "We, the People,"
                            and its importance in construing the provisions of the Constitution, I
                            beg leave to refer to 2 Curtis History of the Constitution, pp. 372,
                            373. That the learned author of that truly valuable work is now regarded
                            with the opponents of emancipation, enhances rather than diminishes its
                            authority upon the paint in controversy.
                        The same opinions were held by all early commentators upon the
                            Constitution; among them I may name Story, Kent, Marshall, and Webster.
                            All these concur in regarding the people, and not the States, as the
                            power that ordained the Constitution. On the other hand none but the
                            malcontents of the country, the aristocrats of the South, and their
                            parasites of the North, to whom power has ever been dearer than the
                            liberty and glory of their country, and who, in the pursuit thereof,
                            have at last arrayed themselves in bloody treason and rebellion against
                            their Government, have at any time held that the Constitution was
                            ordained and established by the States. Even the Democratic party
                            utterly rejected that wicked fallacy as late as 1848, In the National
                            Convention of that year it could muster but few votes, and was not
                            destined to become successful until the slave-holding interest of the
                            South became more powerful, for the control of the Democracy, than the
                            principles of the Constitution and the general welfare of the whole
                            country. Since then that party has used it as both shield and sword--as
                            sword to stab the national life, and as shield to protect their own
                            treason.
                        If, therefore, the States as such, are not the founders and establishes
                            of the General Government, the Senator may well say that he is "totally
                            unable to find any power delegated by the States, in the Constitution,"
                            empowering, two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the States to
                            pass this amendment.
                        I am like him in that respect, and do not find fault with him for the
                            simple utterance of what from the origin of the Government must be true
                            of necessity. The objection I have to the Senator's assertion is not due
                            to the truth stated, but to the error implied in the statement. His true
                            assertion carries a falsehood in its belly; for, in saying that the
                            States have not delegated the power in question, which is true beyond
                            all doubt, he conveys the idea that the States have delegated all the
                            powers the General Government possesses, which is false beyond all
                            question.
                        The people of the United States speak thus upon this subject:
                        "The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it
                            necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the
                            application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States
                            shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case,
                            shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution,
                            when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several
                            States, or by Conventions of three-fourths thereof, as the one or the
                            other mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress."
                        Every State that has come into the Union have placed its institutions
                            subject to this power  of
                            amendment. They have agreed to take the risk, and abide by the
                            changes.
                        The change from freedom to slavery, or slavery to freedom, does not
                            present a question of power at all. It is one of justice and expediency
                            alone, for "whenever two-thirds of both houses of Congress shall deem it
                            necessary, Congress shall propose amendments to the Constitution,"
                            which, when ratified as aforesaid, "shall be valid to all intents and
                            purposes, as part of this Constitution, and" it is added, "that the
                            members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and
                            judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several States,
                            shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution."
                        Now, is anything more clear than the obligation of honorable Senators to
                            support the Constitution when thus amended. Senators will not contend
                            that the laws of a State can protect slavery against the operation of a
                            free Constitution of the United States, to support which all the
                            officers of the State are solemnly sworn.
                        But this general power of amendment would his the amending powers to
                            ''compel a State against its will to institute the election of master
                            and servant within its confines-a monstrous assumption to which the
                            Senator will not subscribe." But why not? Every people in whose
                            government there exists a power of amendment, runs the risk of having
                            their institutions worsted as well as improved by every change. Our
                            fathers did not shrink from this venture; for they knew that errors may
                            be tolerated while truth is left free to combat it.- The triumphant
                            passage of this resolution will forever vindicate their wisdom. But why
                            should Democrats, and especially Buchanan, Lecompton, Breckenridge
                            Democrats, now shrink from subscribing to the proposition that
                            two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and the Legislatures of
                            three-fourths of the States may compel a State to institute the relation
                            of slavery against its will, as "a monstrous assumption?" Have they not
                            gone that far already? Witness their greedy support of the Lecompton
                            Constitution, a measure that had that for its purpose, design and end.
                            They know it was not approved by the people of Kansas; that it was
                            opposed to their principles; that it was the work of outside influence,
                            force, fraud and villany, and yet they stood by it to the last, although
                            it was indeed "a monstrous assumption" in the form in which it was then
                            proposed. And what did they do when they were finally defeated; or, at
                            least, when defeat became inevitable. Why, sir, they proposed the
                            English Bill-a measure even still more infamous than the direct, open
                            and manly support of the naked Lecompton Constitution; for they
                            endeavored thereby to bribe the people of Kansas by favorable terms and
                            immediate admission into the Union with slavery, while they shut the
                            door of admission against them for years in case of their refusal. But
                            they were contending then for the extension of slavery, and the power in
                            question was, in their opinion holy, just and good," because it served
                            their purpose. Now, however, when the right to exercise a plain
                            constitutional power in favor of universal freedom is asserted; they
                            start back aghast; and in self-contradiction deny that we can do by
                            amendments, what they labored for years to accomplish without, It is
                            their love of slavery, and their hatred of freedom that controls their
                            utterances. I thank God that truth, and justice, are always uniform, and
                            consistent in the pursuit of their ends, while error, falsehood, and
                            injustice are ever changeable, fickle, and self-contradicting.
                        I might carry this argument against that wing of the Democracy still
                            further, by showing how react they were to accede to the monstrous
                            doctrines of the Dred Scott decisions-doctrines that when carried to
                            their logical results, establish slavery in every State of the Union,
                            under the sanction and shield of the Constitution; and do it all, too,
                            by a judicial construction in flat contradiction of its own provisions
                            and purposes; and of the known opinions of all those who participated in
                            planning and adopting it. But we must not look to the last friends of a
                            dying institution-an institution which at best was "the sum of all
                            villainies"-now when it is about to be buried, without the promise or
                            hope of resurrection for consistency. If we do we shall be sadly
                            disappointed. To-day, as ever before--
                        Error wounded Writhes in pain and dies amid his worshippers.
                        I will not quarrel with his contortions, or with such of his friends as
                            sympathize so strongly with his dying agonies as to give back grimace
                            for grimace, and agony for agony. The Democratic party lived on slavery
                            while it lived; and it is but natural for those who still "watch its
                            slowly dying fires," to feel that it must perish, too, where slavery is
                            gone. And it will. Both will go to the grave together; and "silent in a
                            last embrace," will sleep the sleep that knows no waking. They were
                            hateful in their lives, and in their death they shall not be divided. A
                            regenerated humanity shall build the sacred temple of universal liberty
                            upon their tomb; and the fires upon its altar, watched and fed by a
                            free, united and happy people, shall be extinguished no more forever.
                            All the ends of the earth shall flow into it; and with united and
                            grateful voices make glad the universe with their songs of deliverance
                            and freedom.
                        Mr. BONHAM. Mr. President: But for the disposition on the part of other
                            Senators in this chamber to discuss this question, I should have
                            remained silent. I preferred to submit this question, momentous as it
                            is, without debate, as much of the time might probably have been spent
                            more profitably than in the discussion of a question upon which the mind
                            of every Senator was well settled before he came here. But, as Senators
                            will bear me witness, that I have at no time since the commencement of
                            this session demanded their attention upon any question, I hope I will
                            have a patient hearing while I attempt to submit a few remarks as a
                            basis upon which I predicate my vote on this resolution.
                         Mr. President, I conclude that this is a question, of paramount
                            interest, not to the people of Indiana alone, but to the entire people
                            of these United States. Shall that foul stain which has blotted our fair
                            escutcheon for more than a century be wiped out of existence ? Shall
                            that  element of discord and
                            disaffection which has drenched our country with blood, which has
                            rendered thousands cf hearth-stones desolate and caused the moans of
                            thousands of widows and orphans to ascend, be removed ? Shall that
                            institution which was .conceived in sin and brought forth in inequity,
                            founded upon princtples of injustice, tyranny and oppression, be
                            abolished? For ail these questions I hear Senators, on the other side of
                            the Chamber, answer, most emphatically, "no."
                        The right to so amend the Constitution of our country as to forever
                            prohibit this accursed institution of slavery, I believe, sir, has not
                            been successfully denied by those whose business it seems to be hero to
                            vindicate the right to enslave their fellow-men. However much the
                            propriety of the measure may be questioned, however much Senators may
                            conjure up some imaginary evil which might result from this act, in my
                            opinion there can no longer exist question as to the expediency and the
                            justice of the adoption of the resolution.
                        It can scarcely be denied, with any degree of plausibility, that but for
                            this discordant element, to-day peace, harmony and prosperity would
                            pervade our entire country. Slavery engendered and fostered the proud
                            factious and rebellious spirit which produced, and has ever since
                            supported the present wicked and causeless rebellion. Why perpetuate an
                            institution which all must concede is an element of great strength to
                            those who are attempting, by the most cruel and relentless mode of
                            warfare ever witnessed by civilized nations, to destroy the best
                            Government ever founded by the wisdom of man? Why perpetuate an
                            institution which the rebels themselves admit is the corner stone of
                            their bogus confederacy, and which, if removed, must prove their eternal
                            overthrow? Why perpetuate an institution, the discussion and criticism
                            of which has subjected hundreds of our best citizens to mob violence,
                            imprisonment, and even death? To these questions I very respectfully
                            invite the attention of Senators upon the other side of this
                            chamber.
                        I desire to view this subject for one moment in its legal aspect. I am
                            aware, sir, that it is claimed by the advocates of this detestable
                            institution, that it has a legal existence by State law, and hence can
                            not bs disturbed; and the question was very defiantly propounded here by
                            the Senator from Bartholomew [Mr. Hord], "whether Congress had the right
                            to establish slavery in any State against the wish of her people." I
                            answer him no. In the first place, Congress does not propose directly to
                            prohibit slavery in any State; it is simply done by the people, in whom
                            all political power resides. Further, sir, I deny the right of any
                            legislative body to enact a law by which any human being maybe enslaved,
                            from the fact, it most be admitted by all, that slavery is morally,
                            politically and socially wrong, and therefore violates the foundation of
                            all law which is justice. Municipal law is defined to be a rule of civil
                            conduct, prescribed by the supreme power of a State commanding what is
                            right, and prohibiting what is wrong. Hence, sir, I submit that, from
                            this definition, a law which does not command that which is right, and
                            prohibit that which is wrong is void, notwithstanding it may have
                            received the forms of a legislative body. There being no Senator in this
                            chamber who dare risk his reputation in the attempt to prove that
                            slavery is right, then, sir, I insist that no law can be enacted giving
                            it protection for one moment.
                        The natural condition of every man, whether black, white, red or yellow,
                            is that of freedom, and in this assertion I am not without good
                            authority, and I propose to quote it.
                        The celebrated Dr. Johnson says:
                        
                            "No man is by nature the property of
                                another."
                        
                        Lord Coke says:
                        
                            "Whatever a legislative body enacts, shall be
                                taken for naught if it is contrary to human nature."
                        
                        Blackstone, whose writings I presume many Senators here are familiar
                            with, says:
                        
                            "If neither captivity nor contract can, by the
                                plain law of nature, reduce the parent to a state of slavery, much
                                less can they reduce their offspring."
                        
                        He further says:
                        
                            "The law of nature being coeval with mankind, and
                                dictated by God himself; is of course superior to all others."
                        
                        Having thus establishd the fact that no law can be enacted, except it be
                            established upon principles of justice and right, and not in conflict
                            with the law of nature, I regard it as a sufficient reply to the
                            question as to whether Congress can or can not establish slavery in the
                            States.
                        There is another branch of this question to which I desire to call the
                            attention of Senators briefly. It may be very truly remarked that the
                            institution of slavery bears less heavily upon the thousands ot
                            non--slaveholding whites in those States where its exists than the
                            slaves themselves. It is true, in national as it is in individual
                            abstracts, that loss and injury to one party may constitute a fair
                            consideration as gain to the other. Sir, does the slaveholder, while he
                            is enjoying his slaves, reflect for one moment the deep and incalculable
                            injury which the possession of that property inflicts upon his neighbor?
                            It deprives the poor laboring whites of almost all the mental and
                            material comforts of life. Do Senators on the other side assume that
                            four millions of Africans should be held in bondage to the detriment of
                            six millions of honest laboring white men? It may be said it banishes
                            free labor from a country; it exterminates the mechanic, the artizan and
                            the manufacturer; it converts the energy of a community into indolence;
                            its powers into imbecility; its efficiency into weakness. I insist that
                            a few thousand slaveholders have no right to grow rich, if by so doing
                            they entail upon four millions of negroes and six millions of white men
                            poverty misery and woe. 
                        Where are those Senators who so much desire to legislate for the white
                            man? Sir, they have voted to fasten slavery not only upon four million
                            of negroes, but six million of white men. The institution being thus
                            injurious to all those who are so unfortunate as to come in contact with
                            it, I do insist that we have a right to demand its extermination. Sir,
                            must this glorious Government of ours be rent in twain, that the
                            slaveholder may continue to gather his crop of human flesh, from the
                            labor of their dark hands and the fruit of their loins?  These mongers in human flesh, have become
                            wealthy, insolent, corrupt, tyranical and disloyal.
                         Then, sir, I respectfully submit, that justice demands, humanity
                            demands; yea Christianity and the future safety and perpetuity of our
                            glorious Republic, demands that this day the shackles should fall from
                            the limbs of every human being. When that is done, and not until then,
                            will we as a Nation be free, happy and prosperous.
                        When this great and benevolent purpose is finally consummated, then will
                            a million of stout-hearted Africans flee from the yoke of bondage, and
                            rush to the rescue of that glorious old flag under whose floating folds
                            they, for the first time, can seek protection. Then will we be enabled
                            to see from all parts of the snow capped mountains of the North, the
                            funny fields of the South, and the wide extended prairies of the West,
                            men of every color, with brave hearts and strong hands, flocking around
                            one common standard, and battling in defense of the Constitution and the
                            Union, fighting for their own homes and firesides, and rallying to the
                            old battle cry of our revolutionary fathers--one destiny, one country,
                            independence now and independence forever. 
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                
                
                
                
                    IN SENATE

                    
                        MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1865.
                    
                    The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called to order at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    On motion of Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of the Secretary's minutes of
                        Saturday's proceedings was dispensed with.
                    
                        PETITIONSM
                        Were presented by Messrs. VAWTER and OYLER, praying that liquor sellers
                            shall be required to procure the consent of a majority of voters in the
                            town before license shall be granted, which were referred to the
                                Committee on Temperance without reading.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of the bill, S. 156, (see
                            page 193 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) and that the bill S. 18, (page 37,) be
                            laid on the table--a similar bill having been ordered engrossed by the
                            Senate.
                    
                    
                        HOUSE BILLS ON THE FIRST READING
                        The bills H. R. 89, (see page 119)
                            and 59 (page 83.) were read the first time and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        WORK FOR COMMITTEES.
                        House bills numbered 8, (see page
                            41 of the BREVIER REPORTS (10, (page 75) 122, (page 158) and 160, (page 217) and Senate bills
                            171 and 172, (introduced yesterday,) were read by title only and
                            referred to appropriate committees.
                        The bill, H. R. 158 (p. 190,) was read the second time and referred to
                            the Special Committee on Railroad appraisements.
                    
                    
                        ORDERED ENGROSSED.
                        The bill H. R. 15, (on page 57 of
                            the Reports erroneously numbered 16,) after being amended, and the bill
                            S. 47 (page 54,) were read the second time and passed to the third
                            reading. 
                    
                    
                        BILLS PASSED.
                        
                        The following bills were read the third time, and finally passed the
                            Senate except in the cases stated:
                        
                        Senate bill No. 5 (see p. 17,) incorporating in section 601 of the
                            practice act the words "upon filing an affidavit setting forth facts
                            showing that he had a meritorious cause of action or defense," and
                            adding thereto these words: "The court shall grant but one new trial,
                            unless for good cause shown, as in other cases," was passed by yeas 33,
                            nays 3.
                        
                        Senate bill No. 20 (see p. 38,)
                            failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority--yeas 23, nays
                            14.
                        Senate bill No. 30, (see p. 44 of
                            these Reports) was partially read and laid on the table.
                        
                        Subsequently, on motion of Mr. DUNNING, it was taken up, the reading
                            thereof finished, and was passed by yeas 29, nays 10.
                        
                        Senate bill No. 31, (described on p. 44 of the Reports,) was passed by
                            yeas 36, nays 1.
                        
                        Senate bill No. 34, (see p. 44.) was amended by striking out all limiting
                            its provisions to cities incorporated under the general laws of this
                            State, and passed by yeas 37, nays 0.
                        
                        Senate bill No. 50, (see page 60 of these Reports,) being nearly an exact
                            copy of the Illinois statute upon that subject, was passed by yeas 32,
                            nays 3.
                        Senate bill No. 53, (see page 60,)
                            was partially read and laid on the table.
                        
                        Subsequently, on motion of Mr. CULVER, it was taken up, the reading
                            thereof finished, and it was passed by yeas 37, nays 2.
                        Senate bill No. 88 (described on
                            page 109 of the BREVIER REPORTS) failed to pass for want of a
                            Constitutional majority--yeas 24, nays 13.
                        
                        Subsequently, on motion by Mr. BENNETT, the bill was taken up and passed,
                            by yeas 27, nays 12.
                        Senate bill No. 91, amending section 108 of the Practice Act was
                            read.
                        Mr. HORD insisted that the bill took an unfair advantage of the criminal,
                            because it provides that the prosecuting attorney shall have the opening
                            and closing of the argument. In some parts of the State the Judges act
                            as Prosecuting Attornies in giving their charge to the jury, thus giving
                            two chances against the criminal to his one. He was satisfied with the
                            law as it is.
                        Mr. NILES was of the opinion that the change proposed by this bill would
                            bs benefical.
                        Mr. OYLER concluded that any judge speaking for or against the prisoner
                            at the bar, stains the ermine. He thought the change indicated by the
                            bill was necessary.
                        Mr. DUNNING. It is the presumption of law that every man is innocent till
                            the contrary is proven. This law was oppressive on the accused. He
                            favored the plan of giving the attorney of the accused the closing of
                            the argument. Old prosecuting attorneys when they get on the bench, will
                            almost always make their charge to the jury an argument against the
                            accused, if not in words the manner tends to a deleterious influence on
                            the cause of the accused. He opposed the bill.
                        Mr. BONHAM. The law, as it now stands, is, as I believe, a lawyer's act,
                            for the benefit of those who make criminal defense their exclusive
                            profession. The proposed change is seeking no advantage of those who are
                            charged  with the commission of
                            crime. It is a rule in all discussions that the party upon whom rests
                            the burden of the issue has a right to commence and conclude the
                            argument. This being the fact, I ask why this should be an exception to
                            the general rule, when investigating the conduct of those who are
                            charged with violating the laws of the State? At the present low salary
                            of Prosecuting Attorneys, I regard the man truly unfortunate who aspires
                            to the position, and it is a notorious fact, also, that the ablest
                            lawyers do not prosecute, therefore the prosecutor ought to be placed on
                            an equal footing with the able attorney who is engaged for the
                            defendant.
                        In this day, when crime stalks broadcast all over this country, it has
                            become next to impossible to convict of any crime. Sir, while we are
                            guarding the interests of those who violate the law, I think it is
                            eminently proper to guard the interests of the people of our noble
                            State.
                        Mr. MASON opposed the bill.
                        Mr. DOWNEY two years ago advocated a measure of this kind and he favored
                            it now. The object is to restore the practice which obtained in criminal
                            cases prior to 1852. The State labors under inconveniences enough in
                            such cases without giving the present undue advantages to the criminal.
                            The charge of the judge must necessarily partake somewhat of an answer
                            to the argument last made to the jury--especially if something be
                            improperly said, in the speech of counsel for the defense. If it is
                            desired that the judges charge should not be an argument in favor cf the
                            State, let us return to the rule as it was before the enactment of the
                            present law, then there will be no danger of the judge making an
                            argument against the accused.
                        If you allow the Prosecuting Attorney to close the case, there would be
                            no danger of the Judge prejudicing the minds of the jury against the
                            accused, whether he be an old prosecutor or not.
                        Mr. COBB. This bill was investigated by the Judiciary Committee, and they
                            did not agree unadimously upon recommending its passage. There were four
                            members present; two voted for it, one against it, and one remained
                            silent. He believed the passage of the bill would work an evil. He never
                            knew any evil growing out of the present practice. If this bill should
                            pass he would immediately introduce a bill providing that defendants
                            shall be permitted to testify. Were this bill to pass you would see
                            innocent men suffer because the prosecuting attorneys would have an
                            undue advantage.
                        And then the bill was rejected by yeas 13, nays 26.
                        

                        Senate bill No. 92 (see page 109,)
                            extending the privileges of city railroads outside of corporation
                            limits, was passed by a vote of yeas 32, nays 2.

                        Senate bill 52, (see page 60,) was passed by yeas 33 nays 4.
                    
                    
                        ABSENCE.
                        Mr. OYLER obtained leave of absence till Thursday next.
                        Mr. COBB moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday, adopting the
                            resolution (Mr. Bennett's) concerning leaves of absence.
                        
                        Mr. BENNETT made an ineffectual motion--yeas 14, nays 25--to lay the
                            motion on the table.
                        
                        The motion to reconsider was agreed to by yeas 23, nays 16.
                        On motion of Mr. COBB, the resolution was laid on the table by yeas 23,
                            nays 16. 
                    
                    
                        BEAUTIFYING THE STREETS.
                        

                        Leave being granted, Mr. GIFFORD introduced a bill[S. 173] to enable the boards of
                            incorporated towns to authorize the use of portions of streets for shade
                            and ornamental purposes, which was read the first time and passed to the
                            second reading.

                    
                    
                        SESSION HOURS.
                        Mr. CASON offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns,
                                        that it do so until to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                                
                            
                        
                        
                        The resolution was adopted by yeas 25, nays 12.
                         And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        MONDAY, February 20, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and directed the roll call to
                        ascertain a quorum.
                    The Clerk reporting no quorum present--
                    On motion by Mr. NEW COMB, a call of the House was ordered and proceeded,
                        and
                    The Clerk recorded 64 members present and answering to their names, viz:
                    
                    
                        

                            
                                
                                    Messrs. Abbett, Atkinson, Banta, Beckett, Bird, Boyd,
                                        Branham, Brown, Burnes, Chambers, Collins, Cox. Croan,
                                        Emerson, Ferris, Foulke, Goodman, Gregg, Gregory of
                                        Montgomery, Gregory of Warren, Griffith, Groves, Hamrick,
                                        Hargrove, Harrison, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover, Hunt, Kilgore,
                                        Lasselle, Lemon, Lockhart, Meredith, Miller of Clinton,
                                        Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb, O'Brien, Olleman, Osborn,
                                        Patterson, Perigo, Reese, Richards. Richardson, Roach,
                                        Sabin, Shoaff of Allen, Shuey, Sim, Spencer, Stewart,
                                        Stivers, Stinger, Trusler, Upson, Veach, Welch, White,
                                        Woods, Wright and Mr. Speaker.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    The SPEAKER now directed the Door-keeper to close the doors of the Hall.
                    Mr. OLLEMAN stated that Mr. Major had left the city sick. Mr. Stackey, also,
                        was absent on leave, on account of sickness in his family.
                    Mr. SPENCER said Mr. Sullivan was absent; on leave.
                    Mr. BROWN moved that further proceedings under the call be dispensed with. In
                        his brief experience he had never seen any good result from these attempts
                        to compel members to come in. We might sit here three hours and not gain the
                        attendance of five members. The posse comitatus of the
                        House could not make a quorum to-day.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB wanted this tried at once. He was satisfied they could bring in a
                        quorum. He referred to the power of the House to absentees.
                     Mr. Brown's motion was rejected.

                    
                        EVACUATION OF CHARLESTON.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB read a piece of intelligence just received by telegraph to
                            this effect: "Gen. Grant telegraphs Stanton that Charleston was
                            evacuated on Tuesday last." [Applause.] This comes from official
                            dispatches for the papers.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN asked leave of absence for Mr. Stucky.
                        Mr. LEMON asked leave of absence for Mr. Lopp.
                        
                         The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks leaves of absence cannot be granted but by
                            a quorum; but gentlemen can be excused for the present from further
                            proceedings under this call.
                         Mr. STUCKEY and Lopp were then excused.
                         Mr. KILGORE moved that further proceedings under the call be now
                            dispensed with.
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren. Mr. Speaker, the Door-keeper desires to know his
                            duties since the doors have been closed.
                        Mr. SPEAKER. The Chair understands that it is the duty of the Door-keeper
                            to open the doors to allow any member to come in, but none to go
                            out.
                        
                        Mr. KILGORE'S motion was then agreed to: affirmative 29, negative 27.
                        So all further proceedings under the call of the House were dispensed
                            with.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the House adjourn.
                        Mr. GROVES was satisfied that if the committee on the Southern
                                Prison should go to Jeffersonville, there would hardly be
                            a quorum before they returned. He was chairman of that committee, and he
                            was willing for a change that would relieve him from service. He
                            considered that one man could do the business as well as the entire body
                            of the committee.
                        The SPEAKER. The House could not make an order without a quorum.
                        Mr. Brown's motion to adjourn was then agreed to.
                        So the House adjourned till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock.
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 21, 1865.
                    
                     The reading of yesterday's journal was begun, when--
                    On motion by Mr. NILES, the farther reading thereof was dispensed with.
                     On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, it was--
                    
                        
                            

                                
                                    Ordered, That the Senate proceed to the
                                    consideration of bills on the third reading:
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        DESTRUCTION OF COUNTY RECORDS.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. WRIGHT, his bill 150, (see page 193 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) for the relief of
                            Jasper county, was read the second time, and passed to the third
                            reading.

                        Subsequently on his farther motion, the Constitutional provision was
                            suspended; the bill read the third time, and passed by yeas 34, nays
                            0.

                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of the bill, S. 38, (page
                            44,) and House bills 84, (p. 111) and 160, (p. 217 )
                    
                    
                        NO QUORUM.
                        Mr. VAWTER demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered and discovered the fact that there was no quorum present,
                            and but four Senators absent without leave.
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, the Doorkeeper was directed to bring in the
                            absentees.
                    
                    
                        AGRICULTURAL REPORTS.
                        Mr. BEESON submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT-The Committee on
                                Agriculture, to which was referred the memorial of the
                            State Board of Agriculture, asking an appropriation to enable them to
                            publish the reports of the State Board of Agriculture, have had the same
                            under consideration, and direct me to report that they deem it
                            inexpedient to make such appropriation. From the fact of the large
                            demands that will necessarily have to be made upon the Treasury,
                            admonishes them that economy should be practiced at every point that
                            will best subserve the public interest.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS objected to concurring in the Committee's report and
                            insisted that the State Agricultural Reports should be printed, as they
                            always contain matter of interest to the people of the State at large.
                            He would like to see this committee report laid on the table.
                        Mr. STAGGS was also in favor of an appropriation for the purpose of
                            printing these Reports of the State Board of Agriculture.
                        On motion by Mr. CASON the report was laid on the table for the
                            present.
                    
                    
                        TOWNSHIP BONDS
                        Mr. BENNETT submitted the following:
                        
                            Mr. PRESIDENT-The Committee on Military
                                Affairs, to whom was referred the petition of John D.
                            Wilson and others, citizens of Pleasant township, in Laporte county,
                            asking for the enactment of a law authorizing township Trustees to issue
                            bonds for the purpose of raising volunteers, have had the same under
                            consideration, and have instructed me to report the same back to the
                            Senate, and recommend that it lie upon the table, as the committee are
                            of the opinion that such legislation would be unwise and
                            inexpedient.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time, and passed to
                            the second reading:
                        By Mr. NILES, [S. 174 ] to provide for the protection of wild game,
                            defining the time in which the same may be taken or killed, and
                            declaring the penalty for the violation of this set, repealing all laws
                            inconsistent therewith, and declaring an emergency.
                        By Mr. NILES, [S. 175,] to authorize the formation of companies for the
                            detection and apprehension of horse thieves and other felons, and for
                            mutual protection, and repealing all laws inconsistent therewith.
                        By Mr. CORBIN, for Mr. Carson, [S. 176] authorizing assessment and levy
                            of tax in the several towns and cities in this State, on real and
                            personal properly of all railroad, companies within the jurisdiction of
                            such towns and cities.
                        By Mr. DUNNING, [S. 177,] for the
                            relief of persons who have paid certain claims to the State, or to the
                            proper officer, under color of judicial proceedings, and to subrogate
                            each persons to the rights of the State. [Read the second time by title,
                            and referred to a select committee, viz: Messrs. Dunning, Niles and
                            Downey ] Subsequently this committee reported in favor of the bill, and
                            it was read the second time, and under a dispensation of the
                            constitutional provision, it was read the third time, and passed by yeas
                            36, nays 0.
                        By Mr. DUNNING, for the Lieutenant Governor, [S. 178,] to authorize the
                            formation of companies for the construction of water works in and for
                            incorporated cities, to enable such cities to subscribe stock in such
                            companies and to issue and sell bonds for the payment thereof. [Read the
                            second time by title and referred to the Committee on Corporations ]
                        By Mr. THOMPSON, [S. 179,] fixing the salaries of the Superintendent of
                            the Hospitals for the Insane, Deaf and Dumb and Blind.
                    
                    
                    
                        OFFICERS OF THE BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS.
                        Senate bill No. 38, (see page 44 of these Reports ) was read the third
                            time.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS objected to the bill because it proposed to legislate for
                            the year 1869. Why legislate at this session of the General Assembly for
                            the Legislature which will meet here two years from now?
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. The passage of the bill may then be delayed till after
                            the President of the Board shall be elected, and that Legislature would
                            feel the same delicacy on this subject that we do now.
                        
                        The bill was rejected by yeas 5, nays 30.
                        Mr. CORBIN, in explanation of his vote, remarked, that he had been
                            laboring very hard to make this bill satisfactory to the Republicans The
                            bill had beep changed and changed again to suit the objections urged
                            against it. As fast as objections were made he had tried to meet them
                            until he had come to the conclusion there could be no bill got up on
                            this subject that will suit them. The last objection urged was, that it
                            was going to turn out of office the present President of these
                            Institutions, but this morning the bill was reported to the Senate,
                            amended so as not to take effect till the term of the present incumbent
                            had expired, and yet they are not satisfied. He regretted that this
                            bill, which would certainly put an end to the facilities for
                            perpetrating so many frauds upon these Institutions, should fail. He
                            regretted that so many Senators should feel it to be their duty to vote
                            against a bill of this kind for reasons which, they themselves, must
                            acknowledge are not very well founded.
                    
                    
                        MOBS AND RIOTS.
                        Senate bill. No. 47, (see page 54) was read the third time.
                        Mr. NILES said that the bill under consideration introduced a new and
                            important principle into our laws. It would give to every inhabitant of
                            a city or county a direct pecuniary interest in the preservation of
                            public order. We should require all our citizens to obey the laws, and
                            should punish them if they do not. But while they obey the laws they
                            ought to be protected in their persons and property. Such a law has been
                            in operation several years in the State of New York, and its operation
                            has been, found to be beneficial. He trusted that the bill would receive
                            the unanimous approval of the Senate.
                        
                        The bill was then passed by yeas 36, nays 0.

                        On motion by Mr. CHAPMAN the bill, [H.
                                R. 14 ] was taken from the table and made the special order
                            for 2 o'clock this afternoon.
                        And then came recess for dinner:
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        
                        Senate bill No. 122--weights and measures (see page 138,) was read the
                            third time and passed by yeas 35, nays 1.

                             Senate bill No. 127 (page 138,) was read the third time and passed

                            Leave being granted Mr. WARD, from the Committee on
                                    Corporations, reported back the bill S. 178 (introduced this
                                morning,) recommending its passage, with the following amendment,
                                adding in the proper place these words: And any railroad company of
                                this State may subscribe for and own stock in such company, and
                                shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other
                                stockholders.
                            The report was concurred in. 
                            On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the bill was read the second time, and
                                ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            THIRD JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT.
                            Senate bill No. 133, was read
                                the third time and laid on the table.
                            
                             Subsequently on motion by Mr. WILLIAMS was taken up and passed by
                                yeas 34, nays 0. 
                        
                        
                            RELIEF OF THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND
                                SEA-MEN.
                            On motion by Mr. CHAPMAN, the Senate resolved itself into a
                                    Committee of the Whole
                                 --Mr. Downey in the chair--and
                                proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this hour,
                                being the relief bill H. R.
                                    14--see pages 142, 143, 144, and 145 of the BREVIER
                                LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                            Mr. VAWTER moved to amend the first section by striking out "three"
                                before the word "mills," and inserting in lieu thereof the word
                                "two." He believed that tax would raise revenue enough. If it would
                                not he would be willing to vote any amount that was sufficient. 
                            Mr. CHAPMAN made a few remarks, in which he made a statement that the
                                total amount of taxable property in the State is $516,800,000, which
                                taxed at three mills, as provided for this bill, would yield
                                $1,550,400 00, and the amount of taxable polls, according to the
                                assessment of this bill, would yield $197,000 00, making a total
                                revenue of $1,747,000 00, from which deduct one-fifth for
                                delinquents--$382,466 00--would leave $1,364,534 00 for distribution
                                among soldiers' families, which estimate will give each wife,
                                mother, or widow about $5 per month, estimating them at fifteen
                                thousands, and $1 per month to each child under twelve years
                                old.
                            Mr BENNETT believed that the Senate will feel willing to take the
                                estimates of the Finance Committee. For one, he
                                should base his vote the data as furnished by that committee, and
                                favored the tax of 30 cents on the $100, as they had recommended. He
                                also contended that the families, the wives and children of our
                                brave soldiers, should all be treated alike, as the Finance
                                    Committee has provided; and that it should not be left
                                to the Township Trustee or any other man, to decide as to what
                                family should receive the benefits of this fund, and what family
                                should not. We make no distinctions in the taxation, and let us make
                                no distinctions in the distribution of the benefits of this bill. He
                                favored the raising of any tax, no matter how large, so it was
                                sufficient to take care of the wives and children of our brave
                                soldiers and children.
                            Mr. CULVER made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the
                                table. 
                            Mr. COBB thought the principle and object of this bill was one of
                                charity. We have arrived at a period in our history when we can only
                                dispense charities to objects upon which our charities should be
                                bestowed. We should confine this bill only to objects that deserve
                                the moneys of the State. If we had the money, it would be well to
                                pay every private soldier $30 or $50 a month. You cannot put a money
                                value on the services the soldier renders when he goes to battle for
                                his country. But we have to partially pay him, and then, after that,
                                we should meet objects on which our charities should be bestowed. It
                                is our duty to enable soldiers' families to live comfortably, and
                                would to God we were not compelled to make distinctions. The
                                principle of this bill is wrong, because it attempts to reach beyond
                                our duty in the case, and include those who are not in need of our
                                charities. The bill provides that the families of all soldiers shall
                                have its benefits, whether they are in need or not.
                            Mr. BENNETT would like to inquire who is going to determine whether
                                the family is needy or not? Would such decision be
                                uniform18throughout the State? Is there any rule by which this
                                distinction could be made just and uniform?
                            Mr. COBB. Certainly. Let the bill provide that its benefits shall be
                                distributed to those families whose heads are worth not more than
                                $1,000, say. This is a bill for bestowing charities, and it should
                                not be viewed in any other light. We have no money, in these times,
                                to bestow upon men, over and above what their services are worth. He
                                would want to disown a residence in a county where the soldiers'
                                wives and children were not properly taken care of.
                            Mr. CORBIN. The question as to the amount of tax depends upon the
                                question as to whether we will extend this benefit to all soldiers'
                                families, or only to those who are needy. And this latter question
                                should be the first one decided. He was satisfied the estimate made
                                by the Committee on Finance of the number of
                                soldiers' families was far too low.
                            Mr. CASON objected to making the workings of this bill as though the
                                recipients were objects of charity. The logic of gentlemen making
                                such arguments was not consistent. The gentleman last up has been an
                                advocate of the Morgan raid bill, and why not discriminate in that
                                bill so that no loss shall be paid to any party worth more than
                                $1,000.
                            Mr. COBB. In that case, property was forcibly taken from them; in
                                this case, we are looking to the good of the family of the soldier,
                                and propose to dispense to them things of which they stand in
                                need.
                            Mr. CASON reviewed the arguments of the gentleman, while contending
                                that the benefits of this bill should be dispensed on the ground of
                                charity; taking the gentleman's conclusions on the Morgan raid bill
                                and applying them to this bill, to show that the gentleman was
                                inconsistent. Mr. Cason had not a feeling in his system that did not
                                abhor the idea of making the wives and children of our soldiers
                                simply objects of charity, under the hand of some petty tyrant who
                                will go around inquiring as to their means. If we make them mere
                                objects of charity, we have poor houses and laws enough already to
                                take care of paupers. He would vote against this bill from first to
                                last, if it be made a charity bill. Suppose one family has $1,000 in
                                cash, and another a house, or stocks worth $1,600: in the former
                                instance, the family can live on this money; but in the latter, how
                                will they get along without selling the house or the stocks? There
                                must be any amount of unjust discriminations, if the plan proposed
                                by the Senator should be adopted, For mercy's sake, let us not make
                                any discriminations in the bill, or make paupers out of soldiers'
                                families.
                            Mr. CULLEN would be second to no man in voting money for the
                                maintainance of the families of volunteers who may need it, and in
                                order to find out what families are needy, let this fund be
                                distributed by the township Trustee. But he would not vote for this
                                bill as long as the money is to be distributed indiscriminately.
                            On motion by Mr. HANNA, the committee rose, reported progress, and
                                asked leave to sit again.
                            
                             Leave was granted for Thursday morning at 9 o'clock.

                            Mr. COBB offered a resolution allowing Samuel G. Thomson six dollars

                                Door-keeper in the organization of the Senate at the session of
                                1863.
                            The resolution was referred to the Committee on
                                    Claims.

                            Senate bill No. 135 (see page
                                162 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS) was read the third time and
                                passed, by yeas 34, nays 0.

                        
                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the Senate took up his resolution, of which
                                he gave notice late in the session of Wednesday afternoon.
                            The resolution failed to pass upon a division--affirmative 15,
                                negative 14--no quorum voting.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         TUESDAY, February, 21, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER directed the roll-call, which ascertained a quorum present and
                        answering to their names.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB moved to suspend the reading of the journal.
                    
                        WHITEWATER VALLEY RAILROAD.
                        Mr. TRUSLER said he wished to change his vote on the passage of Mr.
                            Newcomb's bill, [H. R. 59,] last Friday, because he was satisfied that
                            by the provisions of that bill we were legislating away the rights of
                            the people. There was no provision in that bill to secure the rights of
                            shipping on the Whitewater Canal. Another reason why he wished to change
                            his vote to the negative, was, there was much excitement on account of
                            conflicting interests, between the Junction road and the I. and C. road,
                            on account of the efforts of the latter to get possession of the former,
                            since the people were now for the first time informed of it. They
                            demanded that the canal shall be sold so as to realize the greatest
                            amount,of money and pay the canal debts. The canal was worth a large
                            amount of money, and if sold under competition it was believed that it
                            would sell for enough to pay the entire indebtedness of the canal. He
                            was in favor of a railroad there; but we should not legislate away the
                            rights of individuals without their consent. This road would be built.
                            It was already finished as far as Harrison.
                        But, if the road should not be finished, there was still the same reason
                            for keeping up this canal that there existed for keeping up the Wabash
                            and Erie Canal. His people, he thought, were willing the canal should be
                            sold; but if sold he should realize as much as possible. The canal will
                            bring at least half as much as the embankments are worth. The first men
                            he met at home were the owners of boats on that canal, and they inquired
                            earnestly, what are you going to do with our shipping? This bill No. 59
                            compromised the interests of those men, making no provision to
                            remunerate them. On account of these considerations he wished to vote
                            against the bill.
                        It was ordered that his vote be so recorded on the journal.
                        Mr. ATKINSON asked and obtained leave to change his vote, and record it
                            in the negative on the passage of the same bill.
                        The journals of Friday and Monday were then authenticated without
                            reading.
                        Mr. FOULKE asked whether it would be in order to move a reconsideration
                            of the vote on the passage of the bill No. 59?
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman's object could be obtained by sending for a
                            return of the bill from the Senate.
                        Mr. BROWN obtained leave to record his vote in the negative on the Senate
                            joint resolution No 16, for the
                            proposed Constitutional amendment.
                        Mr. RICE asked and obtained leave to record his vote in the affirmative
                            on the same matter.

                            the Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. ATKINSON, Mr. LANE, Mr. FOULKE and Mr. CHAMBERS presented petitions
                            for amendment of the Liquor law, so as to require the applicant for

                            population in the ward or township interested, which were referred to
                            the Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. McVEY presented a memorial, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Education without reading.

                            summer of 1863, which were referred to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary.

                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned Mr. harrison's bill [H. R. 21,] to amend the 222d section of
                            the Misdemeanor act of June 14, 1852, with an amendment, striking out
                            and inserting: "Every person who shall be guilty of notorious lewdness,
                            or who shall in any public place make an uncovered or indecent exposure
                            -- --, shall be fined not less than $10, nor more than $100, to which
                            may be added imprisonment not exceeding three month;" and when so

                         He also returned Mr. Harrison's bill [H. R. 44,] to amend the 76th

                            orphan children-reporting adversely.
                        It was indefinitely postponed.

                            for bounties, &c; and adding a new section.
                        Mr. REESE, from the Select Committee on Constitutional
                                Amendments, returned Mr. Wood's joint resolution [H. R. 2]
                            to amend the eighth article of the Constitution so as to authorize the
                            people of incorporated cities, towns, townships and school districts to
                            tax themselves for school purposes, recommending its passage.
                        He also returned Mr. Wood's joint resolution No. 3 to amend the
                            twenty-third section of article four of the State Constitution, so as to
                            provide for the same thing, without reference to a uniform rate of
                            taxation, recommending its passage.
                        He also returned, from the same committee, Mr. Meredith's joint
                            resolution, [H. R. 1,] proposed to amend the State Constitution by
                            striking out the thirteenth article thereof, with  the recommendation of the majority of said
                            committee that the resolution does pass.
                        Mr. HARRISON, from the minority of said committee, reported a
                            recommendation that said resolution be laid on the table.
                    
                    
                        WHITE WATER VALLEY RAILROAD.
                        Mr. FOULKE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved,That the Senate be requested to
                                        return the bill No. 59 to this House for further
                                        consideration.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. LOCKHART would be glad to have this bill returned. It was but justice
                            that the bill should be reconsidered, because it contained no adequate
                            guarantee of the right of parties. We are willing to so amend it, that
                            parties purchasing the canal shall be compelled to build a railroad, or
                            forfeit.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. If the bill comes back, we shall consume the whole session on
                            it.
                        Mr. BROWN agreed with Mr. Wright. He disputed the right of the House to
                            recall the bill. The resolution would be a breach of decorum. We should
                            not take up so much time on one proposition. He would not balance the
                            interests of the people of the entire State against the owners of a few
                            canal boats. We could not pass a bill here to infringe or impair the
                            rights of private Property that could have any force of law. The bill
                            could be considered when it should come back amended from the
                            Senate.
                        Mr. SHUEY. If this bone of contention comes back it will consume precious
                            time.--Gentlemen could take their new found mare's nest to the
                            Senate. He
                            demanded the previous question; and then, under the force thereof the
                            resolution was rejected-yeas 20, nays 51-Messrs. Chambers, Cox, Emerson,
                            Foulke, Glazebrook, Groves, Hogate. Hoover, Lee, Lemon, Lockhart, Lopp,
                            McVey, Olleman, Rice, Sabin, Sim, Stewart, Trusler and Willis, voting in
                            the affirmative.
                        Mr. KILGORE submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        MILITARY AUDITING COMMITTEE.
                                    
                                    
                                        Resolved by the Senate, the House of
                                                Representatives concurring therein, That there
                                            shall be appointed a committee consisting of one member
                                            on the part of the Senate, and two on the part of the
                                            House of Representatives, to be denominated an
                                                Auditing Committee, whose duty it
                                            shall be to meet at Indianapolis monthly, and examine
                                            and audit the accounts of the Commissary General and
                                            Quartermaster General, and all other accounts either for
                                            the pay of men, or material of any kind purchased and
                                            designed to be paid for out of appropriations heretofore
                                            made, or which may hereafter be made, for military
                                            purposes, including payment of the Indiana Legion, if an
                                            appropriation has been, or shall be made therefor, and
                                            that the Auditor of State be expressly prohibited from
                                            paying any claim of the description aforesaid, until
                                            said claim has been audited and certified by said
                                                Auditing Committee, or a majority
                                            of it.
                                        
                                            Resolved, That said committee shall
                                            make out a regular balance sheet each month, which,
                                            together with the proper vouchers, shall be carefully
                                            preserved. They shall have power to direct the proper
                                            forms to be used for accounts and vouchers, and require
                                            all to be made in accordance with such forms.
                                        
                                            Resolved, That said committee shall
                                            each receive the sum of three dollars for each day they
                                            may be necessarily employed in the discharge of their
                                            duties, and five cents per mile for the distance
                                            traveled going to and returning from their attendance
                                            upon such duties, the same to be paid out of the money
                                            appropriated for the payment of the legislative expenses
                                            of the present General Assembly, and that the Auditor is
                                            hereby directed to audit the accounts for the services
                                            of such committee, upon the certificate of a majority of
                                            the committee.
                                        
                                            Resolved, That said committee shall
                                            examine and determine all claims preserved to them for
                                            allowance without delay; and that said committee shall
                                            only be entitled to receive pay for the time during
                                            which they shall have been actually employed.
                                        
                                            Resolved, That a majority of said
                                            committee shall constitute a quorum for business, but no
                                            allowance of such majority of any claim or account shall
                                            be valid, so as to authorize its payment, unless such
                                            allowance be made by a number of said committee, equal
                                            to a majority of the whole.
                                        
                                            Resolved, That said committee shall
                                            only be authorized to sit as long as the duties herein
                                            imposed upon them may demand; and whenever said claims
                                            and accounts shall be fully examined and audited, said
                                            committee shall be and is hereby discharged.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. KILGORE said he had introduced this at the request of the Governor.
                            He considered that three men could do the work as well as five, the
                            number appointed last session. Having been a member of the former
                            auditing committee, he was prepared to say that it would save thousands
                            of dollars to the State.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was not prepared to vote for the resolution. He thought the
                            powers, duties, and jurisdiction of that committee should be better
                            defined than by the law of 1883. He therefore moved that the resolution
                            be referred to a select committee of three, with instructions to report
                            another resolution defining the jurisdiction of the committee.
                        It was so ordered.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB introduced a bill [H. R. 179,] for an act to amend section 1
                            of the act to incorporate the Trustees of the Indianapolis Female
                            College, approved February 13, 1857:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH now called up his committee bill, reported this morning,
                            viz: a bill [H. R. 130,] for an act to regulate the practice of
                            medicine, surgery and obstetrics within the State of Indiana, and
                            another properly connected therewith:
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, introduced a bill [H. R. 181,] for an act to amend
                            the seventh section of the act prescribing the duties of clerks,
                            approved June 7, 1852:
                         Which was passed to the second reading and referred to a select
                            committee of five.
                        Mr. SHUEY introduced a bill [H. R. 182] for an act regulating the sale ot
                            real estate made by county treasurers for the non-payment of taxes and
                            to establish tax titles-
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, introduced a bill [H. R. 183] for an act
                            authorizing a tax levy for the support of schools, &c.-
                         Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. ATKINSON introduced a bill [H. R. 184] for an act to amend the act
                            regulating fines and fees, and repealing former acts in relation
                            thereto- -
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Fees and Salaries.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE, (by request,) introduced a bill [H. R. 185] for an act to
                            provide for the election of Directors of Corporations, and pre- [pre]vent the forfeiture of their
                            franchises in certain cases:
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the (now presented) report of the
                                Military Auditing Committee be spread on the
                            journal, and that a copy be referred to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means. 
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    
                    
                        THE CALENDAR.
                        Mr. COFFROTH demanded the consideration of the regular order of business
                            on the calendar. 
                        The bill [S. 100] fixing the
                            compensation of Township Assessors--
                         The bill [S. 128] making appropriations to pay the interest on the State
                            University bonds for 1863 and 1864-
                        Were severally passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                        GOVERNOR'S RESIDENCE.
                        The bill [541] appointing commissioners to sell town lots belonging to
                            the State, and provide a residence for the Governor, was passed to the
                            second reading,
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to suspend the constitutional restriction, and that the
                            bill be read the second time now. He described the provisions of the
                            bill; urged the necessity for a residence for the Governor, and the fact
                            that, if the property is to be sold it ought to be done at once, when it
                            is in demand.
                        Mr. LASSELLE was opposed to dispensing with constitutional restrictions.
                            Many other bills on the calendar were as important as this.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. BUSKIRK, and Mr. COFFROTH regarded this as a measure
                            demanding prompt action, and considered it expedient to suspend the
                            constitutional restriction.
                        
                        The restriction was suspended--yeas 59, nays 11-and the bill was read the
                            second time.
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB the bill was referred to a select committee of
                            three.

                        The bill[S. 68] to change the name
                            of the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad, to Terre Haute and
                            Indianapolis Railroad Company, giving further time &c., was taken up
                            and passed to the second reading.
                        On motion by Mr. MEREDITH it was referred to the Committee on
                                Railroads.
                        The bill [S. 5] to. amend section 601 of the general practice act, was
                            taken up and passed to the second reading, and referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        The bill [S. 30] to authorize the
                            sale of rail roads, &c., was taken up and passed to the second
                            reading.
                        On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, amended by Mr. MONTGOMERY, the regular order
                            of business was suspended, and the House proceeded to the consideration
                            of House bills on the third reading.
                    
                    
                        RAILROADS.
                        Mr. Rice's bill, Equal-footing Railroad bill No. 9, (see page 45,) coming
                            up, it was ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.
                        On the final vote there was no quorum voting, but a majority for the
                            bill. So it lies over.
                         Mr. RICE stated the object of the bill. It was to repeal former
                            legislative restrictions of railroads, such as requiring that the
                            earnings of railroads over 15 per cent, shall shall go into the Treasury
                            of the State; thus placing all railroads on the same footing in regard
                            to dividends and profits.
                        Mr. HENRICKS considered it unfortunate that this bill did not provide for
                            equality and limitations in regard to what shall be charged for
                            passengers and freights. The railroad system cannot be dispensed with,
                            but he would not allow them to do with us as they please. The Southern
                            Michigan and Northern Illinois charged more for freight and passengers
                            from his town to New York, than the road charged for freight and
                            passengers from Chicago to New York.
                        The SPEAKER said there was nothing before the House. The bill will go
                            over till to-morrow. 
                    
                    
                        STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.
                         Mr. HOGATE'S bill, [H. R. 20,]
                            for the encouragement of agriculture, authorizing the State Board to
                            sell, purchase and hold real estate, &c, (see p. 64,) was taken up,
                            ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK believed that the provision exempting all the property of the
                            State Board from taxation, was in conflict with the Constitution.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB read from article 10, and held this right to an exceptional
                            case, as an institution for "scientific purposes,"
                        
                        The yeas and nays on the final passage resulted-yeas 51, nays 11-no
                            quorum voting; and a second vote was ordered thereon.
                        Mr. LASSELLE made an ineffectual motion for leave of absence for Mr.
                            Gregg.
                        On motion of Mr. HENRICKS, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.

                        
                            THE PUBLIC DEBT.
                            Mr. BRANHAM (by unanimous consent) introduced a bill [H. R. 186,] for
                                an act declaring the law now in force sufficient to authorize the
                                payment of the semi-annual interest on the public debt, to authorise
                                the payment thereof, and providing for the punishment of any
                                violation of the requirements of this act, &c.
                            Which was passed to the second reading. 
                        
                        
                            STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.
                            The SPEAKER announced the unfinished business of the morning, viz:
                                the vote on the final passage of Mr. Hogate's Agricultural bill, No.
                                20.
                            The bill was again read through by the Clerk.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB explained the provisions of the bill. It was in part to
                                legalize the State Board's purchase of the Camp Morton lands. He
                                moved to reconsider the vote whereby the bill was ordered to the
                                third reading.
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            On his further motion, it was referred to a Select Committee of
                                Three.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY BONDS.

                            The SPEAKER announced the special order,the consideration of the
                                Senate bill No. 3, le-  [le]galizing county bonds,
                                &c., and the amendments pending-[heretofore described in these
                                Reports-] reported from the majority and minority of the select
                                committee thereon. The first question being on the amendment of the
                                minority-
                            Mr. WRIGHT. In his county the county officers published the amount at
                                $250, which they would pay to each man by way of bounty, to the
                                number of men called for. But ten men more than, necessary to fill
                                the quota volunteered and went into the service without bounty. The
                                minority amendment was to secure the payment of bounty in such
                                cases. There was a surplus of seven recruits in Switzerland county
                                in the same condition.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK explained the provisions of the bill, as amended by the
                                majority of the select committee. The first branch of the minority
                                report was, that soldiers should receive a credit to the amount of
                                the county levy on their property. He insisted on the force of the
                                legal principle, that what can not be done directly, can not be done
                                by indirection.
                            He would cheerfully exempt the property of soldiers, if he could do
                                so under the State Constitution. The second division of the minority
                                amendment would give a bounty to every man that has entered the
                                service without home bounty. He considered that his report,
                                presented on Friday morning, covered the whole constitutional
                                question in this regard. Let us do right, and it anybody finds
                                fault, let us refer them to the Constitution. 
                        
                        
                            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
                            [A message was now received from the Governor by Mr. Sulgrove, his
                                private Secretary, transmitting a communication from sundry citizens
                                of Tippecanoe county, proposing to donate buildings and eight acres
                                attached, the Tippecanoe battle-ground, forty-eight acres; another
                                lot of 200 in Tippecanoe county; and another lot of 100 acres in the
                                northern part of' the State, and $10,000 in money, towards the
                                endowment ot the State Agricultural College, as an inducement for
                                the location of said college at the Battle Ground.
                            [The message and communication was referred to the Committee
                                    on Education.]
                        
                        
                            COUNTY BONDS.
                            Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the bill by adding a clause to repeal the
                                act of 1861 to appropriate money for the encouragement of
                                volunteering, &c. He said the reason of this amendment was that
                                the law of 1861 was the authority under which these county
                                commissioners had acted. Judge Bicknell, in a case just decided in
                                the Jackson Circuit Court, had held that they had no authority to
                                issue these bonds. He read from the act of 1861. Under this act
                                several boards of commissioners have endeavored to borrow money to
                                pay bounties. He respectfully submitted that it was no law at all,
                                and that it ought to be swept from the statute book.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. The gentleman's amendment was only a little broader than
                                the provisions of the bill.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. His county commissioners had acted for years
                                under that act, and took a different construction. We were not bound
                                by the decision of the Circuit Judge.
                            Mr. CHAMBERS proposed to amend the report of the majority by striking
                                out section third, which was read for information.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB showed that, if this bill and Mr. Branbam's bill No. 14,
                                should both pass, the act of 1861 would be repealed; but he wanted
                                to preserve that portion of the act which authorizes care for
                                soldiers' families. He did not want to see this bill weighed down
                                with amendments. 
                            Mr. GRIFFITH. We bad spent a good deal of time on this bill, and as
                                he saw it was to be loaded down with amendments, he demanded the
                                previous question.
                            Mr. KILGORE suggested that the bill ought to go to the
                                    Committee of the Whole House.
                            The SPEAKER There was no order to that effect.
                            Mr. COFFROTH desired that the bill might be perfected.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH withdrew his demand for the previous question.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE did not regard the section reported by the minority as
                                in conflict with the Constitution. He submitted that the authorities
                                quoted in Mr. Buskirk's report had no bearing on the amendment. The
                                minority amendment did not refer to the assessment, nor the
                                taxation, but simply to the collection. There was a vote taken here
                                but the other day to exempt whole townships from taxation. It was
                                the practice and the law, that where a person goes out and works on
                                the roads, he is entitled to a credit for his road tax. Now, while
                                the majority report requires uniformity of levy and assessment, it
                                is silent about the collection. Here, in the minority amendment, was
                                simply a credit for this levy and assessment on account of services
                                rendered in the field. Admit that there was a question of doubt
                                involved as to its legality, still our act should be on the side of
                                the equity of the case. And who doubted the equity here? It
                                certainly was not right to tax soldiers' property to enable us to
                                stay at home.
                             Mr. HUMPHREYS concurred with Mr. Whiteside so far as the minority
                                report is concerned. There was certainly in it something of justice
                                to the soldiers. But as to the whole bill it would have to pass
                                without his vote. He looked upon it as apart of that grand fanatical
                                scheme which was fast amercing the State in bankruptcy. He could see
                                nothing better to grow out of it. He preferred to stop where we are.
                                He would not hurt the soldiers' interest. He believed that these
                                bonds were mostly in the hands of speculators, for whose benefit he
                                believed they were issued at first.
                            Mr. WRIGHT was in favor of Mr. Brown's amendment. He said:
                            Sir, I know not what course others may take in regard to this bill, I
                                speak for myself only I am opposed to the passage of this bill
                                because I believe the bill wrong, but if it must pass, I want my
                                amendment to pass with it, shielding the property of soldiers from
                                excution and sale for the taxes that this bill proposes to levy.
                            Some may think this amendment unconstitutional, but I cannot find one
                                clause in the Constitution that forbids us from  property from execution. We have a law
                                exempting three hundred dollars' worth of property from execution
                                for debts. Government bonds are not taxable. And we have a law
                                exempting the property of members of fire companies. If we can do
                                all this, I would ask, in the name of justice, that we also exempt
                                the property of soldiers-not from taxation, but from execution and
                                sale. 
                            Sir, I will oppose any bill that proposes to tax, execute and sell
                                the property of soldiers In the field, fighting for my Goverament. I
                                will oppose all bills proposing to tax those who have volunteered to
                                put down this rebellion--those that have stood the heat and burthen
                                of the day in this war. I will oppose any bill that proposes to tax
                                the old man that has given up his last son for the Union. I will
                                oppose any bill that proposes to tax the man that has been drafted
                                and furnished a substitute, for which he has paid his money. And
                                above all this, I will oppose any bill that proposes to tax the
                                widows and orphans, whose husbands and fathers' bones lie to-day
                                bleaching on the field of battle, for such a purpose as this.
                            I do not believe it is right to tax the soldier to raise a fund to
                                shield a few members on this floor, and their neighbors from the
                                draft. I do act believe it is right to sell their property at public
                                sale, while they are at the front, standing like a wall of fire
                                between us and danger, for any such purposes.
                            Sir, I know gentlemen say their people want it; but, sir, I say to
                                those members, their soldiers in the field-those that have gone
                                through all the dangers and hardships of this war, do not want it.
                                Will you tax the brave boys in the field for the benefit of a few
                                cowards at home? I know that many a good and brave man may be
                                willing to be taxed to fill up our armies, but he is not willing to
                                see the soldier taxed who has served out his time. Perhaps be does
                                not know that we cannot tax him without taxing the soldier and
                                widow, under our constitution. But where is the justice in so doing?
                                We may have another draft-what are you going to do? Will you
                                continue to issue more bonds for every draft until you bankrupt the
                                State? From the report of members, we find that to fill the present
                                call on our State for twenty-two thousand men, the several counties
                                have issued over twelve millions of dollars worth of bonds. Look at
                                this enormous debt-will you continue to increase it if we have
                                another draft? Aye, sir, you must do so, or you will not deal out
                                justice. Will you refuse to raise a bounty to relieve your citizens'
                                from the first draft? Raise a bounty for the second and refuse to
                                give any bounty should we have another draft? Will you tax all alike
                                to redeem those bonds issued for the benefit of the few? Is it
                                right? Is it just?
                            But we are told that this bill is to legalize the act of the County
                                Commissioners. Sir,this is the best argument against it. We should
                                not legalize the illegal acts of our county officers. Illegal acts
                                involved this country in a desolating war, and made paupers of all
                                those States that indorsed them. Shall we pauperize our people by
                                following suit? But, sir, I am told by members upon this floor, that
                                the people demand it. Sir, we live in a day of excitement that
                                clouds the judgment of men. In times of excitement like the present
                                the popular will may be the public folly, and the impulse of the
                                moment the madness of the hour, hence it becomes our duty, as the
                                representatives of the people, to guard against the unreasoning
                                passions of men. It is our duty to guard not only the present but
                                the future welfare of our constituents. If there ever was time that
                                we ought to husband our resources this is the time, that we may not
                                fail to put down this rebellion for want of the money to carry on
                                the war.
                            If every voter in my county was to instruct me to vote for this bill,
                                I wouldn't do it; I would resign my seat and go home; I will not sit
                                here, a mean thing, to move only when my constituents pull the
                                strings. Sir, it is my duty to guard well every bill increasing the
                                taxes at this time if we would avoid the infatuations of 1836 Then
                                we were told that an extra hen and. chickens would pay all the extra
                                tax that would be required to complete the internal improvement
                                system of this State. But, sir, when the taxes had to be paid, what
                                did we see? We saw the people unable to pay them, with all their
                                resources-property advertised on every gate post all over the
                                State-property sold for taxes at ruinous sacrifice to the owners,
                                until mob law was inaugurated, and no man allowed to bid on property
                                offered for sale to pay taxes. Can we learn nothing from the past
                                history of our State? But gentlemen say we must fill up our armies.
                                I answer, the Government has the power to fill our armies, and will
                                do it. Look at the young men idly crowding your streets to-day. Are
                                they any better than those that have been or are now in the field,
                                fighting for the liberty they and we enjoy? Will you tax the
                                soldier's widow and orphan to shield those young men that have not
                                the patriotism to induce them to rally to their country's rescue?
                                You may, sir; but I will be the last man on this floor to cast my
                                vote for any such purpose.
                            Mr. STEWART should vote against all the amendments. And he should
                                vote against the three years time. He was opposed to county
                                involements beyond the current year. His county had issued bonds to
                                a large amount. He had no assurance that we could pay the tax in
                                three years better than we can pay it now. Let us pay as we go. He
                                considered this bounty system at the commencement was not right; but
                                as we had gone on he would legalize them, and stop there.
                            Mr. BROWN'S county was not interested in this bill. They had filled
                                their quota by voluntary contributions. He replied to the argument
                                for credit on account of service in the field, founded on section 1,
                                of article 10 of the State Constitution. This service in the field
                                was not rendered to the State of Indiana, as work on the roads is
                                rendered, and wholly out of the range of the argument. In reply to
                                Mr. Whiteside's ingenious distinction between levy and assessment
                                and collection for taxation, he showed that taxation implies all
                                these. Let us pass a law which the courts will sustain. He made an
                                argument for the repeal of the act of 1861, replying to Mr. Newcomb,
                                and denying that this act of 1861 authorized commissioners to borrow
                                     money. It was only a
                                stumbling block for the commissioners. He examined the question at
                                some length. So far as legalizing these bonds was concerned, he
                                should probably vote for it.
                            Mr. CHURCH referred to the opposition on the bill by Mr. Wright and
                                Mr. Kilgore. He should vote against any amendment from that quarter.
                                Our counties did not ask us for such little things as gentlemen are
                                pleased here to connect with the soldiers' interests. He showed that
                                all amendments to the Senate bill had been hostile. The friends of
                                legalizing these bonds must stand by the Senate bill No. 3. He
                                desired gentlemen to commence voting. He should vote against the
                                amendment to exempt soldiers' property, but he would vote for such a
                                proposition fairly presented in an independent proposition. He had
                                about 200 soldiers up here holding about $50,000 of these bonds. He
                                wanted to reach the pockets of those that had done nothing for the
                                war. His county had issued about $80,000 in these bonds, and they
                                could pay it without bankruptcy. He wanted legalization so that the
                                collections could proceed. He also showed how bounties had been
                                bestowed on those now in the field by individual contributions. This
                                bill did not propose as much to each recruit as had been already
                                given by his county to soldiers' families. He moved to lay all
                                amendments on the table, but withdrew the motion for--
                            Mr. KILGORE. He had listened with a good deal of interest to the
                                gentleman from Porter. He was amongst the first to oppose this bill;
                                but he had asked only that the bill be printed. When that was denied
                                then as a means not of defeating the bill entirely, we had offered
                                amendments, and it went to a select committee and came back in a
                                worse shape than it was before. What were the features of the bill?
                                Gentlemen come in asking that these bonds, be legalized. Petitions
                                for this object, might have come from the county of Fountain. But,
                                on the other hand, we have memorials that frauds have been committed
                                by the County Commissioners. These Commissioners placed in the hands
                                of an agent, a Mr. Reynolds, a bond for $500, and $250 more for each
                                volunteer that he would procure.
                            He came over to Indianapolis and hired recruits for $400, and put the
                                extra $300 in his pocket. Gentlemen talk about this being justice to
                                the soldiers in the field. These bonds were issued to save a class
                                of men at home from the draft. On one side was Madison county,
                                issuing $400 bounty, and on the other side the patriotic county of
                                Henry. These bonds were not issued to soldiers, but to agents. But
                                Delaware county, lying between Henry and Madison, had issued no
                                bonds of so large an amount. These Madison county boys came over and
                                obtained our recruits. And now we must put our hands down deep into
                                our pockets and draw out $750 for each recruit, to compete with the
                                richer counties.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. Would you cheat your own citizens out of bounty, who
                                have gone over and recruited in Madison?
                            Mr. KILGORE. They ought to be cheated for going over to serve for
                                that copperhead county. Suppose we had a proposition for a general
                                State tax to pay these bounties, it would raise a howl against it by
                                those counties where they have filled their quotas: and if it would
                                be unequal as to counties, would it not be equally unequal and us
                                just in the cases where the townships have filled their quotas? He
                                would not take the first step in a matter which, if carried out as
                                justice and equity requires, will bankrupt the State. The amendments
                                offered by the gentleman from Jefferson and the gentleman from
                                Wabash and Kosciusko met his approbation. In all cases where men
                                have served without bounty they ought still to have it. He spoke
                                particularly against the bill, because there was no provision in it
                                against the frauds he had referred to. [Ten minutes expires.]
                            Mr. RICE proposed an amendment, which was read for information,
                                providing that the provisions of this act shall not be construed to
                                apply to bonds issued sines the 20th of December, 1864.
                            Mr. Brown's amendment was rejected.
                            The next question was on the adoption of the minority amendment. The
                                first branch being to declare that service in the field shall be
                                accepted as a credit for the tax.
                            Mr. BROWN moved to amend the amendment by striking out the words "or
                                have been." 
                            Mr. GRIFFITH. It must be apparent to all, that the object of these
                                amendments of the gentlemen from Jefferson and Delaware was to kill
                                the bill. Those who vote for the minority amendment, will vote
                                against the bill. He might vote for the minority amendment, so as
                                not to appear to vote against the soldiers interests. He proposed to
                                do right, and vote for the right wherever he found it. He wanted to
                                vote to legalize not merely the act of the Commissioners, but the
                                act of the people.
                             Mr. BUSKIRK showed that the ground or opposition had been
                                shifted-first open and then covert and by indirection. He read from
                                the decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, to dissipate the
                                ingenious distinction made by Mr. Whiteside, between the
                                "assessment" and "collection" of taxes.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE. Why was it that service on the road was accepted as
                                credit for road tax. And why had we a law for the exemption of
                                firemen?
                             Mr. BUSKIRK supposed that legislation had been passed under much the
                                same pressure that this amendment is proposed to be passed.
                             Mr. WRIGHT said the soldiers did not, want this bill. They did not
                                want to be taxed for the benefit of those that now go out to serve
                                but one-year. He spoke against striking out the words "or have
                                been." He thought those who have been in the field should be
                                relieved at least from the burden of the tax proposed fill the
                                present draft. The amendment of the minority only proposed to
                                relieve those who have served three years without bounty. The other
                                branch of the amendment provides for those cases where soldiers went
                                out and left their bounties in the hands of the county commissioners
                                unpaid.
                            
                            Mr. Brown's amendment striking out "or have been," was rejected--yeas
                                6, nays 67.
                            The question was now taken, on the first division of the minority
                                amendment. The  and nays being
                                demanded, ordered and thereon, resulted--yeas 41, nays 33--as
                                follows:

                                        NAYS.--Messrs. Abbett, Beckett, Bird, Bonner, Brown,

                            So the first section of the minority amendment was agreed to.
                            The question recurred on the second section of the minority
                                amendment.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB spoke against this amendment, as a device of the enemies
                                of the bill. No man could estimate what the sum authorized by this
                                amendment would amount to.
                            Mr. WRIGHT. It applies to no soldiers that have volunteered when
                                there was no bounty offered by County Commissioners.
                            Mr. SHUEY. If that amendment is adopted it will compel eight or nine
                                of its friends to vote against the bill.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK said the amendment just applied having destroyed the
                                constitutionality of the bill, he was now with its enemies. He
                                proposed to amend the amendment by adding these words: "Provided
                                that all counties that have not offered bounties be required to give
                                bounties."
                            Mr. HERSHEY moved to lay the amendment to the amendment on the
                                table.
                            
                            The motion was agreed to--yeas 64, nays 10.
                            Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the amendment by adding: ''That all
                                persons who have contributed money for obtaining volunteers, shall
                                have the amount so contributed refunded to them out of the treasury
                                of the county in which they reside.
                            The SPEAKER now caused to be read a telegraphic dispatch to Governor
                                Morton to the effect that the War Department had received an
                                official report from General Gilmore, announcing the surrender of
                                Charleston to the forces under his command, at 9 o'clock Saturday
                                morning-200 guns captured. The enemy burnt cotton, commissary stores
                                and two ironclads in the ship yards. [Cheers.] 
                            On motion of Mr. BROWN--at 5:20--the House adjourned till to-morrow
                                morning 9 o'clock.

                            in operation in Iowa, and also for a law punishing intoxication, which
                            was referred to the Committee on Temperance without
                            reading.
                        Mr. CORBIN presented a petition from J. G. Osborne and three other

                            was referred to the select committee on fees and

                                    Upon which his excellency remarks: "The site of the
                                        Tippecanoe Battle Ground is a beautiful and healthy one,
                                        with a pleasant admixture of timber and prairie surrounding
                                        it. The citizens are generally wealthy and intelligent, and
                                        the agricultural interests well developed and progressive.
                                        The historic associations are honorable and gratifying. The
                                        proposition is a liberal one, and doubtless well secured. I
                                        trust it will receive your careful consideration among other
                                        propositions relating to the same subject.

                                3--see page 17 of these reports. 
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to refer the bill and amendments to a select committee
                            of five.
                        Mr. RICHMOND spoke against the motion to refer, and in favor of the
                            printing of the House amendment. The vote upon this bill, if it passes,
                            will tell upon Indiana after every head here is laid low in death.

                            table and printed, and ventured to say that there never was a bill
                            before the Senate in which the people took so much interest.
                         This motion was rejected by yeas 15, nays 22.

                        And then the Senate adjourned.

                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM, Mr. HOGATE, and Mr. NEWCOMB presented claims, which were
                            referred to the Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. ATKINSON presented a temperance memorial, signed by sundry citizens
                            of Benton county: which was referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK presented the petition of sundry citizens of Monroe county
                            praying for such amendments of the Constitution of the State of Indiana
                            and of the United States as shall more distinctly acknowledge God as the
                            source of all authority in human Government, and the Lord Jesus Christ
                            as the Supreme Ruler, &c. He stated that he recognized to the
                            fullest and broadest extent the right to petition the General Assembly
                            upon any and all subjects, and because he recognized that right he
                            presented this petition, at the same time stating distinctly that he did
                            not indorse any portion of it. He supposed it should take the direction
                            of other petitions on the same matter and moved that it be referred to
                            the special committee on constitutional amendments.
                        It was so referred.

                        Which were referred to the Committee on the
                            Judiciary.
                        Mr. BROWN stated that, on the 11th of February, 1858, Joseph Watkins and
                            his wife mortgaged certain lands to the Commissioners of the Sinking
                            Fund to secure the loan of $500. Subsequently the wife obtains a
                            divorce, and the land are sold by the husband. The wife brings an action
                            for her claim to the funds, alleging that her name was forged in the
                            conveyance, and the Sinking Fund Commissioners refuse to pay the costs
                            of her suit. He thought that her costs should be allowed, and that was
                            the subject of the petition. He moved that, without reading, the
                            petition and papers be referred to the Committee on the Sinking
                                Fund.
                        They were so referred.
                        Mr. CHURCH presented the memorial of the officers and county
                            commissioners of Porter county for a law to facilitate the collection of
                            revenue, and for legislation to guard against abuses of the elective
                            franchise, by making the payment of taxes a qualification.
                        It was referred to the special committee on that subject.
                        He also presented the petition of sundry citizens of Porter county,
                            asking for the protection of law against incompetent medical
                            practitioners, which was laid on the table--a bill having been already
                            introduced on that subject.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB presented the memorial of the officers and members of the
                            Merchants' Exchange of the city of Indianapolis, for such increase of
                            the school tax as would admit of keeping up the common schools ten
                            months in the year.
                        He also presented the memorial of the President and Secretary of the
                            Board of Public Schools of the city of Indianapolis of similar
                            import.
                        They were severally referred to the Committee on
                                Education.
                        He also presented the memorial of J. H. Woodburn, Superintendent of the
                            Insane Hospital, asking remuneration or extra services--$500.
                        Which was referred to the Committee on Scientific and Benevolent
                                Institutions.
                    
                    
                        COMMITTEES.
                        
                        
                        The SPEAKER now announced the following committee appointments.
                        Committee on Banks--Mr. Lane in the place of Mr. Puett.
                        Committee on the Affairs of the City of Indianapolis--Mr. Lane in the
                            place of Mr. Colover.
                        Special Committee on Senate bill No.
                                41: Messrs. Newcomb, Buskirk and Branham
                        Special Committee on Mr. Hogate's State Board of Agriculture bill [H. R. No. 20]: Messrs. Newcomb,
                            Shoaff of Allen, and Hamrick.
                        Special Committee on Mr. Whiteside's Nonresident Notice bill [H. R. No.
                            18]: Messrs. Shoaff of Allen, Coffroth, Griffith, Lassalle and
                            Buskirk.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            returned the bill [H. R. 159] introduced February 10, with clerical
                            amendments, and an abstract thereof.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the Abstract giving all the changes from the
                            old law, was laid on the table, and 300 copies thereof ordered to be
                            printed--100 for the Senate, and 200 for the House.
                    
                    
                        MASTER COMMISSIONERS.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the same committee, returned Mr. Thacher's bill [H. R.
                            142] to amend sections 4 and 5 of the act of March 2, 1853, authorizing
                            Judges to appoint Master Commissioners, so as to allow Masters to grant
                            writs of habeas corpus, &c., recommending that it be indefinitely
                            postponed.
                        Mr. BROWN hoped the House would now concur in the report. He moved to
                            recommit the bill to a select committee.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The bill gives to Master Commissioners authority to issue
                            writs of habeas corpus.
                        Mr. BROWN. Under the present law you cannot get a Judge to go out of his
                            county for this purpose. The bill was introduced to remedy this.
                        Mr. THACHER said it was the wish of the lawyers in his county to have the
                            bill passed. They had furnished it to him.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. The gentleman from Marion perhaps did not experience the
                            inconveniences about obtaining habeas corpus, or injunction or restoring
                            order, because he has the judge always with him here.
                        
                         Mr. NEWCOMB withdrew his opposition to recommitment, stating, however,
                            his unalterable purpose to oppose authorizing Master Commissioners to
                            serve writs of habeas corpus.
                        
                        The vote on the motion to recommit, was--affirmative 36, negative 30--no
                            quorum. But, the roll-call having discovered a quorum, (84 members) the
                            bill was recommitted to the Committee on the
                                Judiciary--affirmative 47, negative 28.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned Mr. McVey's bill [H. R. 135.] to amend section 651 of the Code
                            of Practice, recommending its passage.
                    
                    
                        SOLDIERS' VOTE BILL.
                        Mr. KILGORE, from the same committee, returned Mr. Branham's Soldiers'
                            Vote bill [H. R. 137,] with amendments by way of a new bill, and the
                            title amended so as to read: "A bill to provide for the voting of
                            electors of the State of Indiana, and absent therefrom in the military
                            or naval service of the United States; (not in the regular service;) and
                            prescribing punishment," &c. And so amended, the committee
                            recommended its passage.
                        Mr. KILGORE moved a suspension of the constitutional restriction to admit
                            of the second reading of the bill by its title.
                        Mr. BROWN desired time to submit a minority report.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The object is to print.
                        Mr. BROWN. Then let the minority report be also printed.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said it was not competent now to consider the bill under the
                            rules.
                        Mr. KILGORE. It is a bill making regulations so as to allow soldiers to
                            vote in the field.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN moved to amend by adding an order to print the minority report
                            when it should be submitted.
                        The vote on the motion to suspend the restriction resulted-yeas 47, nays
                            33-so two-thirds not voting in the affirmative, the House refused to
                            suspend the restriction.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the minority of the committee have further time to
                            report.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH complained that the committee had taken no notice of his
                            bill, No. 102, He said he had offered the bill No. 102 upon that
                            subject, but the Judiciary Committee had failed to
                            report thereon, but are now reporting back No. 137, offered sometime
                            subsequently. Justice demanded that his bill should have been reported
                            upon at the same time.
                        Mr. Brown's motion, for time to submit a minority report, was agreed
                            to.
                    

                    
                        TWENTY SECOND OF FEBRUARY.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the joint special committee on that subject submitted
                            the following:
                        MR. SPEAKER: The joint committee of the two Houses of
                            the General Assembly, to whom was referred the matter of making
                            provision for a celebration of the birth-day of Washington, have had the
                            same under consideration, and in view of the fact neither House was in
                            session on Saturday, and that most of the committee were absent until
                            too late to perfect proper arrangements, they recommend that no steps be
                            taken by the Legislature for a formal celebration. They farther suggest
                            that the best honors they can render to the day will be a faithful
                            attention to the business of legislation now pressing for action.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH moved to concur.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to strike out that part of the report which proposes a
                            lecture to the House.
                        The SPEAKER. (Mr. Henricks in the Chair.) The argument of the committee
                            can hardly be a matter of concurrence. The motion of the gentleman from
                            Jackson can be hardly entertained under the rules.
                        Mr. BROWN then moved to amend the recommendation of the committee by an
                            adjournment in honor of the day.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN moved to lay Mr. Brown's amendment on the table.
                        
                        The yeas and nays thereon resulted--yeas 47, nays 31: so it was laid on
                            the table.
                        The report of the select committee was then concurred in.
                        Mr. RHOADS called for the special order, viz: the consideration of his
                            common school bill, No. 178.
                        Mr. CHURCH moved to postpone this special order for the next, viz: the
                            consideration of the County Boards bill [S. No. 3 ]
                        
                        The motion was agreed to--affirmative 50, negative 27.
                    
                    
                        SCHOOL FUND.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, this order was suspended to receive a report
                            from the Committee on the Sinking Fund.
                        Mr. KILGORE, from the Committee on the Sinking Fund,
                            returned Mr. Newcomb's bill, [H. R. 47,] to increase the power of the
                            Sinking Fund Commissioners, and to authorize said Board to loan any
                            moneys belonging to said fund in Indiana State bonds or stocks, and
                            providing for the canceling of such bonds cr stocks, and the re-issuing
                            of new non-negotiable bonds or stocks payable to said fund, with an
                            amendment filling blanks by inserting "twenty years or sooner, if said
                            Commissioners think proper."
                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, (by unanimous consent,) the bill was passed to
                            the second reading.
                         Mr. DUNHAM said preference should be given to State Stocks in these
                            investments.
                        Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend by inserting "6 per cent, as the interest
                            to be paid on the new bonds."
                        Mr. WRIGHT was in favor of the amendment.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. That amendment would increase the State debt. It would be
                            adding considerable per cent, to the interest. He explained. He was not
                            for increasing the State debt even for the benefit of the school fund.
                            He would rather tax directly for schools. He urged the prompt passage of
                            the bill.
                        Mr. BRANHAM could not see how this would increase the public debt. This
                            bill contemplates a permanent interest of the school fund, and at
                            interest below the legal rate. He had a bill fixing the same rate of
                            interest for them and the war bonds, but had found no time to introduce
                            it. 
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend further: "Provided it shall be the duty of
                            said Board to purchase said bonds, in preference to loaning the fund to
                            individuals, whenever such bonds can be obtained upon satisfactory
                            terms." 
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB explained that the funds shall be invested bearing the same
                            rate of interest as the bonds.
                        Mr. BRANHAM'S amendment was now again submitted.
                        Mr. BROWN. Does the same rate of interest apply to individuals?
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The interest on loans to individuals is not changed--7 per
                            cent.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The object is to invest the common school funds in the
                            stocks of the State. His proposition was that the new bonds shall bear 6
                            per cent. The war bonds bear interest at 6 per cent. Certainly the
                            school fund should not be less favored. 
                        Mr. DUNHAM. The only effect of the amendment was to increase the school
                            fund from the Treasury of the State.
                         Mr. COFFROTH. Was it not indirectly enlarging the indebtedness of the
                            State as much as it would be increasing the two and a half per cent.
                            bonds from about two and a half millions to nearly six millions, by
                            increasing the rate of interest?
                         Mr. BUSKIRK. If this bill passes, of course the Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners would give preference, in purchasing, to the two and a
                            half per cents. He was opposed to the amendment.
                         Mr. BRANHAM. The school fund was only increased by taxation. He
                            explained that the school fund now at seven per cent. did not actually
                            pay as much as 5 per cent.
                        Mr. RHOADS. Where is the State to get the money to pay this interest?
                        Mr BRANHAM. From the general levy.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The effect will work loss to the State and the Sinking Fund,
                            and increase the value of the two and a half per cents.
                        The question was then taken on Mr. Branham's amendment, resulting--yeas
                            34, nays 46--as follows:

                        So the amendment was rejected.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK submitted the following:
                         Section --. That all laws in conflict or inconsistent with the
                            provisions of this act, be and the same are hereby repealed.
                        The amendment was adopted.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill was ordered to the third reading.
                        On the further motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, (the constitutional restriction
                            being suspended for the purpose-yeas 70, nays 7)--the bill was read the
                            third time.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH objected to its making it imperative on the Commissioners to
                            purchase.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB corrected this mistake, and explained further the provisions
                            and the necessity of the bill.
                        Mr. BROWN was for the bill. The fund was not loaned now. It was not safe
                            at this time to loan it on real estate security. If this bill pass, the
                            Commissioners of the Sinking Fund could take up nearly three millions of
                            State bonds now nearly due.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM demanded the previous question, (and there was a second,)
                            and, under its force, the bill was finally passed the House of
                            Representatives--yeas 63, nays 10.
                    
                    
                        COUNTY BONDS.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) now returned to the special
                            order, viz: the consideration of the County Bonds bill [S. No. 3] and pending
                            amendments.
                        Mr. SIM moved to reconsider the vote of yesterday adopting the first
                            section of the minority amendment: Because the passage of the bill was
                            demanded by his constituents; 2dly, because these county bonds were
                            issued in good faith; and, 3dly, because if this bill does not pass,
                            great injustice will be done to the soldiers in the field. Large
                            portions of our men had veteranized. It would be injustice to those men
                            who have these bonds, if this bill does not pass. He had been opposed,
                            in principle, to local bounties. He preferred the operation of the
                            draft. He sometimes felt that he would like himself to pick out the men
                            that should be taken. He should vote against that amendment of the
                            minority, and expected no unpleasant dreams in consequence. He had been
                            a soldier himself, and knew that a very large portion of Indianians in
                            the field were recipients of these bonds. It was true, that these bonds
                            were gotten up for patriotic purposes, but by those subject to the
                            draft, in order to save their own necks. He desired to get rid of this
                            amendment because it would defeat the bill.
                        Mr. BROWN, for the purpose of giving the gentleman the bent fit of his
                            motion to reconsider, withdrew his amendment, which was pending at the
                            time of the adjournment yesterday.
                        Mr. WRIGHT examined the reasons for reconsideration. The gentleman says
                            the amendment will defeat the bill. But where was the injustice of the
                            amendment? There was not a man on the floor but was willing to release
                            the soldier from this tax. This amendment only gives to the soldier the
                            poor privilege of working out his tax. He contended for the equity and
                            justice of the amendment.
                        Mr. SIM. With the amendment, would the gentleman from Jefferson now
                            support this bill?
                        Mr. WRIGHT. No sir. He was opposed to the whole thing. It shut the door
                            of bounty against all who may volunteer under future calls; and it
                            provides not for those who have already served without bounty.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, was for reconsideration, and the passage of this
                            bill. It was demanded by the people. He concurred with Mr. Buskirk's
                            views of the unconstitutionally of the amendment. He was in favor of
                            legalizing the act of these Commissioners, who have acted in good
                            faith.
                        Mr. WRIGHT. Will the gentleman state his objection to the amendment? 
                        
                        Mr. GREGORY. That amendment will increase litigation over the
                            constitutional question. He carried out the well known wish of his
                            constituents in his support of this bill. He was willing to divide all
                            he had to sustain and relieve our patriotic soldiers who have been
                            making a rampart of their bodies to shield the life of the
                            Government.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question, and under its force the vote
                            adopting the first section of the minority amendment, was
                            reconsidered-yeas 51, nays 27.
                        
                        So the vote was reconsidered, and the question recurred again on the
                            adoption of that first division of the minority amendment, it was
                            rejected-yeas 28 nays 52.
                        Hereupon-
                        Mr. GRIFFITH explained his vote. This amendment was eminently proper if
                            we had the power to make it, but upon mature reflection and
                            consultation, he believed the amendment to be unconstitutional. He
                            added: I am in favor of relieving those who stand between us and the
                            enemy from every other burthen, if we can do so legally, and I know that
                            I have the interest of the soldiers at heart as much as the gentleman
                            from Jefferson, but the enemies of the bill tacked on this provision for
                            the purpose of killing the bill and placing their own friends in a false
                            position. I therefore vote in favor of recosidering the vote of
                            yesterday.
                        The question recurred on the adoption of the second branch of the
                            minority amendment, and the yeas and nays being demanded and taken
                            thereon, resulted yeas 21, nays 59--as follows:

                        So that much of the amendment of the minority report was rejected.
                        The question recurred on the amendments reported by the majority of the
                            select committee.
                        Mr. COFFROTH said in these amendments it was proposed to pay these funds
                            in 1, 2 and 3 years. The county boards had not the discretion to levy
                            the whole tax in one year, or to admit of a longer time than three
                            years. He, considered this whole question should be left to the sound
                            discretion of the committees. He proposed to amend that clause, in the
                            first proviso to the second section of the bill, by striking out
                            "one-third," and inserting "one-fourth," and adding the fourth year,
                            "1868," to the time.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question.
                        Mr. HAMRICK wanted more time for deliberation. He had an amendment to
                            offer,which was read for information, to this effect: That no bond or
                            order, issued, &c., and which had been sold at less than par, shall
                            be legalized.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. How will you distinguish between the bonds when you come to
                            legalize them? 
                        Mr. HAMRICK. We will not legalize them at all. [Laughter.]
                        
                        There was a second for the previous question, and then the main question,
                            viz: Shall Mr. Goffroth's amendment be adopted? was decided in the
                            affirmative-yeas 59, nays 19.
                        The question now recurred, (still under the force of the previous
                            question) on the adoption of the majority amendment, submitting a now
                            bill (described in these proceedings last Friday.)
                        
                        Mr. CHAMBERS made an ineffectual motion to adjourn-affirmative 36,
                            negative 36.
                        The yeas and nays taken on the adoption of the majority bill, as amended,
                            resulted--yeas 59, nays 19--as follows:

                                        Wooaruff, and Wright-19.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. WHITESIDE (explaining his vote) said: The part he had taken to get
                            the House to adopt the minority report, was taken in all sincerity. He
                            believed then and now, that that section was perfectly in harmony with
                            the provisions of the Constitution, notwithstanding the considerations
                            taken by learned gentlemen who had differed with them. He would have
                            been glad if that section were adopted, because the refusal to adopt it
                            inflicts a great wrong on the men of five or six companies of the 8th,
                            47th and 75th regiments of Indiana Volunteers. But he would now cast his
                            vote in the affirmative, for this reason: because these bonds were
                            issued in good faith, and have been accepted in good faith, and a large
                            number of them were now in the hands of a large number of soldiers and
                            their families; and he did not want to injure them by any vote that he
                            might cast o this floor.
                        So the substitute reported by the majority of the Select Committee, was
                            adopted; and the question recurred on the final passage or bill [S. No. 3] as amended.
                        
                         Mr. RICE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--affirmative 12, negative
                            51.
                        The yeas and nays on the final passage resulted--yeas 51, nays 21--as
                            follows: 
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Abbett, Atkinson, Banta, Beckett, Bonner, Boyd,
                                        Brown, Buskirk, Chambers, Church, Coffroth, Cox, Crook,

                                        Shoaff, of Allen, Shoaff, of Jay, Shuey, Sim, Stewart,
                                        Stivers, Stringer, Thacher, Trusler, Upson, White and
                                        Willis--51. 
                                    
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Bird, Branham, Emerson, Ferris, Gregory, of
                                        Montgomery, Hamrick, Henricks, Hogate, Hoover, Kilgore,
                                        Lane, Miller, of Clinton, Miller of Tippecanoe, Olleman,
                                        Reese, Rhoads, Richards, Stucky, Woodruff, Woods and
                                        Wright--21. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the title of the bill so as to read to this
                            effect: An act to legalize the issuing of bonds, and the making
                            appropriations and the levy, assessment and collection of taxes, and
                            declaring it to be unlawful, after the present quota shall have been
                            filled, to incur any further indebtedness on this account.
                        The amendment was agreed to; and so the bill passed the House of
                            Representatives.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Considering that, in this vote we have done a good day's
                            work, and that this is the 22d day of February-the birthday of the most
                            distinguished man in the history of our country-a man whose birth we
                            have all celebrated from our earliest recollections, who, while be
                            lived, all the people of his country rose up to honor his deeds and his
                            name, and when be died, the first Napoleon directed his legions to hang
                            black on their banners; as another public expression, therefore, of our
                            appreciation of the character of this great countryman of ours, he moved
                            that when this House adjourns to-day, it shall be till to-morrow morning
                            at 9 o'clock.
                        The motion was agreed to, and then at 1 o'clock P. M-
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, the House adjourned.
                    
                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        THURSDAY, February 23, 1865.
                    
                     The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR called the Senate to order at 9 o'clock A. M.
                     The journal of yesterday's proceedings was being read, when--
                    On motion by Mr. Cason, the further reading thereof was dispensed with. 
                    
                        PETITIONS
                        Were presented by Messrs. WARD, RICHMOND, DOWNEY, CHAPMAN, VAWTER,
                            ENGLISH, HORD, GAFF and HYATT, from citizens of the Whitewater Valley,
                            praying for a law by which a railroad may be constructed on the line of
                            the Whitewater Valley canal, not impairing the present hydraulic power
                            thereof; which were referred to the Committee on Canals and
                                Internal Improvements.
                        Messrs. MILLIGAN and WOODS presented Petitions praying for a law
                            requiring the applicant for license to sell intoxicating liquors, to
                            procure the signature of a majority of the voters of the town thereto
                            before license shall be issued; which were referred to the
                                Committee on Temperance without reading. 
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passage of House bill numbered 8,
                            (see page 271 of BREVIER REPORTS,) and 63, (see p. 83,) and Senate bill
                            numbered 141 and 143, (see p. 165,) and 119 (p. 138,) which latter
                            bill--
                        On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK was read the second time, and--
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, re-committed to the Judiciary
                                Committee.
                    
                    
                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                        Was granted Mr. Niles from to-morrow morning till Monday night.
                    
                    
                        SOLDIERS' RELIEF.
                        The special order for this hour--being the bill H. R. 14--was postponed till 11
                            o'clock this day.
                    
                    
                        COUNTY AND OTHER BONDS.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS, from the select committee thereon, returned the bill AS. 3, with House amendments
                            thereto, (described on page 273 of these reports,) recommending that
                            they be concurred in, with other amendments proposed by the special
                            committee.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS was willing that the people of the several counties shall do
                            as they please in this matter of issuing bonds, but did not want to see
                            another draft take place as it did last fall.
                        Mr. OYLER knew it was popular to talk about the right of the people to
                            govern themselves. They have that right, and he firmly believed is the
                            ability of the people to exercise it. But there is such a thing as the
                            popular mind going crazy on some subjects, and to-day one-half the
                            counties of the State have gone mad on this matter, and it is the duty
                            of the Legislature to lay its hand on and stop this carriage which is
                            running, us down hill to destruction. It is the duty of every loyal man
                            to yield the service demanded of him by the Government. It is because
                            men love their carcasses better than their pockets that they make this
                            pressure bear upon the Legislature. He was opposed to legalizing what
                            the counties have already done on this subject, and insisted that this
                            thing ought to be stopped for all time to come.
                        Mr. BENNETT undertook to say that the greatest evil about this thing
                            arises from the fact of our delay in this matter by which county bonds
                            have been depreciated and bought from the soldier at a great shave by
                            the sharper. The County Commissioners supposed they had the right under
                            the law of 1861 to issue these bonds, and having done so in good faith,
                            at an early day in the session, he introduced this bill to legalize such
                            acts. With other Senators here, he believed the subject of bounties had
                            been carried to an unreasonable extent, and that it ought to be stopped
                            where it is. As an original idea he did not believe in bounties. The
                            proper way to raise soldiers is by a draft, and if the drafted man did
                            not want to go let him hire a substitute. But this is not an original
                            proposition; if is a proposition to meet a debt already created. A large
                            majority of the Soldiers have already received their bounty, and in such
                            cases they are taxed to pay for the debt created in paying them their
                            bounties.
                        Mr. NILES was in favor of prohibiting the issuing of bonds by counties,
                            cities and townships, in the future, and was, therefore, opposed to the
                            amendment of the committee. It did not seem proper to make a factious or
                            futile opposition to what appeared to be a foregone conclusion-the
                            passage of the bill substantially as it came from the House. Yet he
                            regretted it, as full of evil to the State. He was amazed a  the amount of bands which have been issued
                            in some neighborhoods. The aggregate amount in the State is probably not
                            less than fifteen or twenty millions of dollars, and he feared that the
                            indebtedness would bear like an incubus on the people. The county
                            Laporte, and several others, in the north part of the State, have filled
                            their quotas by paying money down, and have created no extraordinary
                            burden of future taxation. He was credibly informed that the bonds of
                            some of the counties are thrown on the market a forty or fifty cents on
                            the dollar; When the war is over, and everything again comes down to a
                            specie basis, produce must fall, for a time below its former prices, and
                            many farmer must find it difficult to pay their taxes an support their
                            families. The worst of it all is that these bonds will chiefly go into
                            the hands of moneyed men and speculators, at a price much below their
                            par value, and our soldier must be taxed to pay for exempting other from
                            liability to serve in the army. 
                        He had confidence in the sober second thought of the people, but it was
                            not safe to entrust the power to create public burdens to the people in
                            their aggregate capacity, under circumstances in which they cannot act
                            calmly and with sufficient consideration. A pure Democracy has never
                            been anything but an organized mob. Except for the provision in our
                            present Constitution forbidding counties to subscribe for stock in
                            corporations, nearly every county in the State would have undertaken to
                            aid the building of some railroad, and would be now, like the county of
                            Knox, groaning under its indebtedness. That county, as is known,
                            struggled for years against such a debt, and finally yielded only to the
                            mandate of the highest judicial tribunal of the country. 
                        These bounty bonds were all issued without authority of law, and if we
                            now legalize these transactions, then, in case of another draft, this
                            example will be followed, in defiance of a positive prohibition, and
                            another Legislature will be called on to legalize another more enormous
                            issue of local bonds. He dreaded the effect of opening such a flood
                            gate. Mr. N. continued at some length.
                        Mr. VAWTER would never vote to limit the power of county commissioners to
                            issue bonds, but he expected to vote for most of the amendments reported
                            from the House.
                        Mr. BRADLEY moved to lay on the table that committee amendment giving
                            authority to county boards to appropriate a sum not exceeding two
                            hundred dollars to the man, viz: Add to the 3d section these words:"For a greater amount in the aggregate than two
                                hundred dollars for each man."
                        
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 25, nays 15.
                        
                        Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion--yeas 16, nays 25--to lay on the
                            table the additional section proposed by the Committee, as follows:
                        SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That all orders and
                            obligations for the purpose aforesaid, made or entered into by any
                            township trustee, and all taxes which have heretofore, or which may
                            hereafter be levied for the payment of such indebtedness, by the
                            Township Trustee, with the approval of the Board of Commissioners of the
                            county, be and the same are legalized, and authorized.
                        This committee amendment was then agreed to.
                        Mr. CULLEN moved to amend so as to strike out so much of section one as
                            legalizes the payment of bounties or moneys to drafted men. We may have
                            the right to appropriate money for the benefit of those liable to draft;
                            but he could not see the justice of the principle which would tax other
                            men for the purpose of relieving a man who owes personal service to the
                            Government.
                        Mr. BEESON hoped the amendment would not prevail, thinking it would work
                            injustice to the several townships of the State, and he cited instances
                            where it would so operate.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the amendment was laid on the table, by yeas
                            33, nays 7. 
                        Mr. DOWNEY moved to amend the 2d section so that the taxes shall not be
                            collected in any township which has, by voluntary contribution or
                            otherwise by its own action, raised its quota of volunteers, and where
                            any such township has raised, in such manner, a part of the number of
                            men required from it, it shall be exempt in that proportion.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the amendment was laid on the table, by yeas
                            22, nays 20--as follows: 
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Beeson, Bennett, Bradley, Cason, Chapman, Cobb,
                                        Corbin, Culver, Douglas, Dunning, Fuller, Gaff, Hanna,
                                        Marshall, Mason, Newlin, Niles, Staggs, Thompson, Vawter,
                                        Ward, Williams--22.
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Barker, Bonham, Bowman, Cullen, Davis, Downey,
                                        Dykes, English, Finch, Hyatt, Jenkins, Milligan, Moore,
                                        Noyes, Oyler, Richmond, Terry, Van Buskirk, Woods,
                                        Wright--20. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the amendment was laid on the table.
                         Mr. RICHMOND wished to see whether Senators are looking to the interests
                            of soldiers or not, and moved to amend by adding the following
                            section:
                        SECTION--It is hereby provided that in all cases of taxes assessed and
                            charged to pay all such debts as are named in this act, on the property
                            of persons who have been or are now in the naval, marine, or military
                            service of the United States in the present war for suppressing the
                            Southern rebellion, or their families or descendants, not including
                            substitutes, or those who have not served one year, or those who
                            received bounties from counties to the amount of three hundred dollars
                            or over, the service of such person so being or having been in the
                            service shall be deemed equal in such taxes; and said taxes shall be
                            satisfied and discharged on the order of the Board of Commissioners of
                            the proper county, or, in vacation of said Board, on the order of the
                            County Auditor.
                         Mr. COBB was satisfied that this amendment would destroy the bill
                            because of its unconstitutionality. He should vote for the amendment
                            were it not that he was sure it was unconstitutional.
                         Mr. CULLEN asked if the amendment was unconstitutional, would it destroy
                            the whole bill?
                        Mr. COBB was not prepared to say it would, but saw no use in voting to
                            tack on an unconstitutional amendment. He read from Supreme Court
                            decisions which fixed him in his conclusions. 
                        Mr. OYLER said that this matter had been submitted to high authority in
                            the State, and was pronounced to be constitutional by that authority. He
                            spoke in favor of the amendment, which he contended was not obnoxious to
                            the objections urged by the gentleman.
                        
                        Mr. WILLIAMS desired to show to our soldiers in the field that we would
                            deal fair and honest with them. If this Legislature does not do justice
                            to them some future Legislature would. He would as willingly vote to
                            exempt soldier's property from taxation as any other man if he could
                            legally do it. He hoped the bill would be passed as near as may be as it
                            came from the House.
                        Mr. THOMPSON concurred in the observations made by the Senator from Knox.
                            He feared that by adding any more amendments after this, the fate of the
                            bill would ba endangered. 
                        Mr. BENNETT, in explanation, said if the House refused to concur in this
                            amendment, he should vote to recede from the amendment. If he thought it
                            was unconstitutional, he should vote against it. But giving the benefits
                            of his doubts on the side of the soldier, he should vote "aye."
                        Mr. STAGGS would vote for the amendment too, if he thought the bill would
                            pass with it, but fearing to endanger the passage of the bill, he should
                            vote "no."
                        Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual motion,--yeas 14, nays 29--to lay the
                            amendment on the table.
                        The amendment was then adopted by yeas 29, nays 12--as follows:
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Bennett, Bonham, Bradley, Cason, Chapman,
                                        Corbin, Cullen, Davis, Downey, Dunning, Dykes, Finch, Hord,
                                        Hyatt, Jenkins, Mason, Milligan, Moore, Niles, Noyes, Oyler,
                                        Richmond, Terry, Thompson, Van Buskirk, Vawter, Ward, Woods,
                                        and Wright--23.
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Barker, Beeson, Bowman, Cobb, Culver, Douglas,
                                        Fuller, Hanna, Marshall, Newlin, Staggs and
                                        Williams--12.
                                
                            
                        
                        So, the amendment was adopted.
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that
                            motion on the table.
                        And then came the recess for dinner.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER, the regular order of business was suspended, and
                            his Morgan and other rebel raids bill, S. 15, (see pages 266, 267, 268,
                            269 and 270 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) was taken up, read the
                            third time, and finally passed by yeas 29, nays 17, as follows:

                                        Gaff, Gifford, Hanna, Hord, Hyatt, Jenkins, Marshall, Mason,
                                        Newlin, Oyler, Staggs, Van Buskirk, Vawter, Ward, Williams
                                        and Wright--29
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Beeson, Bennett, Bonham, Bradley, Brown, of

                                        Milligan, Moore, Niles, Noyes, Richmond, Terry, and
                                        Woods:--17. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the bill passed.

                        
                            WILD GAME.
                            The Committee on Agriculture returned the bill S.
                                174, (see page 283,) recommending its passage. The report was
                                concurred in.
                        
                        
                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                            Was obtained for Mr. Peden on account of sickness.
                        
                        
                            DOG LAW.
                            

                            On motion of Mr. COBB the bill H. R.
                                    8, (described on page 271 of BREVIER REPORTS,)was read the
                                second time, and under a dispensation of the Constitutional
                                provision--yeas 36, nays 8--read the third time, and finally passed,
                                by yeas 37, nays 8.

                        
                        
                            RELIEF OF THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND
                                SEAMEN.
                            

                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the Senate resolved itself into a
                                    Committee of the Whole- Mr. Downey in the
                                Chair-and proceeded to the consideration of the special order for
                                this morning, being the relief bill, H. R. 14--see pages 142, 143,
                                144 and 145 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS--the question being
                                on an amendment to the first section, striking out the word "three"
                                before the word "mills," and inserting in lieu thereof the word
                                "two."
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to lay the pending amendment on the table.
                            Mr. VAWTER withdrew the amendment.
                            The second and third sections of the bill were read and adopted.
                            The fourth section being read-
                            Mr. CORBIN moved to amend by striking out the three last words, viz:
                                "or any substitute."
                            Mr. OYLER made an ineffectual motion to lay the amendment on the
                                table.
                            Mr. CORBIN believed there was manifest injustice in excluding from
                                the benefits of this bill the families of substitutes; and for this
                                reason he had offered the amendment.
                            Mr. BENNETT was willing to vote for the amendment.
                             Mr. OYLER insisted that this bill is for the benefit of soldiers'
                                families-for the benefit of patriot soldiers' families-and not for
                                the benefit of the families of those who go in the service out of
                                mercenary motives. He was not willing that the benefits of this bill
                                shall extend to the families of substitutes, for the reason that it
                                is to be supposed such an one will have sufficient funds at home to
                                keep his family till he comes back.
                            Mr. ALLISON understood that the object of the bill was to protect
                                from suffering the families of those serving in our armies, and was
                                not for the benefit of the drafted man, the volunteer or the
                                substitute. It would be unjust and unfair to make any invidious
                                distinctions between the families of those who are fighting our
                                country's battles.
                            Mr. THOMPSON did not know of a more worthy class than are these
                                substitutes-many of whom are war-worn veterans, and he could not see
                                the propriety of making distinctions between the families of men who
                                go to war as substitutes or those who receive bounties for going.
                                There was a barbarity in the idea that he could not tolerate.
                            
                            The amendment was agreed to-affirmative 34, negative not counted.
                            Section 4, as amended, was adopted.
                            Sections 5 and 6 were adopted.
                            Section 7 being read-
                            Mr. CULLEN moved to amend so as to prohibit persons who receive
                                pensions from the General Government from enjoying the benefits of
                                the provisions of this bill.
                            On motion by Mr. CASON, the amendment was laid on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. WOODS, the section was amended by adding the words
                                "and if the said  child be
                                motherless, four dollars per month.
                            "Section 7, as amended, was adopted.
                            Section 8 being read--
                            On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the section was amended "so as to require
                                the Township Trustee, as the disbursing officer of said fund, to
                                give bond to the acceptance of the County Commissioners in the sum
                                of double the amount! which may come into his hands." 
                            Section 8, as amended, was adopted, 
                            Section 9 was adopted.
                             Section 10 being read--
                            Mr. CORBIN moved to strike out all in the section after the word
                                "act" in the sixth line, [Giving the Governor authority to appoint
                                one or more citizens in any county to act in the place of the County
                                Commissioners in carrying out the provisions of this act.] The
                                placing of that power in the hands of the Governor is certainly
                                impracticable. The authority is very great. He opposed the idea of
                                entirely ignoring the home law-making power, but favored the idea of
                                keeping that power as near the people as possible. This provision of
                                the resolution wag going entirely too far.
                            Mr. OYLER opposed the amendment, contending that it does not affect
                                the good man, the honest man-the man who pays due regard to his
                                oath.
                            Mr. BRADLEY favored the amendment.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend the amendment by striking out the whole
                                section. It is going a good way to presume that County Commissioners
                                will not obey the laws of the land.
                            Mr. RICHMOND moved to lay the amendment and the amendment to the
                                amendment on the table.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS withdrew his amendment.
                            
                            The committee refused to lay the amendment [Mr. Corbins,] on the
                                table upon a division--yeas 15, nays 21.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to substitute the words "Judge of the Circuit
                                Court" in place of the word "Governor."
                            On motion of Mr. BROWN, of Wells, this amendment was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. NILES moved to reconsider the vote by which the committee refused
                                to lay the amendment [Mr. Corbin's,] on the table.
                            Mr. HORD was of the opinion that the whole section should be stricken
                                out. Let this power remain where other matters of this kind are
                                usually vested.
                            Mr. DUNNING could see no evils that would result from leaving this
                                section in the bill.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. COBB the motion to reconsider was laid on the table,
                                upon a division, affirmative 23, negative 20.
                            The amendment [Mr. Corbin's,] was agreed to upon a
                                division--affirmative 22, negative 21.
                            On motion of Mr. CULLEN, section 10 was amended by adding thereto
                                these words: "And said person or persons so appointed by the
                                commissioners shall give bond as required of said .trustee in
                                section 8 of this act."Section 10 as amended was adopted.
                            Section 11 was adopted.
                            Section 12 being read--
                            Mr. CORBIN moved to strike out of the section all allowing the
                                Commissioners to borrow money in anticipation of the revenue to be
                                derived from the tax levied by this bill. His objection was the
                                mixing of the various funds belonging to the county with this fund.
                                The tax might never be collected, and there were a great many other
                                ways in which trouble may ensue.
                            Mr. OYLER thought we might as well have no bill at all, as far as the
                                relief of suffering is concerned for at least one year, for it is
                                evident that the taxes levied under this bill cannot be collected in
                                less than that time.
                            On motion by Mr. BRADLEY, the amendment was laid on the table.
                            Mr. OYLER moved to insert the words "and required," before the words
                                "borrow."
                            Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual motion to lay this amendment on the
                                table.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, was of opinion that there is no necessity for
                                these words in the bill. Indeed, his county did not desire this
                                bill. They would take care of soldiers' families, without any
                                statute on the subject. He was opposed to requiring County
                                Commissioners to do what their own feelings of humanity would
                                necessarily lead them to do.
                            Mr. OYLER wished to make this law imperative, and consequently urged
                                upon the committee the advantages of the proposed amendment.
                            Mr. CORBIN regarded it as an insult to County Commissioners, to
                                insert these words, and for that reason he opposed the
                                amendment.
                            The amendment was agreed to upon a division--affirmative 26, negative
                                not counted.
                            Section 12, as amended, was adopted.
                            Sections 13, 14, 15 and 16 were adopted.
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the vote by which section 10 was adopted,
                                was reconsidered.
                             On motion by Mr. BENNETT, section 10 was stricken out upon a
                                division-affirmative 20, negative 18.
                            Mr. OYLER moved to amend by adding the following section:
                            SECTION--. "That the act, entitled An Act to authorize the Boards of
                                Commissioners of the several counties in the State of Indiana, and
                                the authorities of any incorporated city or town in said State to
                                make appropriations in certain cases, and to legalize certain
                                appropriations therein specified," approved May 11,1861, be and the
                                same is hereby repealed, provided that the Boards of County
                                Commissioners, and the corporate authorities of cities and towns,
                                may in their discretion distribute any and all provisions, wood or
                                other stores, purchased or provided by such authorities for the
                                relief and protection of the families of soldiers, to such families. 
                            On motion by Mr. CULVER, the amendment was laid on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the committee reconsidered the vote by which
                                section 9 adopted.
                            Mr. CULLEN moved to amend by out the words, "on the first Tuesday in
                                April," and inserting in lieu thereof the words, "last Monday in
                                March." 
                            Mr. CASON opposed the amendment, and on his motion it was laid on the
                                table.
                            On motion by Mr. HORD, the section was amended by inserting after the
                                time the bill fixes, these words: "And as many times as the board of
                                commissioners may require."
                            Section 9, as amended, was adopted.
                            
                            Section 17 was adopted.
                            Mr. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR moved that the committee recommend to the
                                Senate to strike out that portion of the bill which makes
                                discrimination between citizens of the State.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN made an ineffectual motion to lay this motion on the
                                table.
                            The motion was then agreed to.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to reconsider the vote by which section 1 was
                                adopted, that he might move to make the basis of this bill on the
                                needy soldiers.
                            On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                table.
                            On motion by Mr. HORD the committee rose and reported progress.
                            The report was concurred in, except the part striking out the 10th
                                section, and the recommendation concerning discriminations.
                            The Senate refused to concur in the amendment of the
                                    Committee of the Whole, striking out section
                                10, by yeas 23, nays 24--the Lieutenant Governor voting in the
                                negative--as follows:

                                            Richmond, Terry, Thompson, Van Buskirk, Ward, Woods and
                                            Mr. President--24.
                                    
                                
                            
                            So the Senate refused to concur in the amendment of the
                                    Committee of the Whole, striking out section
                                10.
                            The recommendation of the Committee of the Whole
                                to reconsider the vote by which the Senate struck from the House
                                bill the words printed below, as proposed by the Committee on
                                Finance, was concurred in by yeas 31, nays 14.
                            So the vote was reconsidered.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                            The question then recurring on agreeing to the amendment proposed by
                                the Committee on Finance, striking out the
                                following words from the House bill:
                            "Who have not otherwise sufficient means for their comfortable
                                support, such fact to be determined by the disbursing officer, but
                                any applicant dissatisfied with the decision may refer the same to
                                the board of county commissioners, whose determination shall be
                                final."
                            
                            The amendment was rejected by yeas 14, nays 30.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.

                        THURDSAY, February 23, 1865.
                    
                    The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    Mr. BRANHAM moved to dispense with the reading of the journal of
                        yesterday.
                    Mr. SPENCER and Mr. WHITESIDE asked and obtained leave to record their votes
                        in the affirmative on the final passage, which was taken yesterday, of the
                        County Bonds bill, [S. No. 3.]
                    Mr. GOODMAN, Mr. HUMPHREYS, Mr. MONTGOMERY, Mr. HERSHEY, Mr. MEREDITH and Mr.
                        GROVES, had leave to record their votes in the negative on the passage of
                        said bill.

                        Whereupon a question of fact as to what transpired in committee, arose

                            stating that the only change in the law of fees proposed by the bill was

                        The SPEAKER held, that the point of order is not well taken.
                        Mr. SHUEY' S motion to print 300 copies was then agreed to.

                        On the motion of Mr. RHOADS, his common school bill No. 178, to provide for a general
                            system of common schools, the officers thereof and their respective
                            powers and duties, and matters properly connected therewith, and for the
                            establishment and regulation of township libraries, and to repeal all
                            laws inconsistent therewith was taken up it being the special order.
                        Mr. RHOADS made an ineffectual motion to suspend the Constitutional
                            restriction, and read the bill the second time by title yeas 46, nays 33
                            two-thirds, not voting in the affirmative. 
                        Whereupon, by direction of the SPEAKER, (Mr. Woods in the Chair,) the
                            Clerk proceeded to read the bill the second time.
                        Pending the reading of the bill-
                        Mr. BROWN rose, he said, to a question of privilege, and submitted on
                            behalf of the minority of the special committee on Mr. Branham's
                            soldiers' vote bill, No. 137, a paper respectfully alleging that the
                            House has rescinded the order granting leave of time for a minority
                            report, before the minority has had time to report; and thereupon they
                            return the bill, in obedience to the order of the House, having no
                            report to make thereon. Signed, John R. Coffroth, Jason B. Brown.
                        Mr. BOYD moved, with all due respect to the gentleman submitting the
                            paper, that the report be rejected.
                        The SPEAKER (resuming the chair) decided that the report was not a
                            question of privilege, and that the papers would go to the Clerk's files
                            without order. The reading of a proposition could not be suspended for
                            any motion.
                        After debate on this order by Messrs. COFFROTH, DUNHAM, BOYD, and others,
                            the matter was passed without action, and the reading of the common
                            school bill proceeded till it was concluded.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the school bill, No. 178, be now
                                        considered by sections for the purposes of amendment and
                                        correction, and the adoption of such sections as may require
                                        no amendment or correction.
                                
                            
                        
                        The SPEAKER. The chair called attention to the 1st and 132d sections of
                            the bill authorizing a tax, which should be considered in
                                Committee of the Whole.
                        Mr. GREGORY was willing to modify his order accordingly.
                        Mr. BRANHAM suggested that only the section relating to taxation be
                            considered in Committee of the Whole.
                        Mr. Gregory's order was then agreed to.
                        On motion by Mr. RHOADS, the bill was then referred to the
                                Committee of the Whole.
                        The SPEAKER announced the special committee, on the bill No. 108. viz:
                            Messrs, Whiteside, Abbett, Wright, Beckett, and Church.
                        Mr. BRANHAM asked for unanimous consent for a motion to take up the
                            general appropriation bill.
                        But, objection being made--
                        On motion of Mr. SPENCER, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock. 
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION.

                        
                            SOLDIERS' VOTE BILL.
                            The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of Mr. Branham's
                                Soldiers' vote bill, No, 1st, as amended by the Committee
                                    on the Judiciary. [A new bill. Soldiers absent in the
                                field or hospital may vote by proxy.]
                            The bill was read through by the Clerk, together with the
                                substitute.
                            Mr. KILGORE moved that the amendment be concurred in.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK preferred to make it a special order. There was an order
                                to print the bill and amendments, and we had not yet the printed
                                copies.
                            
                             Mr. NEWCOMB. The substitute amendment would be ready this
                                afternoon.
                            The subject was then made the special order for to-morrow 2 o'clock.
                            
                        
                        
                            GOVERNOR'S HOUSE.
                            

                             On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the Governor's House bill, [S. No. 41] was taken up, the
                                question being on ordering to engrossment and third reading.
                            
                            It was ordered to the third reading--affirmative 47, negative 29.
                            
                            The bill was then read the third time, and passed the House--yeas 59,
                                nays 28.
                        
                        
                            COMMON SCHOOLS.
                            On motion by Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, the House resolved itself into
                                    Committee of the Whole--Mr. Buskirk in the
                                Chair--and took up the special order, viz,: Mr. Rhoad's Common
                                School bill No. 178.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the sections of the bill were called for
                                the clerks numerically.
                            The clerk announced the first section.
                            Mr. HARRISON proposed to amend in line 3 of first section, by
                                striking out from the tax clause "one-fifth of one per cent.," ad
                                valorem, and inserting in lieu "one-tenth," &c.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. proposed to amend the amendment by inserting
                                "one-eighth"so making the tax 12 1/2 cents on the $ 100.
                            Mr. SPENCER. The aggregate of the poll tax, as proposed by this bill
                                to be increased, would make it only about $3.50 to the poll. If we
                                have got to be taxed, let it come. He was opposed to the
                                amendments.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. It was impossible to improve the schools,
                                without means. The present school law did not admit of but three
                                months school in the year. He was in favor of raising the standard
                                of education-a ten cents or a twelve cents tax would not answer. He
                                would have the common schools taught for at least six months in the
                                year. When the term was but three months, the schools were overrun,
                                with too many pressing into them and spoiling their efficiency. He
                                submitted general considerations which should induce legislation for
                                the encouragement of schools-going even in advance of the public
                                demand. He referred to Indianapolis and Terre Haute memorialists
                                ready to pay twenty cents on the one hundred dollars for the support
                                of common schools. All the friends of education were in favor of
                                this two mills tax.
                            Mr. BRANHAM claimed to ba as good a friend of education as any man on
                                the floor. Does not the bill change the age from which you begin to
                                enumerate school children, from five to six years? Be was answered
                                in the affirmative. Then this would increase the amount to each
                                scholar.
                            Mr. OLLEMAN. There was no provision in the bill to exclude younger
                                children.
                            Mr. BRANHAM asked sundry questions with reference to the committee's
                                estimates for school revenue-his object being to show that it is
                                competent to teach six months in the year, if we recognize our
                                present means. He gave estimates himself, based on statements in the
                                report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, showing that the
                                school revenue could be increased to at least $357,000, without
                                burthening the people with any further tax. He thought the increase
                                would go to $400,000. Then limit the admission of scholars to seven
                                years-let us have a system of just economy and when that fails let
                                the schools come in and ask for an increase of means.
                            After debate on the applicability of the ten minutes restriction in
                                    Committee of the Whole, in which Messrs.
                                Coffroth, Brown, Lasselle, Henricks and others participated
                            The CHAIRMAN held that the ten minutes rule is applicable to
                                proceedings in Committee of the Whole.
                            Mr. BRANHAM proceeded by unanimous consent. He doubted not that the
                                people would promptly respond to needful taxes. The State had
                                doubled, and the counties would treble their taxes; and this
                                suggested a rigid public economy. With regard to raising teachers'
                                salaries, he suggested the economy of employing female teachers, and
                                consolidating the schools in summer. A half mill tax was all the
                                friends of education should ask. Upon the close of the war the
                                currency would be called in and prices would go back to the old
                                standard. We could increase the school revenue $400,000. And if
                                $800,000 taught the schools three months last year, might not
                                $1,200,000 or $1,300,000 teach them for six months of the year?
                            Mr. RHOADS. We must have schools for a certain length of time-say
                                eight months of the year. The next point was to raise the necessary
                                funds. He showed, from the report of the Superintendent of Public
                                Instruction, that the school revenue, for the last two years, had
                                sufficed to maintain the schools between three and four months of
                                the year. He started with the estimate for schools to be taught
                                eight months in the year; and the cost, of that, as the
                                Superintendent of Public Instruction estimates, would be $1,789,452.
                                The Superintendent gives an estimate of the school revenue from all
                                sources, $1610,686. He showed an error in the latter estimate on
                                account of revenue from the liquor law, making it something less. 
                            Did we need school for eight months ? Then we must take this tax of
                                two mills on the dollar for all the taxable property in the State.
                                The consolidation of schools, as suggested by Mr. Branham, was
                                impossible. The people desired eight months schools in all the
                                counties in his region. In some places they were even clamorous for
                                schools for nine or ten months of the year. This was a question of
                                more pressing urgency and importance in the towns and cities, than
                                in the rural districts. But gentlemen regarded this as an enormous
                                taxation. Massachusetts was now paying $6 a scholar. It would take
                                40 cents on the $100 to bring Indiana to the Massachusetts
                                standard.
                            He showed that the States on either side of us were ahead of the
                                State of Indiana in the weight of school tax which they paid. He
                                gave considerations of the importance of this question. There had
                                been no increase in school teachers' wages, whilst wages in other
                                departments of service had been greatly advanced; and unless we
                                raise the price, we can not command the requisite talent. Our school
                                system, as it had been provided for hertofore,  was little better than it had been
                                denominated,a system for educating paupers. The standard must be
                                raised by raising the compensation of teachers. These Considerations
                                made this 20 cents tax indispensable.
                            Mr. HARRISON stated the question. With the explanation of Mr.
                                Newcomb, he did not except his amendment. His own amendment made it
                                10 cents on the $100-just the old law. Pass this bill, and the
                                amount of the tax on the individual poll would be $3 20. He would be
                                if we could increase the school revenue, but could not see how it
                                could be done prudently. It was not reason to ask that it should be
                                increased at this time 
                            The CHAIRMAN (being satisfied that there was misprint in the rules,)
                                now held that speech is not restricted in Committee of the
                                    Whole.
                            Mr. BRANHAM suggested 15 cents on the $100, to accommodate
                                conflicting views.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB accepted that as his amendment.
                            The first question was on Mr. Newcomb's amendment, fixing the tax at
                                15 cents.
                            
                            It was rejected--affirmative 29, negative 51.
                            
                            Mr. HARRISON'S amendment, fixing the tax at 10 cents on the $100 was
                                rejected--affirmative 33, negative 47.
                            
                            The next question was on the adoption of Mr. Harrison's motion to fix
                                the poll tax at 50 cents, which was agreed to--affirmative 45,
                                negative 32.
                            Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, proposed to make the tax 12 1/2 cents on the
                                $100.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed 16 cents.
                            Mr. RHOADS appealed to the friends of a 20 cents tax to vote against
                                all amendments.
                            Mr. GROVES deprecated any attempt, to largely increase this tax. He
                                would be satisfied with the proposition of the gentleman from
                                Jay.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said, if we could vote 30 cents to feed the
                                children of war-families, we certainly should not withhold 20 cents
                                to educate them.
                            Mr. SPENCER treated the whole thing as a farce. What we wanted was a
                                just administration of the present law.
                            Mr. STEWARD spoke in favor of maintaining the schools eight months of
                                the year; but he advised caution in these proceedings on this bill,
                                and urged an accommodation of views.
                            Mr. CHAMBERS regarded this as a question of economy-the question of
                                educating the people. He averaged the tax at $10 to the tax payer;
                                and, under the private school system, $10 would not school their
                                children more than 3 months. This bill would give them eight months
                                of the year. He considered the distinction between productive and
                                unproductive taxation--this was of the former class.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved to strike out the 20 cents in the first section. He
                                desired to test the sense of the Committee.
                            The CHAIRMAN entertained the motion by consent.
                            Mr. McVEY was willing to vote for the 20 cents. He understood that it
                                was demanded by the people. War might not be necessary, but
                                education is necessary. He referred to the disparaging proportion of
                                the people of the State that can neither read nor write, and if we
                                would not increase that proportion, we should vote for this tax.
                            Mr. CHURCH was satisfied that this tax was economy--taking a similar
                                view with that of Mr. Chambers. Poor men sometimes had the most
                                children. He did not decide whether that was just or not, but he
                                considered it just and equal to tax property to educate the people.
                                He was in favor of a tax and a law that would make our schools worth
                                something.
                            Mr. LOCKHART was willing, to go as high as any man for this tax.
                            Mr. MILROY demanded the previous question. [Laughter.]
                            The CHAIRMAN. There is no previous question in Committee of
                                    the Whole.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. If we have not provided funds enough, we should have
                                more-means that will command the services of competent teachers.
                                Money was abundant now. It was made by steam. He would prefer fifty
                                cents on the $100. He should vote in favor of striking out, so that
                                we may get some larger amount.
                            
                            Mr. BRANHAM'S motion to strike out twenty cents was agreed
                                to--affirmative 43, negative 39.
                            Mr. COFFROTH now proposed to insert fifty cents.
                            Mr. RHOADS proposed twenty-five cents.
                            Mr. ABBETT proposed sixteen cents.
                            Mr. COFFROTH'S amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. COFFROTH now ineffectually proposed forty cents and thirty
                                cents.
                            Mr. RHOADS'S amendment twenty-five cents was rejected.
                            Mr. HAMRICK proposed eighteen cents.
                            Mr. HOOVER proposed nineteen and three-fourth cents.
                            
                            Mr. SIM moved to reconsider the vote, striking cut twenty cents:
                                which was rejected--affirmative 40, negative 42.
                            Mr. HOOVER'S amendment was rejected.
                            
                            Mr. RHOADS proposed nineteen cents: which was rejected--affirmative
                                40, negative 43.
                            Mr. COFFROTH proposed twenty-four cents: which was rejected.
                            
                            Mr. Hamrick's amendment-18 cents, was agreed to--affirmative 43,
                                negative 41.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, desired to move that the committee rise
                                and report the bill to the House.
                            Mr. WRIGHT moved to reconsider the vote by which the poll tax, "one
                                dollar," was stricken out and "50 cents" inserted in lieu.
                            
                            The motion, was rejected--affirmative 37, negative 42.
                            Mr. RHOADS called the attention of the committee to the fact, that
                                sections 1 and 132 were the only sections in the bill authorizing
                                taxation.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the 3d section by striking out that
                                portion which makes the counties liable for the interest of the
                                funds in their hands, whether loaned or not.
                            Mr. McVEY said that was a requirement of the Constitution.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB said the gentleman's constitutional view was too broadly
                                taken.
                            Mr. McVEY. The reading of the Constitution was exceedingly plain.
                            Mr. Newcomb's amendment was rejected.
                            
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend section 5, by adding a provision to
                                admit of three school trustees for cities.
                            Mr. CHAMBERS proposed to include in the amendment "incorporated
                                towns," which was agreed to:
                            And then, Mr. Newcomb's amendment as amended, was agreed to.
                            Mr. RHOADS proposed to amend section five by striking out "the
                                authorities of such incorporated towns and cities," and insert "the
                                County Commissioners," which was rejected.
                            Mr. FERRIS proposed to substitute new matter for the 5th section, so
                                as to make all the Trustees elective at the same time.
                            Mr. SIM advised that the committee rise, and that the bill go back to
                                the Committee on Education.
                            Mr. STIVERS and Mr. WOODS considered that the original section was
                                right.
                            Mr. HAMRICK moved that the committee rise and report the bill to the
                                House, and ask to be discharged from its further consideration.
                            Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, moved ineffectually to have leave to sit
                                again.
                            And then the committee refused to rise.
                            Mr. FERRIS'S amendment was then rejected.
                            Mr. SPENCER made an ineffectual motion to amend, by inserting, "towns
                                and townships."
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved to pass over the intervening
                                sections and consider section 132.
                            
                            The motion was rejected--affirmative 32, negative 39.
                            Mr. FERRIS proposed to amend section 9; "abstract" shall be
                                published.
                            Mr. HIGGINS moved to strike out the entire section.
                            It was agreed to.
                            Mr. COFFROTH showed a discrepancy between the 1st and 10th
                                sections-the latter section admitting all children, without
                                discriminating against negroes. He would cure that by appropriately
                                inserting the word "white."
                            Mr. WOODS spoke against the amendment. The black men had acted too
                                loyally in this war for their children to be kicked from the common
                                schools.
                            Mr. COFFROTH would not disturb the gentleman's equanimity, and
                                obtained leave to withdraw his amendment for the time being.
                            Mr. KILGORE moved that the committee rise and report the bill to the
                                House as amended.
                            Mr. LASSELLE moved to amend the motion so as to ask leave to sit
                                again.
                            Mr. BRANHAM was in favor of Mr. Kilgore's motion. We should soon get
                                the bill into such a shape that its friends would not have it.
                            Mr. KILGORE inquired whether we would have to go into committee again
                                on the other revenue section.
                            The CHAIRMAN held that if there was any other section levying a tax,
                                it would have to be considered in Committee of the
                                    Whole.
                            Mr. KILGORE then withdrew his motion to rise.
                             On motion by Mr. RHOADS, the committee proceeded to the
                                consideration of section 132.
                            Mr. STRINGER proposed to amend by striking out the section.
                            
                            The section was stricken out--affirmative 41, negative 28.
                            On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the committee now rose, and--
                            The CHAIRMAN reported the bill to the House, as amended, asking
                                concurrence in the amendments, and that the Committee be discharged
                                from the further consideration of the subject.
                            The report lies on the table.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved an order for a night session at 7 1/2 o'clock.
                            Mr. OLLEHAN proposed to amend the motion by fixing the time of
                                meeting at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning.
                            It was rejected.
                            Mr. HOOVER, by unanimous consent, submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the daily sessions of
                                            this House shall hereafter commence at 8 o'clock A. M.,
                                            and at 1 1/2 o'clock and 7 o'clock P. M.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                            Mr. BRANHAM'S order for a 7 1/2 o'clock session was
                                rejected--affirmative 36, negative 41.
                            And then--at 6:10 P. M.--
                            On motion by Mr. HAMRICK, the House adjourned till to-morrow morning
                                at 9 o'clock.
                        
                    

                
                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         FRIDAY, February 24, 1865.

                    On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    
                        CLERK FOR A COMMITTEE.
                        On motion by Mr. WARD the Joint Committee on
                                Corporations were authorized to employ a clerk to date

                        MILITARY AUDITING COMMITTEE.
                        Mr. BENNETT offered a concurrent resolution identical with the one
                            offered in the House of Representatives Tuesday morning and printed on
                            page 288 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING the concurrent resolution was referred to a
                            select committee of 3 which the Lieutenant Governor makes to consist of
                            Messrs. Bennett, Dunning and Cobb.
                    
                    
                        MORRISON AND RAY.
                        Mr. DUNNING presented a communication from Ex-Governor Wright concerning
                            a claim of Morrison and Ray for legal services, which was referred to
                            the Committee on Claims

                            (described on page 138 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) increasing the
                            fees and salaries of Judges, with a report recommending its passage.

                                        Vawter, Williams--22. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        THE STATE PRINTING.
                        Mr. THOMPSON, from the Committee on Printing reported
                            back the bill S. 169, (decribed on page 248 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                            REPORTS,) recommending its passage. 
                        Mr. HORD moved to recommit the bill, with the following instructions:
                         That it be so amended as to pay J. J. Bingham, the former State Printer
                            at the same rates provided in the bill for all printing done by him as
                            such State printer for the past two years.
                         After debate thereon--
                        
                         On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the motion to recommit was laid on the table
                            by yeas 26, nays 17. 
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to recommit, with instructions to inquire into
                            the propriety of amending so as to provide for the payment of J. J.
                            Bingham at the same rates, for work done by him as State Printer during
                            the past two years.
                        After debate thereon, Mr. BROWN, of Wells, withdrew his motion to
                            recommit.
                        
                        The Senate then refused to concur in the committees report, by yeas 15,
                            nays 30.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. COBB, the bill was indefinitely postponed, by yeas 27,
                            nays 19.

                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the bill S.
                                20, (see page 38 of these Reports,) was read the third time
                            and passed by yeas 29, nays 16 as follows:

                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Allison, Bennett, Bonham, Brown, of Hamilton,
                                        Brown, of Wells, Cason, Cobb, Cullen, Davis, Douglas,
                                        Dunning, Dykes, Gaff, Gifford, Hanna, Hord, Marshall, Mason,
                                        Newlin, Noyes, Oyler, Richmond, Staggs, Terry, Thompson, Van
                                        Buskirk, Vawter, Ward, and Wright--29.
                                    NAYS--Messrs, Barker, Beeson, Bowman, Bradley, Chapman,

                        So the bill passed.
                    
                    
                        WHITE WATER VALLEY CANAL.
                        Leave being granted, Messrs. RICHMOND, CHAPMAN, OYLER, BROWN, of
                            Hamilton, CULVER, BONHAM, FULLER and CORBIN presented remonstrances
                            against the passage of a bill diverting the White Water Valley Canal
                            from its present purposes; which were referred to the Committee
                                on Canals and Internal Improvements.
                        Subsequently Messrs. COBB, VAN BUSKIRK, BOWMAN, DOUGLAS, NEWLIN and
                            MILLIGAN presented petitions in favor of such a bill; which took the
                            same reference.
                    
                    
                        THE SUPREME AUTHORITY.
                        Mr. OYLER submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT--The Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges of the inhabitants of the State, to whom was
                            referred [recited on page 257 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,] a
                            proposed amendment to the Constitution of the State, and to request our
                            Representatives, and instruct our Senators to use their influence to
                            have the same amendments incorporated into the Constitution of the
                            United States, said proposed amendments acknowledging Almighty God as
                            the source of all authority and power in civil governments, the Lord
                            Jesus Christ as the Ruler among the Nations, and His revealed will as of
                            Supreme authority, have had the same under consideration, and have
                            instructed me to report thereon: First, As regards our State
                            Constitution, the recognition of the Great Creator is full and ample in
                            the preamble; and that as a general principle, the Christian religion
                            has as full and complete a recognition in our laws, both primary and
                            secondary, as is practicable or desirable. While your committee are of
                            the opinion that it might be for the best for all the people to be
                            Christian in faith and in practice they cannot lose sight of the great
                            truth, that such is not the fact, and that the lights of conscience and
                            of faith, are rights which are not, and of right ought not to be
                            restrained, coerced, or imperiled by human legislators; that these
                            rights are above and beyond the dictum or arbitrations of human law, and
                            that for the use, or even the abuse, of them, the individual is
                            responsible to God alone ; that while our Government, both State and
                            National, is both in theory and in fact Christian, and known as such in
                            all the world ; there are thousands upon thousands of citizens of the
                            State and Nation that are not Christians, and in all human probability
                            the proposed change would not, in any degree, tend to aid or assist
                            their conversion or change of faith, however desirable such change may
                            be; and it must be remembered that all of this class or classes have the
                            same inalienable rights, by the endowment of the great Creator; that the
                            genius and spirit of our institutions absolutely forbid any and all
                            interference, either direct or indirect, with these God given rights,
                            upon, principle, and in addition to this fact, it is the lesson of
                            experience, that it is a very doubtful question if the cause of pure
                            religion ever was, or in the nature and fitness of things, ever can be
                            properly advanced, by connecting and wedding it to and with the civil
                            government. A union of Church and State is full of un-mixed evil to both
                            organizations; granulizing and destructive of the highest and greatest
                            good of both; and as a consequence, to be deplored, and as far as no may
                            be, to be prevented. There ought not to be, of light, any other
                            qualification for office in a free people, than that of citizenship and
                            a freedom from crime; and errors of faith are not crimes, and of right
                            ought not to be made so by human enactment. Civil and religious liberty
                            are the safeguards of individual liberty, harmonious and competent to
                            effect the end arrived at in human government, while moving and
                            operating in their appropriate spheres, but crippled and hindered
                            whenever and wherever they are improperly joined together.
                        Your Committee are of opinion that any legislation upon the subject is
                            unwise and inexpedient, and they ask to be discharged from any further
                            consideration of the subject.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        OFFICIAL OVERCHARGING.
                        Mr. RICHMOND, from the Committee on County and Township
                                Business, returned the bill, S. 161--see page 225 of these
                            Exports--recommending its passage.
                         The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        WHITEWATER VALLEY CANAL.
                        Leave being granted, Mr. VAN BUSKIRK offered the following:
                        
                            
                                

                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Canals and Internal Improvements, to whom was
                                        referred House Bill No. 59, be discharged from the further
                                        consideration of said bill, and that they are hereby
                                        respectfully requested to return the same to the Senate at
                                        once.
                                
                            
                        
                        Messrs. BENNETT and BROWN, of Wells, without committing themselves for or
                            against the bill, objected to the passage of the resolution.
                        Mr. CULLEN regarded the resolution as an insult to the Committee
                                on Canals and Internal Improvements; and looking upon it
                            in that light, as chairman of the committee, repelled it in unmeasured
                            terms.
                        
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK disclaimed most positively any intention of discourtesy,
                            either to the Committee or to any Senator on the floor; and insisted
                            that this action was parliamentary and of frequent occurrence in
                            deliberative bodies.
                        Mr. BEESON regarded the resolution as impugning the motives of the
                            committee, and as going a little too far. In all his legislative
                            experience he never saw an outside pressure equal to that now being made
                            in favor of this bill, and he hoped Senators would act without reference
                            to this pressure.
                        Mr. CORBIN insisted there could be no good reason shown to justify the
                            course now being taken; and hoped a due sense of respect for members of
                            the committee would deter the Senate from adopting the resolution.
                        
                        Mr. BRADLEY, made an ineffectual motion--yeas 21, nays 24--to lay the

                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the motion out of order.
                         Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate.
                        Pending which--
                        Mr. BENNETT asked, but failed to obtain, leave of absence for Mr. Cullen,
                            and-
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, farther proceedings under the call were dispensed

                         The question being "Shall the main question be now put?"-
                        It was so ordered by yeas 32, nays 10.

                        Pending the roll call--
                        Messrs. Bsnnett, Chapman, Richmond, Oyler and Cullen, asked but failed to
                            obtain leave to be excused from voting.
                        So the resolution was adopted.
                        Mr. HANNA moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay that motion
                            on the table.

                            to be excused from voting.
                         Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate.
                         It was ordered, and being taken discovered the fact that nine Senators
                            were absent.

                            absence.
                        Mr. BENNETT moved that the absentees be sent for.

                        Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,

                        STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.
                        

                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the special committee on Mr. Hogate's Agricultural
                            State Board bill, No. 20, [see p.
                            64 of these Reports,] with amendments. In the 31 section striking out
                            and inserting a clause that the State Treasurer shall refund the tax to
                            said Board, and striking out the 4th section, which was to provide an
                            annual appropriation of $2,000 for the Board.
                        Mr. HAMRICK. The friends of the bill had reluctantly agreed to the
                            striking out of that portion of the bill which appropriates $2,000
                            annually to the State Board. He was surprised at the opposition which
                            made this a prudent course. He referred to the difficulties of the State
                            Board-the military having possession of their grounds-and they had yet
                            received but one year's rent. He wag surprised that the State of Indiana
                            gave no more encouragement to the interests of' agriculture. The State
                            of Michigan appropriated $7,000 annually for the interests of
                            agriculture; Ohio, $3,500; Kentucky, $5000; New York, $8,000;
                            Pennsylvania, $4,000; Massachusetts, $6,000, and Iowa
                        Such were the annual appropriations to encourage and advance the
                            interests of agriculture by the States all around us. And way it was
                            that the State of Indiana would refuse an appropriation of 2,000 to
                            enable the State Board to hold the annual fairs, he could not divine. It
                            was with the greatest difficulty that they could hold the annual fairs.
                            And their grounds were now well nigh destroyed. He could not but regret
                            the stocking out of the appropriation, but still hoped the bill would
                            pass. He moved that the bill and proposed amendments be now taken up and
                            considered.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB hoped it would be put on its passage.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK was satisfied (upon examination since the bill was last
                            before the House) that the property of the State Board could be exempt
                            from taxation under the head of scientific institutions.
                        The bill and amendments were taken up, and the amendments (except
                            striking out the 4th section) were concurred in.
                        Pending the consideration of the latter amendment--
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to make the appropriation $1,000 instead of
                            $2,000.
                        Mr. HIGGINS and Mr. GRIFFITH called for a division of the question.
                        
                        The first question being on striking out the 4th section, was decided in
                            the affirmative--affirmative 44. negative 30.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to restore the appropriation to the extent of $1,000 a
                            year.
                        Mr. MONTGOMERY proposed $1,500.
                        Mr. BOYD proposed to make it $2,500.
                        Mr. HAMRICK stated the difficulties under which the State Board had
                            labored. He submitted regretfully to the striking out of the 4th
                            section, but he was unwilling to ask for so large an appropriation as
                            $2,500.
                        Mr. BOYD withdrew his proposition.
                        Mr. HAMRICK recounted some of the advantages resulting to the State from
                            the geological survey by Prof. Owen. He thought the House would
                            appropriate at least $1,000but certainly he would prefer $1,500. He
                            submitted that the State Board were ready to retire and give place to
                            others, if there was dissatisfaction. They had worked for nothing and
                            boarded themselves.
                        
                        Mr. Montgomery's amendment was agreed to affirmative 48, negative 32. 
                        

                        The 4th section, as amended, was then adopted: and then the bill as
                            amended,was passed the third and last reading in the House of
                            Representatives--yeas 59, nays 26--with an amendment of the title
                            proposed by Mr. Newcomb, inserting the words, "and the Treasurer of
                            State," after the words "Treasurer of Marion county." 

                    
                    
                        THE CLINTON COUNTY CONTEST.
                        Mr. KILGORE asked for unanimous consent to report from the
                                Committee on Elections.
                        There being no objection--
                        He submitted a report from a majority of the Committee on
                                Elections, on the contest of Thomas M. Hamilton for the
                            seat of Cornelius J. Miller, the Representatives from the county of
                            Clinton. A majority of the committee report that Mr. Miller received a
                            majority of 42 votes; and that the grounds of the contest (respecting
                            informality at the polls in Michigan township in said county) are not
                            sufficient to remove Mr. Miller. The report closes with a resolution for
                                 allowance of the per diem and
                            mileage of a member of the House of Representatives to Mr. Hamilton.
                        Mr. SHUEY submitted a report from the minority of the Committee on
                            Elections, submitting in detail the grounds of the contest: First, that
                            the inspectors and judges of the election in Michigan township were not
                            sworn; and secondly, alleged illegal voting; and so finding a majority
                            of 16 votes for Thomas M. Hamilton; and reporting a resolution giving
                            the seat of Mr. Miller to Mr. Hamilton; signed M. F. Shuey.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to postpone the consideration of the subject of these
                            reports till Monday week.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the previous question; and under its pressure,
                        
                        The minority resolution was rejected--yeas 3, nays 79.
                        Mr. SHUEY, explaining his vote, said he had fully assented to the
                            majority report, because be believed that Mr. Miller was elected to be
                            the Representative of Clinton county by the people voting at the October
                            election. But because there was an apparent legality and equity in the
                            claims of the contestor, he desired to bring the case before the House,
                            by way of showing what legislation is demanded to protect the purity of
                            the ballot-box. The majority of the committee having determined to make
                            their report without calling the attention of the House to the fact that
                            elections cannot be held disregarding the plain provisions of the
                            statute, he determined that the matter ought to'be brought before the
                            House as a subject demanding immediate attention. If inspectors, judges
                            and clerks can go forward with impunity and hold legal and valid
                            elections without taking the oath prescribed by law, it is time the
                            House should know and consider this matter. He had brought in this
                            report also for the purpose of showing what is the uniform practice in
                            the National House of Representatives in such cases. Having thus
                            discharged what he conceived to be his duty, by citing the action of
                            Congress, which he supposed ought to govern ours, he was willing to
                            acquiesce in the report of the majority-believing that his friend (Mr.
                            Miller) had received a majority of the votes cast by the people of
                            Clinton county.
                        The report of the majority of the committee, viz: that Cornelius J.
                            Miller is the legally elected Representative from Clinton county, was
                            then concurred in without a division.
                        
                        The resolution for per diem and mileage for Mr. Hamilton was then
                            adopted--affirmative 43, negative 29.
                    
                    
                        BILLS INTRODUCED.
                        
                        Mr. WOODRUFF introduced a bill [H. R. 192] for an act to amend the 8th
                            section of the liquor law of March 2, 1859, so as to provide a penalty
                            for the violation of the said 8th section.
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. JOHNSON introduced a bill, [H. R 193 ] for an act with reference to
                            soldiers' and marines' tax for bounties:
                         Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved that it be referred to the Judiciary
                                Committee.
                        Mr. BROWN desired to amend so that the provisions of the bill shall not
                            apply to commissioned officers.
                        The bill and proposed amendment were referred to the Committee
                                on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. COFFROTH introduced a bill [H. R. 194 ] for an act to amend the 37th
                            section of the City Corporations act of March 9, 1857.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted an amendment which went with the
                            bill to the Committee on Corporations.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, introduced a bill, [H. R. 195,] for an act to
                            amend section 2 of the Treasury act of March 1, 1859: [making the
                            revenue payable in legal tender,]
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB introduced a bill [H. R. 196] for an act to extend the time
                            allowed by law for the completion of gravelled reads: [one year:]
                        Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        On motion, of Mr. KILGORE, the Judiciary Committee's
                            bill, [H. R. 197,] for an act to provide for the purchase of the
                            stereotype plates of Gavin & Herd's Revised Statutes, &c., and
                            for the publication of the laws of the present session therein, was
                            taken from the files, and passed the second reading.
                        Mr. BECKETT introduced a bill [H. R. 198 ] for an act fixing the salaries
                            of the Supreme Judges of the State, of the Judges of the Circuit and of
                            the Common Pleas Courts, and the compensation of Prosecuting
                            Attorney:
                        Which were passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                Committee on the Organization of Courts of
                                Justice.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved to suspend the special order, and take up the
                            consideration or the General Appropriation bill, No. 176.
                        
                        The yeas and nays thereon resulted--yeas 49, nays 33: so (two-thirds not
                            voting in the affirmative,) the House refused to suspend the special
                            order.
                    
                    
                        COMMON SCHOOLS.
                        
                        Mr. RHOADS now demanded the consideration of the unfinished business of
                            the special order: viz: Mr. Rhoads's Common School bill, No. 178, with the amendments
                            thereto reported yesterday, from the Committee of the
                                Whole.
                         The fourth amendment, making the poll tax 50 cents coming up--
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved, ineffectually, to lay the amendment on the table.
                        The amendment was then agreed to. 
                        The second amendment, making the tax 18 cents on the $100, coming
                            up--
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to strike out and insert 12 cents. He felt
                            instructed against any increase of this school tax, but was willing to
                            vote for an increase of two cents.
                        Mr. COFFROTH hoped the amendment would not be adopted. He wanted to try
                            whether a liberal provision of funds will not improve our school system;
                            and if it would not he would resort to a better. The culture of children
                            was but an act of justice, a debt we owe to posterity. He moved to amend
                            the amendments so as to make the tax 25 cents on the $100.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN thought the tax of 12 cents and increased revenue on account of
                            the increase of taxable property, and the increase from the prosed
                            investment of the funds, would be sufficient to support the schools. In
                            his judgment we should be more particular as to school law, than to any
                            increase of revenue.
                        Mr. RHOADS asked if the previous question would operate on the bill.
                        The SPEAKER. It would. It would go the amendments to the order for
                            engrossment.
                        Mr. HAMRICK was satisfied with the diligence and ability which the
                                Committee on Education have displayed in this
                            bill, But it was manifest from the action in Committee of the
                                Whole yesterday, that we could not get a tax higher than
                            18 cents on the $100. The tax in this bill was its life. The school
                            system could not be developed without taxation.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, explained that all the amendments were not
                            hostile to the bill, but taken under the advice of the Superintendent of
                            Public Instruction.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH found that the House was going against other interests which
                            could not stand so well as this, and, therefore, he could not vote for
                            more than the 12 cents tax proposed.
                         Mr. MILLER, of Tippecance, proposed to amend the first section by
                            striking out all after the word "school," in the fifth line. He
                            complained of the disposition to consume time by hostile amendments and
                            dilatory motion.
                        The SPEAKER said the power of offering amendments was exhausted.
                        
                        Mr. BUSKIRK'S amendment was then rejected--yeas 35. nays 49.
                        Mr. LANE submitted the following amendment: "Strike out 18 and insert
                            16." He was a friend of the bill, and he thought this tax of 16 cents
                            would afford six month schools.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed (16 being a good medium between 12 and 18,) that
                            this vote be taken as the sense of the House between 18 and any lower
                            number.
                        
                        Mr. LANE'S amendment to the committee amendment was agreed
                            to--affirmative 43, negative 39.
                        On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the committee amendment to the first section as
                            amended was adopted.
                        Further amendments reported from the committee of the whole, chiefly
                            clerical, were concurred in.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved to restore the 5th section with the
                            amendment in the committee of the whole, authorising three trustees.
                        Mr. DUNHAM preferred to hare a single trustee. It was the wish of eminent
                            friends of the schools.
                        Mr. WRIGHT concurred.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Three trustees would be a safeguard against corruption.
                        Mr. McVEY was decidedly in favor of three.
                        Mr. Dunbam's amendment was rejected.
                        And then Mr. Miller of Tippecanoe's amendment was agreed to.
                        The next amendment of the committee, striking out the 9th section, coming
                            up--
                        Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend, by striking out the last clause--all that
                            refers to publication of the statements of receipts in the
                            newspapers.
                        The amendment to the amendment was then agreed to.
                        And then the section, as amended, was adopted.
                        The next amendment of the Committee of the Whole,
                            striking out section 132--coming up--
                        Mr. RHOADS said we had school libraries now in the State to the value of
                            over a million dollars. This same tax for libraries had been paid since
                            1853. It was as little as we could do to levy one cent on the $100 to
                            increase those libraries.
                        Mr. DUNHAM and Mr. BUSKIRK concurred in this view, adding others
                            favorable to retaining the section.
                        Mr. STRINGER had moved to strike out this section. This desire to
                            increase these libraries came from the cities and towns. They were
                            worthless to the people of the country.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. All his interests were in farming, and it was in the outer
                            neighborhoods that he had learned the value of libraries.
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK'S observation of the school libraries would induce him to
                            vote to retain the section.
                        The House refused to strike out the section.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said there was some inaccuracies in the printing
                            of the bill, and some corrections from suggestions of the Superintendent
                            of Public Instruction. He submitted sundry corrections which he had
                            marked into the printed bill.
                        Mr. RICE submitted that these inaccuracies were correct in the original
                            bill.
                        Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend section 168, by inserting the word "white"
                            before the word "children," and also to strike out the clause requiring
                            that the principles of the State and Federal Governments shall be taught
                            in the schools. He did, not want abolition teaching sanctioned by law in
                            the common shools.
                    
                    
                        MAJOR GENERAL KIMBALL.
                        [The SPEAKER announced that General Kimball was present, and he supposed
                            gentlemen would like to see him.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved that the General be invited to the privilege of the
                            Hall.
                        Major General Kimball (being introduced by His Excellency, Governor
                            Morton, and received by members of the House of Representatives standing
                            in their places) expressed thanks for the honor conferred upon him by
                            the Representatives of the people. He also was a representative of the
                            State of Indiana; was glad to see gentlemen, and say to them that
                            Indiana soldiers had done their duty. The flag of Indiana was the
                            proudest flag in America, except the flag of the United States. He hoped
                            our people at home would continue to strive for the maintenance of the
                            honor of the State as successfully as her sons have been doing in the
                            South.]
                        Mr. SIM. This section did not provide for teaching politics.
                        

                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. As it seems to interfere with the politics of
                            gentlemen on the other side of the House, I hope it will be stricken
                            out. [Laughter.]Mr. SIM. Not one word of politics was in the section.
                            The Gentleman will certainly have his boy taught the history of his
                            country, and the principles of the State and Federal Governments.
                        Mr. LASSELLE. The teaching on one side or the other would be as the
                            teacher might be, Democrat, or Republican. He thought it best to strike
                            out, and allow no distinction in this regard
                        Mr. RICE moved to amend, by striking out section 121 for the appointment
                            of an Assistant Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                        Pending these motions--
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.

                        
                            SOLDIERS' VOTE BILL.
                            
                            The SPEAKER announced the special order, viz: The consideration of
                                the Judiciary Committee's amendment to which Branham's bill [H. R.
                                137.] a bill providing for voting by electors of the State absent in
                                the military or naval service of the United States, directing the
                                methods by which the same shall be done, and prescribing penalties
                                for violating any of the rights and privileges secured by this
                                act-the question being on the adoption of this amendment.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK made an ineffectual motion to postpone the special order
                                till 7 o'clock to-night.
                            The amendment was then read through by the Clerk.
                            Mr. Speaker PETTIT (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,) moved the correction
                                of clerical errors in the printed copy, and they were corrected
                                accordingly.
                            Mr. BROWN proposed to amend in the 14th section, so as to unite the
                                Attorney General, Auditor, Treasurer and Secretary of State, with
                                the Governor, in the distribution of ballots to absent electors.
                            Mr. PETTIT would not charge an executive duty on so many
                                officers.
                            Mr. BROWN said it made the Governor the absolute judge in the
                                distribution of the ballots. He saw nothing wrong in uniting the
                                State officers with him. It would strengthen the public confidence.
                                He was for securing as far as may be, a fair and honest
                                administration. The people would have stronger confidence in any
                                public officer, if it were made impossible for him to do wrong. He
                                demanded the yeas and nays on this amendment.
                            
                            The amendment was rejected-yeas 35, nays 48.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved to insert the word ''October" instead of "annual,"
                                in the second line of the 14th section.
                            Mr. PETTIT hoped that it would be done, with a similar change in the
                                6th section.
                            It was agreed to.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK should vote against the committee's amendment, and
                                against the bill on its passage, because the constitutional power to
                                pass it was wanting. He read from the 2d section of article second
                                of the State Constitution, and from the 13th and 14th sections of
                                same article. These settle the time and manner and piece of voting
                                at elections. It was not competent for the Legislature to extend,
                                enlarge or restrict the specific provisions of the Constitution.
                            There were two questions here, viz: as to the power, and as to the
                                expediency, of this legislation. He should confine himself to the
                                consideration of the power. The State of Connecticut had passed such
                                a law as this; and. he read from a court decision under it, to show
                                that the power was wanting to infringe constitutional provisions
                                regulating the elective franchise. The court held that the
                                Connecticut law was unconstitutional; and the election previsions in
                                the Connecticut constitution were not as specific as in our State
                                constitution. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire had passed on the
                                same question. We laid, down the general proposition that no man can
                                vote by proxy; and to this was the decision of the Supreme Court of
                                New Hampshire, from which he read, in the American Law Register. He
                                also referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
                                alleging also that the election provisions in the Pennsylvania
                                constitution are not as specific as ours. The court says the voter
                                shall make "manual deliverery" of his ballot at the proper time and
                                place. Civil officers as -well as soldiers sometimes-- volunteer in
                                a service which is inconsistent with the exercise of the elective
                                franchise.
                            The Supreme Court of Iowa, whose decision he also cited and read,
                                sustained the Soldiers Vote act of that State, does nothing more
                                than prescribe the residence of the elector, leaving it in the power
                                of the Legislature to fix the time, place and manner of voting. He
                                cited other decisions, as that of the Supreme Court or the State of
                                Vermont, sustaining his allegation. The Supreme Court of Michigan
                                also had recently decided that the law of that State for soldiers
                                voting was unconstitutional. He showed that our Constitution fixes
                                the time, place, and manner of voting, and leaves nothing to the
                                Legislature, and that the common law requires the men to vote in
                                person. These decisions of Republican judges, (they were all
                                Republicans except Judge Woodward of Pennsylvania,) sustained his
                                position against this bill.
                            He had yet another authority, derived from a good lawyer--the
                                embodiment, head and front of the Republican party--His Excellency
                                Governor O. P. Morton. It was to the effect, that since it is plain
                                that, "under the Constitution, the voter must vote in his own
                                precinct, the Constitution should be amended," &c. Considering
                                this man's position, his learning and talent, his opinion was
                                entitled to the respect of the House in the consideration of this
                                bill. He read from a decision of the (Republican) Supreme Court of
                                the State of Minnesota, to the point of the danger of the deviation
                                in legislation from express constitutional restrictions. He appealed
                                to gentlemen, in view of the responsibility of their position, to be
                                well advised in this matter, lest, in their enthusiastic devotion to
                                the soldiers' interests, they strike down this fundamental law. Let
                                us rather  the advice of
                                Governor Morion, and change the Constitution if it is wrong. 
                            Mr. PETTIT. The gentleman from Monroe could not feel more respect
                                than he for these authorities. In our Constitution the people seem
                                to have measured the authority of legislation. But his Constitution
                                was the reverse of the construction that should be put upon the
                                Federal Constitution. That should be strict and literal whilst ours
                                should be broad and liberal. I would be well to look into other
                                State Constitutions, and see how they are like or unlike our own.
                                Every single decision which had been read, and upon which the
                                gentleman relied, was constrained to specific constitutional
                                provisions. He excepted the judicial determination of Judge
                                Woodward, which was very soon after its delivery, reversed and
                                overthrown by the same State judiciary. The New England and Iowa
                                decisions made his position very plain. The old New England town
                                meeting voting practice was still of force there, being most
                                specifically prescribed in their Constitution, from which he read.
                                They required the personal presence of the voter-present and
                                qualified to vote. The same explanation served him by was of reply
                                to the gentleman's extracts from the Connecticut, Vermont and New
                                Hampshire decisions. He read from the Iowa decision. Thus he removed
                                authorities that were made to stand in the way of soldiers' voting.
                                He showed that the Vermont court decision did not restrict
                                legislation to enable the soldier to vote for President and Vice
                                President of the United States. And he asked gentlemen to answer in
                                all candor, if the framers of our State Constitution could have
                                contemplated the disfranchisement of soldiers in the field?
                            Mr. DUNHAM referred to contemporaneous legislation as the best
                                interpretation of the Constitution-admitting that the Constitution
                                was not self-exacting--that legislation must prescribe the methods
                                of securing rights.
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER here asked the gentleman from Wabash to give
                                way for the reading of a dispatch from the Secretary of War, (dated
                                Washington, February 4, 1865,) to this effect: "Dispatches just
                                received, announce that Wilmington is in possession of our troops."
                                [Cheers]
                            Mr. PETTIT thanked the gentleman from Floyd for the suggestion, that
                                the law is necessary to receive the method of obtaining rights. If
                                the soldier has cot the right to vote, we may create the method by
                                which that right may be exercised. The argument of the gentleman
                                from Monroe goes to the point that men in the service of the United
                                States should not have the right of suffrage. The very clause which
                                the gentleman referred to, was to preserve our political right, just
                                as other clauses preserve our property rights. He read the elector's
                                qualifying clause--''shall be entitled to vote in the township where
                                he resides." Nothing is necessary but the residence.
                            It was an incontravertable position of public law, that every person
                                who goes abroad without a purpose of abandoning his government,
                                shall not lose any right thereby. So it was in case of the soldier
                                in the field. Our people, though mustered into the service of the
                                United States, are still residents of the State of Indiana. The
                                gentleman says that the citizen shall vote in the place and at the
                                time of election. This bill provides the instrument by which he may
                                vote. That instrument has no life in it till the day of election,
                                nor on the day of election, till five o'clock in the afternoon. The
                                only difficulty is in regard to the method. Could if be doubted that
                                the Legislature could provide a method by which a sick man at home,
                                having the right to vote, may do so? The Constitution did not
                                require the presence of the voter at the polls. The single purpose
                                of this provision of the Constitution, was that a man shall vote in
                                his own township. Its only design was to prevent too-large
                                gatherings to vote at the county seat. He concluded by saying, that
                                his mind was very much at ease with respect to every legal objection
                                that has raised against this bill, because he knew that our action
                                would be subject to the adjudication of courts, whose judges
                                commanded deserved the public confidence.
                            Mr. DUNHAM said under the present law of Congress, and by the
                                articles of war, the recruit in the State of Indiana--the volunteer
                                or drafted man, was as much a United States soldier as though he
                                were in the regular service.
                            Mr. COFFROTH denied that Judge Woodward's decision was reversed. But
                                the people of Pennsylvania had amended their Constitution so as to
                                authorize the soldier to vote. Judge W. was one of the most upright
                                men in the United States.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Was he not inimical to the Government?
                            Mr. COFFROTH. Never.
                            Mr. PETTIT. If the gentleman was correct, he was not unwilling to
                                concede all he desired. He submitted that the militia is a State
                                institution. The Federal Government makes a demand for troops on the
                                Governor. The Governor musters the troops and makes the commissions.
                                And the Indiana citizen is still a citizen of Indiana though he may
                                have gone beyond the limits of the State for the public service,
                                for, when his service was ended, he returns to his State again.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. Certainly contemporaneous history was the best source of
                                interpretation of Constitutions. And there was no construction more
                                certain than this, that the qualified voter shall vote always in
                                person. He held the contrary of the reckless allegation that
                                Constitutions were not made for such times as these.--They were made
                                precisely for these times. He cared nothing for decisions ia this
                                argument. He would be found in history that when republics have lost
                                their liberties, it was when the ballot-box was seized by soldiers
                                in the field. The elective franchise "belonged to the freemen at
                                home. In order to the due exercise of this right, freedom of
                                thought, freedom of speech, and the press was most distinctly
                                implied.
                            There was not freedom of speech in the armies. It was contracted,
                                curtailed, and suppressed by the shoulder straps. If their
                                commanders would not suffer the soldiers to read what they please,
                                would gentlemen argue that they should vote without the information
                                which can enable them to subserve the public welfare ?  They cannot vote freely and
                                intelligently without the freedom of speech and the press. Could the
                                soldier be said to have the freedom of speech, where the officer is
                                disgraced and turned out of the service simply for an open and manly
                                expression of opinion adverse to the negro policy of the
                                Administration? Where officers hold this power, the army becomes a
                                mere machine, and the nearer it becomes a mere machine the better
                                for the service. He did not object to the rights of the soldiers,
                                but he desired to preserve the liberties of the people.
                            Mr. GROVES demanded the previous question, and there was a
                                second.
                            The main question, to wit: Shall the amendment substitute reported by
                                the Judiciary Committee be adopted? was decided in the affirmative
                                without a division.
                            So, what is understood to be Mr. Speaker Pettit's bill was adopted in
                                place of Mr. Branham's.
                            Mr. BROWN insisted that the bill had not been read the second
                                time.
                            Mr. PETTIT stated the action on this bill. It was read the second
                                time yesterday afternoon. So the journal has it.
                            Mr. BROWN then insisted that proper action could not be had without
                                the consideration of the report of the minority of the Judiciary
                                Committee. The Chair announced that that report would be in order
                                after the consideration of the common school bill.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) held that now, under the
                                pleasure of the previous question, the minority paper could not come
                                up, The Chair then caused the journal record of this matter to he
                                read by the Clerk.
                            Mr. BROWN was satisfied with the record, though it was incomplete as
                                to facts.
                            The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken, on the order for
                                engrossment and third reading, resulted--yeas 51, nays 29, as

                            It was then read through the third time by the Clerk.

                         SATURDAY, February 25, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    Mr. BONHAM presented two petitions from citizens of Blackford county praying
                        for an amendment to the liquor law requiring the applicant for license to
                        procure the signatures of a majority of the voters of any incorporated town
                        or city, or township, to his petition to the Board of County Commissioners
                        before license shall be granted, so that no license shall be obtained unless
                        a majority are in favor of such license; which was referred to the
                            Committee on Temperance without reading. 
                    
                        CORPORATIONS.
                        Mr. WARD offered the following:
                        Mr. PRESIDENT-- The Joint Committee on
                                Corporations to whom were referred the various bills
                            introduced into the Senate and House, amendatory of the general law for
                            the incorporation of cities have had the said bills under consideration,
                            and as the result of their labors beg leave to report the following
                            bill, which embraces all the legislation necessary on the subject, and
                            codifies all previous legislation relating thereto.
                        They therefore recommend that engrossed Senate bill No. 103 (which with
                            other Senate bills on the subject, are herewith reported back,) be
                            amended so as to strike out all after the enacting clause and insert,
                            the bill herewith reported in lieu thereof.
                        The Committee further recommend that Senate bills Nos. 80, 94, 85, 139,
                            162 and 176 be laid upon the table.
                        The Committee, also recommend that in case of the passage of the bill,
                            the title thereof be changed to read as follows :"An act repealing all
                            general laws now in force for the incorporation of cities, providing for
                            the incorporation of cities, prescribing their powers, rights and
                            duties, and the manner in which they shall exercise the same, and
                            regulating other matters properly connected therewith, and repealing
                            certain acts therein specified."The new bill reported by the committee
                            (containing 93 sections,) was read through; and then--
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE
                        Were granted Messrs. Vawter and Allison till Monday, 2 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        RE-ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCUIT AND PROBATE
                            COURTS.
                        Mr. OYLER submitted the following:
                        
                            Mr. PRESIDENT-The Committee on the
                                Organization of Courts, to whom was referred sundry
                            petitions and memorials upon the propriety and expediency of a change in
                            the judicial system of the State, offered by Mr. Moore and others, have
                            had the same under consideration, and have instructed me to report that
                            a change is desirable, and that a change which would result in a full
                            and complete separation of the probate business, from the civil and
                            criminal practice and business of the Courts is much to be desired ; and
                            to effect this the Committee have instructed me to prepare and present

                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES

                        Mr. HANNA submitted the following:
                        Mr. PRESIDENT : Senate bill No. 62, which was
                            originally referred to the Committee on Corporations,
                            and reported back and its passage recommended, having been re-committed
                            to the Committee on the Judiciary, and the last named
                            Committee having reported the bill back to the Senate with the
                            recommendation that it be re-committed to the Committee of
                                Corporations, with instructions to strike out the 5th
                            section of the bill, and the Senate having concurred in the report, and
                            the Committee on Corporations having again had the
                            bill under consideration, beg leave to report that they have, in
                            obedience to the instructions of the Senate, stricken out the 5th
                            section of the bill
                        Upon further consideration of the bill, the committee are of opinion that
                            the subject of the bill is not properly expressed in the title.
                        The title of the bill is "An Act supplemental to an act, entitled 'An act
                            to authorize the formation of limited partnerships, and fixing the
                            liabilities of the several partners and prescribing the proceedings
                            against them,' approved March 5, 1859, authorizing compromises by
                            partners and joint debtors." The committee respectfully submit that the
                            bill is in no proper sense supplemental to the act named as it is
                            general in its provisions, and applies to all co-partnerships, general
                            or limited, and therefore the title should be changed. The committee is
                            also of opinion that so much of the second section of the act as
                            proposes to change the general practice of the courts, by allowing
                            affirmative matter to be given in evidence under the general denial,
                            without specially pleading it, should be stricken out. Your committee,
                            therefore, return the bill with the recommendation that it be
                            recommitted to the Judiciary Committee, with
                            instructions to amend the title and second section as above
                            indicated.
                        Which reports were severally concurred in.
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The following bills were introduced, read the first time and passed to
                            the second reading:

                            officers thereof, its powers and duties; for the transfer of business in

                            of the makers of such contracts, but not against all.
                        By Mr. ALLISON, [S. 187,] to amend section 3 of an act to reduce the laws
                            incorporating the city of Madison into one act, approved February 14,
                            1848.

                            March 7, 1861, so far as relates to the county of Jefferson.
                        On motion by Mr. ALLISON, the two bills last above described were read by
                            title only and referred to the appropriate committees,
                        By Mr. CULVER, [S. 189,] to apportion Senators and Representatives for
                            the next four years.
                    
                    
                        AQUILLA JONES.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS presented a memorial setting forth, that while Treasurer of
                            State, in November, 1858, Aquilla Jones advanced to Governor Willard
                            $859 08 above what was due at the time, taking a receipt therefor; which
                            sum of money the memorialist has never yet received from the estate of
                            the Governor, it being wholly insolvent. The memorialist presents the
                            said receipt, and asks that the said sum of money may be refunded to
                            him.
                        It was referred to the Committee on Claims.
                    
                    
                        THE BLIND ASYLUM.
                        On motion by Mr. NlLES, it was-
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Benevolent Institutions be instructed to
                                        ascertain and report to the Senate, by what authority a
                                        street has been opened through the grounds of the Asylum for
                                        the Blind, and what action, if any, is proper to be taken in
                                        relation to said streets, with leave to the committee to
                                        report by bill or otherwise.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        STATUTES FOR EACH SENATOR.
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS it was--
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That each member of the Senate
                                        be, and they are hereby authorized to retain the two volumes
                                        of Gaven and Hord's Statutes, furnished them at the
                                        commencement of this session, as their own property.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        TELEGRAPH COMPANIES.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the Lieutenant Governor was directed to add
                            another member to the special committee on the organization of telegraph
                            companies.
                         Mr. Ward was added.
                    
                    
                        WHITE WATER VALLEY CANAL
                        
                        Messrs. Richmond and Hanna addressed the Chair. The former being
                            recognized-
                         Mr. RICHMOND moved to adjourn.
                        
                         The yeas and nays were demanded by seven Senators, and being ordered and
                            taken, resulted yeas 9, nays 27.
                        So the Senate refused to adjourn.
                        Mr. OYLER moved a call of the Senate.
                        
                        The yeas and nays were demanded by Messrs. Cullen and Richmond, which
                            being ordered and taken, resulted yeas 7, nays 29.
                        So the Senate refused to order a call.
                        Mr. HANNA withdrew his motion to reconsider and to lay that motion on the
                            table, which he made late last evening, immediately after the vote
                            adopting the resolution calling for the return from the Senate Committee
                            of the bill H. R. 59.
                        Mr. CULLEN objected.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR stated it to be his impression that any Senator
                            may withdraw his motion or resolution at any time before action is taken
                            upon it.
                        Mr. CULLEN appealed from the decision of the chair.
                        The question being "Shall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment
                            of the Senate?"Messrs. Cullen and Richmond demanded the yeas and
                            nays.
                        Mr. RICHMOND asked to be excused from voting.
                        Messrs Cullen and Oyler demanded the yeas and nays on the motion to be
                            excused.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided that there can be no demand for the yeas
                            and nays on a question of excusing a Senator from voting, pending a
                            previous call of the yeas and nays on the question of appeal. If such
                            were the case, two Senators could at all times block legislation. All
                            they would have to do, to effect that purpose, would be for one Senator
                            to ask to be excused from voting, and on that question demand the yeas
                            and nays, and then ask again to be excused, and so on indefinitely.
                            Under our rules, when a question is in debate, no motion can be
                            received, but to adjourn, to lay on the table, for the previous
                            question, to postpone indefinitely, to postpone to a day certain, to
                            commit, or to amend; and upon no question can the yeas and nays be
                            taken, except those.
                        Mr. RICHMOND appealed from the decision of the chair, and to support his
                            appeal, read from section 12, art. 4 of the State Constitution, these
                            words: "Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and publish
                            the same. The yeas and nays, on any question, shall, at the request of
                            any two members, be entered, together with the names of the members
                            demanding the same, on the journal." It has been the ruling in the other
                            end of the capitol, and but to-day it was decided that on every motion a
                            demand for the yeas and nays can be made, by two members, and they must
                            be taken if so demanded. This decision of the chair, is entirely in
                            direct violation of the provision of the Constitution just read.
                        Mr. OYLER was of the same opinion as the Senator from Howard (Mr.
                            Richmond,) on this point, and spoke against the decision of the Chair,
                            basing his opposition upon the same ground, taken by that Senator.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. Senators insist that they have the right to
                            demand the yeas and nays, because the Constitution in the twelfth
                            section of the fourth article says, "The yeas and nays, on any question
                            shall, at the request of any two members, be entered together with the
                            names of the members demanding the same on the journal," &c., and to
                            refuse this, it is said, is to disregard a clear constitutional right.
                            It is assumed that the proposition to excuse a Senator from from voting
                            is a question within the meaning of the Constitution, and if this
                            assumption be granted, the right to demand the yeas and nays must
                            follow. I, however, deny the assumption altogether. The proposition to
                            excuse a Senator from voting on a question propounded to the Senate, is
                            not itself a question within the meaning of the Constitution. The
                            Constitution must have a practicable and reasonable construction.
                        The constitution also provides that "each House shall have all powers
                            necessary for a branch of the Legislative Department of a free and
                            independent State" but if the construction contended for be correct, the
                            Senate is powerless in the hands of any two Senators who may so will. If
                            two Senators, pending a call of the yeas and nays on any question, may,
                            on a proposition to excuse one of them from voting, call the yeas and
                            nays, may not the other of the two Senators ask to be excused from
                            voting on the question as to excusing the first Senator, and may not;
                            both demand the yeas and nays on the last named proposition to excuse,
                            and so on without limit? If it is a constitutional right it cannot be
                            controlled by usage, but usage must give way to the constitution. The
                            16th Rule of the Senate provides that "no Senator shall be compelled to
                            vote on any question in the even of which he is immediately or
                            particularly interested, or in any case when he was not present when the
                            question was put." The 18th Rule provides that "every Senator who shall
                            be the house when the question was put, shall give his vote, unless the
                            Senate, for special reason excuse him."
                        These rules do not make the proposition to excuse a Senator from voting a
                            question within the meaning of the Constitution, or within the meaning
                            of the twenty-second rule of the Senate, prescribing what motions shall
                            be received, (when a question is under debate,) and their order of
                            precedence. Such would have been my decision from the necessity and
                            reason of the case in the absence of authority, but the Supreme Court
                            has given a similar construction to another section of the Constitution.
                            Section 5 of the 7th article, provides that "the Supreme Court shall
                            upon the decision of every case give a statement in writing of each
                            question arising in the record of such case, and the decision of the
                            Court thereon."The Supreme Court has found it impracticable to literally
                            comply with this requirement, and has construed the section to mean that
                            only such questions arising in the record, as are necessary to a
                            determination of the merits of the cause are to be decided.
                         Minorities have rights, and these rights should always be respected, but
                            they have neither the right nor the power under the Constitution and
                            rules of the Senate, to prevent legislation on the part of this
                            body.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS read the 16th and 18th rules of the Senate. If he were the
                            presiding officer  and a Senator
                            should ask to be excused from voting and offer reasons good and
                            sufficient, he would give that Senator the right to a decision of the
                            Senate on the question, but if the reasons were not such as he should
                            think were fair and embraced in the 16th rule, he would certainly not
                            entertain the motion to be excused. He would not entertain motions that
                            would lock the Senate and destroy legislation, he thought the chair did
                            right to use some discretion, if the reasons were such as are referred
                            to in the 16th rule, he should certainly entertain a motion to be
                            excused.
                        Mr. NILES also concurred in the position assumed by the chair.
                        Mr. Niles said he thought that the question might be determined by
                            inquiring whether the 12th section of article 4 of the Constitution
                            would have been adopted in its present form, and without qualification,
                            by any sensible man, had it been supposed that it would include motions
                            of no practical importance, and having no bearing on the business of
                            legislation. The yeas and nays can be required on every question that is
                            really substantial and pertinent. When a Senator states that he has a
                            pecuniary and personal interest in a question, then, under the 16th
                            rule, then a motion to excuse him from voting becomes material. But when
                            such a motion is made without any foundation for it, it is wholly
                            immaterial, and the yeas and says cannot properly be demanded. A fair
                            construction of the Constitution includes all material questions and no
                            others. So the Supreme Court is required by the words of the
                            Constitution to decide every question raised in a record, but it is
                            properly held to include only the material points. What are commonly
                            known as filibustering motions, if entertained at all, ought not to be
                            dignified by a call of the yeas and nays. The decision of the Chair in
                            this case, if adhered to, will tend to protect the dignity of the
                            Senate, and to preserve in their integrity our republican
                            institutions.
                        Mr. CULLEN withdrew his objection.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR then announced that the motions to reconsider and
                            lay on the table were withdrawn by the Senator [Mr. Hanna] who made them
                            just before the adjournment last evening.
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved that the Senate adjourn.
                        The yeas and nays were demanded by one-tenth of the Senators present, and
                            being ordered and taken resulted yeas 19, nays 17.
                        So the Senate adjourned.
                    
                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         SATURDAY, February 25, 1865.
                    
                    The House met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    On motion of Mr. MONTGOMERY, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with.
                    Mr. Zeigler had indefinite leave of absence--a death in his family.
                    Mr. Trusler had leave of absence--sickness of a child.
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM and Mr. NEWCOMB presented memorials for claims, which were
                            referred to the Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. HOWARD presented a memorial from the convicts of the State Prison
                            south, praying for an increase of the amount of money [$15] allowed by
                            law to each discharged prisoner, which was referred to the
                                Committee on the Southern Prison.
                        Mr. LOPP presented the petition of sundry citizens, tax-payers of
                            Harrison county, with reference to remuneration for their losses of
                            property, (principally horses,) on account of the Morgan raid, which was
                            referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
                        Mr. McVEY and Mr. CHAMBERS presented temperance memorials, which were
                            referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. COFFROTH presented a memorial from sundry citizens of the State on
                            the subject of the practice of medicine and surgery, which was laid on
                            the table.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Banks, returned
                            the bill [H. R. 189] to amend the 52d section of the general banking
                            law, recommending its passage. 
                        Mr. CHURCH, from the Committee on Swamp Lands,
                            returned Mr. Collins's Drainage bill, No. 23, with amendments, viz:
                            First section: Strike out "three" and insert "one." Section 2. Add
                            clause for publication of notice three weeks in some newspaper of
                            general circulation in said county, if there be one. Section 5. And file
                            the same with the County Auditor. Section 6. Add a condition-if they
                            find the work one of public utility, and the payment of damages, if
                            any.
                        Mr. RIFORD, from the same committee, returned Mr. Hoover's bill [H. R.
                            No. 60] to authorize a thorough and complete drainage of the public and
                            private lands of the State, recommending that it be laid on the
                            table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. CHURCH, from the same committee, returned Mr. Coffroth's bill, [H. R.
                            No. 81,] to amend section 2 of the act to enable the owners of wet lands
                            to drain and reclaim them, when the same can be done without affecting
                            the rights of others, recommending its passage.
                    
                    
                        TALBOT & COSTIGAN.
                        Mr. HENDRICKS, from the Committee on Claims, reported
                            on the claim of Talbot & Costigan, and the opinion of the committee
                            that the amount claimed was included in the act of 1851, for payment;
                            and at the request of the parties they recommend that it be laid on the
                            table.
                        By request of Mr. BUSKIRK, there was an order taken on the report. 
                    
                    
                        MORRISON & RAY.
                        Mr. VEACH, from the same committee returned the claim of Morrison &
                            Ray for attorney's fees, in the case of Mary J. Jamison, with
                            accompanying papers, recommending that they lie on the table.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the report and papers be referred to the
                                Committee on the Judiciary.
                        
                         Mr. HENRICKS. This claim had been before the Legislature for years, and
                            reported upon unfavorably by every committee that had investigated
                            it-and once by the Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. The Judiciary Committee reported that
                            they had not time to investigate it.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK knew enough about this claim to say, that manifest injustice
                            had been done to Morrison & Ray. They attended an action at law,
                            involving the title to the land on which the Lunatic Asylum is situated,
                            resulting in quieting the State's title. He trusted that it would be
                            referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB referred to and read the House Journal of the matter on page
                            729in the proceedings of the last day of the last session. The committee
                            reported that they had act time to investigate said claim. It was not
                            doing justice to Morrison & Ray, or the State, to pass the matter
                            without investigation.
                        It was referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                    
                    
                        CLAIMS.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, reported back
                            the claims of C. A. Woodward; of Elder, Harkness & Bingham--$1,766
                            66, for newspapers; of W. R. Holloway & Co.--$1,766 66, for
                            newspapers; also for blank books, $, and of David Stevenson for
                            statutes--which were referred to the Committee on Ways and
                                Means, with instructions that they be incorporated in the
                            Specific Appropriation bill.
                        Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,
                            returned Mr. Atkinson's Fees bill [H. R. No. 184] recommending its
                            passage.
                        Mr. RIFORD, from the Committee on County and Township
                                Business, returned the resolution for the repeal of
                            section 16 of the supervisor's act, reporting such legislation
                            inexpedient, and that the said resolution be laid on the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM SPECIAL COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, from the select committee on his bill [H. R. No.
                            181] to amend section 7, of the act of June 7,1852, prescribing the
                            duties of clerks,--with clerical amendments--"such clerk shall be
                            entitled to 15 cents for every hundred words," &c-recommending its
                            passage.
                        Mr. STEWART, from the Select Committee on Mr. Trusler's bill, fixing the
                            times of courts in the Fourth Judicial Circuit, reporting that it be
                            laid on the table.
                    

                    
                        ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the House bills numbered
                                            176, 153 and 140,
                                        be made the special order for 10 1/2 o'clock this day,
                                        February 26th.
                                
                            
                        
                        He explained that these bills were respectively, The General
                            Appropriation bill; the bill ratifying the action of the Governor in
                            procuring an advance of $250,000 from the President of the United
                            States, for the preparation of troops, and directing, &c., [see page
                            179 of these Reports;] and the bill ratifying the action of the Governor
                            in settling and discharging the State's quota of direct tax levied by
                            the Congress in 1861, and authorizing him to settle all unsettled claims
                            of the State against the General Government.
                        Mr. BROWN desired to amend the resolution so as to include the Senate
                            bill No. 30, and several others.
                        Mr. COFFROTH had no purpose to retard the Appropriation bill, but did not
                            want objectionable measures hurried. He recited the course pursued
                            toward the minority of the Judiciary Committee, with
                            regard to the consideration and passage of the Soldiers' Vote bill. He
                            felt as one of the minority, something of the purpose and impulse of
                            self-preservation--to prevent obnoxious measures being rushed through
                            without time for due consideration. He considered that the resolution
                            was in conflict with the rules, which required two-thirds to take up
                            business out of order, and place them in advance on the calendar.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK answered. He recited the rules 55 and 63, with reference to
                            the order of business and the change and suspension of rules, and
                            submitted that bills could not be made the special order by resolution
                            while they remained on the Speaker's table. They could not be taken up
                            out of order without the consent of two-thirds. There was no design to
                            delay the appropriation bills. There might have seemed to be an effort
                            in that direction, but there was no general purpose to that effect on
                            the part of the minority, further than might be necessary to maintain a
                            decent respect for the rights of the minority. He hoped the gentleman
                            from Jefferson would withdraw his resolution and be content to reach his
                            object in a legitimate manner, by motion to suspend the rules, and
                            pledged himself with the minority to vote for such motions to advance
                            every public bill.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB, in his legislative experience, never saw a minority treated
                            with more respectful consideration than in this House. He recited facts
                            in the proceedings on the amendments to the Constitution of the United
                            States, and on the soldiers' vote bill. Was not this an effort on the
                            part of the minority to control the action of the House? Was the
                            minority responsible for the results of the session? He referred to the
                            rules to show that a majority can control the action of the body so far
                            as to make special orders. The rules were to be construed together-in pari materiae as the lawyers say. With the
                            gentleman's construction, that a majority cannot take up a bill out of
                            its regular order, we could not reach the general appropriation bill
                            before the end of the session. He thought the gentleman from Huntington
                            (Mr. Coffroth,) was mistaken in the fact, that the minority of the
                            Judiciary Committee was not allowed time to make a report. He recited
                            the facts. No man had asked to suspend the rules this session, but he
                            (Mr. N.) had voted for it.
                        Mr. BROWN never had nor never expected to oppose the consideration of
                            bills of public importance. He would vote to take up the bills indicated
                            in the resolution of the gentleman from Jefferson for carrying on the
                            State Government. The minority should not yield their power except to
                            subserve the general good-- But why the necessity for selecting these
                            bills for the special order and leave out minority measures? The
                            minority would even insist that these bills mentioned in the resolutions
                            shall be considered and passed. But he insist  [insist]-ed that the resolution was not in
                            order, and if it was in order, it could not be adopted but by a majority
                            of two-thirds. He cited the rules to sustain the allegation. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM said, in reply, that if these were his own measures, the
                            gentleman may say with some propriety that they should have no
                            preference. But it was a public measure, having preference under the
                            rules. And this as the fifth time that he had made his application to
                            consider these bills. He made no constitutitional argument. He yielded
                            the treatment of such questions to the gentleman from Monroe, not
                            knowing what the House and the country would do for advice on
                            constitutional questions when that gentleman should be no more. He
                            demanded the previous question. 
                        The SPEAKER ruled that Mr. Buskirk and Mr. Coffroth's point of order was
                            not well taken. But the House may make a special order by a majority,
                            when resolutions are in order.
                        Mr. BROWN claimed that his amendment to the resolution should be
                            entertained.
                        The SPEAKER said the Clerk had no minute of the gentleman's amendment. It
                            was made loosely in debate.
                        Mr. BROWN. The amendment was made, and be went to the gentleman from
                            Jefferson and asked him to include it.
                        The SPEAKER. As a point of fact, the gentlemen from Jackson did rise
                            while the gentleman from Hunting ton was on the floor, and proposed to
                            add the Senate bill No.,30, and a number of others.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. The gentleman from Jack-son was first on the floor.
                        The SPEAKER then directed that the amendment be noted by the Clerk.
                        
                        There was then a second for the previous question--affirmative 47,
                            negative 30.
                        Mr. BROWN asked and obtained unanimous consent to withdraw his
                            amendment.
                        
                        Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on ordering the
                            main question, which being taken, resulted--yeas 51 nays 27--so the main
                            question was ordered, viz: Shall Mr. Brown's amendment to the resolution
                            be adopted?
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the House adjourn, and demanded the yeas and nays
                            thereon--ten members rising for a second for the demand of the yeas and
                            nays.
                        
                        The House refused to adjourn--yeas 22, nays 57.
                        Mr. HARRISON moved to reconsider the vote just taken on the motion to
                            adjourn.
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays.
                        The SPEAKER held that Mr. Harrison's motion was out of order.
                        Mr. DUNHAM appealed from the decision of the chair. He submitted his
                            appeal in these words:
                        "From the decision of the chair upon the motion of the member from Shelby
                            (Mr. Harrison) to reconsider the vote upon the question of adjourning,
                            that the motion is not in order, we appeal."Signed by Mr. Dunham, Mr.
                            Harrison, and others.
                        The SPEAKER. Shall the decision of the chair stand as the judgment of the
                            House?
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker, as I took the appeal, I ask to be excused from
                            voting on this question.
                        Objection being made--
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on the question of excusing Mr.
                            Dunham from voting, and they were ordered.
                        Mr. RHOADS submitted the question of order, that it was not competent to
                            take the question of appeal by yeas and nays.
                        The SPEAKER decided that it was competent.
                        
                        The yeas and nays being taken, resulted-yeas 52, nays 37.
                        So Mr. Dunham was excused from voting.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote just taken.
                        The SPEAKER held that the motion was out of order.
                        Mr. DUNHAM moved that the House do now adjourn.
                        Whereupon--
                        Mr. COFFROTH asked to be excused from voting on the question of
                            adjournment.
                        Mr. Dunham demanded the yeas and nays, &c.
                        
                         The House refused to excuse Mr. Coffroth--yeas 26, nays 50.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote by which the House refused to
                            excuse the gentlemen from Huntington and Whitley from voting.
                        The SPEAKER held that the motion to reconsider was not in order.
                        Mr. BROWN then asked to be excused from voting on the motion to
                            adjourn.
                        Mr. COFFROTH and others demanded the yeas and nays.
                        
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Brown--yeas 14, nays 59.
                        Mr. THACHER moved to reconsider the vote just taken. [Out of order.]
                        Mr. THACHER demanded the yeas and nays on the adjournment, and they were
                            ordered.
                        Mr. SPENCER asked to be excused from voting on the motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted the point whether it is competent
                            for the gentleman to move to be excused after the yeas and nays have
                            been ordered.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair regards it as a competent motion. It is a question
                            of personal privilege.
                        Messrs. Brown and Thatcher asked and obtained leave to change their
                            votes.
                        Mr. Spencer was excused--yeas 19, nays 52.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, asked if it would not be in order to call up the
                            Common School bill. Under these motions we should not be able to do any
                            business to-day. [Voices, "Object," "object." "Yes." "Let's get through
                            this."]
                        The next series of dilatory motions resulted in refusing to excuse Mr.
                            Buskirk from voting on Mr. Dunham's motion to adjourn-yeas 20, nays
                            52.
                        Mr. DUNHAM rose to a privilege question. When the House adjourns to-day,
                            it shall be till Monday at one o'clock.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to lay the motion on the table.
                        
                        The SPEAKER held that the motion was not in order.
                        Mr. BROWN desired to appeal, but not in writing. He moved to be excused
                            from voting on the question of fixing the time to which the House shall
                            adjourn.
                        
                        Objection being made from the Democratic side--the yeas and nays were
                            demanded, ordered and taken thereon, resulting--yeas 18, nays 56--so the
                            gentleman was not excused.
                        Mr. BECKETT asked to be excused from voting on Mr. Dunham's motion.
                        Mr. HENRICKS demanded the enforcement of the 18th rule, requiring all
                            motions to be submitted in writing, when requested by any member: and he
                            thereupon demanded that these motions be submitted in writing.
                        Mr. BECKETT submitted his motion to be excused accordingly.
                        
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Beckett-yeas 11, nays 57.
                        Mr. SPENCER moved, in writing, to be excused from moting on the motion of
                            Mr. Dunham.
                        Mr. BROWN objected.
                        Mr. DUNHAM demanded the yeas and nays on the motion to be excused.
                        
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Spencer--yeas 15, nays 59.
                        Mr. BIRD moved, in writing, that on motion of the gentleman from Floyd,
                            he be excused from voting.
                        Mr. BROWN objected.
                        Mr. DUNHAM demanded the yeas and nays.
                        
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Bird--yeas 11, nays 52--no quorum
                            voting.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair held, that the gentleman could be excused without
                            a quorum.
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted considerations in opposition to the decision. Upon
                            the discovery of no quorum, on any division of the House, it was the
                            duty of the Chair to order the roll-call, &c.
                        The SPEAKER. It was not requisite on a motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. LASSELLE submitted, in writing, his motion to be excused from voting
                            on Mr. Dunham's motion to fix the time to which the House shall
                            adjourn-Monday, 1 o'clock P. M. He desired to be heard in a brief
                            statement of his reasons for moving to be excused.
                        The SPEAKER held that the gentleman could do so upon a motion to be
                            excused from voting on any other than a question of adjournment.
                        
                        Objection and a demand for the yeas and nays by Democratic members
                            followed; and the House refused to excuse Mr. Lasselle--yeas 10, nays
                            59.
                        Mr. MILROY submitted, in writing, a motion to excuse him from voting on
                            the pending adjournment.
                        
                        Objection and a demand for the yeas and nays from Democratic benches were
                            entertained, and the House refused to excuse Mr. Milroy--yeas 11, nays
                            58.
                        
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, following with a similar motion for excuse, there
                            was again objection and a demand for the yeas and nays from Democratic
                            benches. The House refused to excuse Mr. Shoaff--yeas 13, nays 59.
                        Mr. WRIGHT submitted a preamble and resolution reciting that, whereas
                            these dilatory motions are intended to waste the time of the House,
                            therefore no member shall receive his per diem for the day on which he
                            may submit such dilatory motion.
                        The SPEAKER held that the resolution was not in order.
                        Mr. LEMON submitted another dilatory motion, and it was followed as in
                            the other cases.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE submitted the authority of Cashing'a Manual, that questions
                            respecting the rights and privileges of members were subordinate to the
                            question of adjournment, and, therefore, these dilatory motions are all
                            out of order pending a motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB insisted that the motion to fix the time to which the House
                            shall adjourn is not properly a motion to adjourn.
                        The SPEAKER gave the authority, and adhered to the former decision of the
                            Chair. 
                        So Mr. Whiteside's point of order was overruled.
                        
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Lemon--yeas 19, nays 52.
                        
                        The question on Mr. Dunham's motion, that when the House adjourns to-day
                            it shall be till Monday at one o'clock P. M., was now taken, and the
                            order was rejected-yeas 16, nays 57.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that when the House adjourns to-day it shall adjourn to
                            Monday at two o'clock P. M.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to amend the motion by fixing the time at Monday 3
                            o'clock P. M.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to lay both motions on the table.
                        The SPEAKER held that the motion to lay on the table is out of order.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted a motion in writing to excuse him from voting on the
                            amendment to his order.
                        
                        Objection, and a demand and second for the yeas and nays followed from
                            democratic benches, and the House refused to excuse Mr. Brown-yeas 10,
                            nays 57,
                        Mr. GRIFFITH understood that there was an order for adjournment at
                            half-past 12 P. M. It was that hour now by the clock, and he moves to
                            adjourn.
                        The SPEAKER. There is a pending motion to adjourn, which the House may
                            reach some time this afternoon.
                         Mr. BRANHAM hoped that the House would not adjourn without the adoption
                            of the pending order with reference to the consideration of the General
                            Appropriation bill, &c.
                        
                        Mr. SPENCER next moved excuses-and the dilatory result discovered no
                            quorum voting--yeas 7, nays 48.
                        The SPEAKER holding (against the question raised by Mr. Buskirk,) that
                            less than a quorum can dispose of all question with the adjournment.
                        
                         Mr. THACHER, next in the routine, failed to obtain excuse-yeas 8, nays
                            36.
                        
                         Mr. Buskirk's amendment for Monday 3 o'clock P. M,, was then
                            rejected-yeas 4, nays 37.
                        Mr. SPENCER proposed to amend the order offered by Mr. Brown, so as to
                            fix the time of adjournment to Monday 3 1/2 o'clock P. M.
                        
                        
                        And thereupon he asked to be excused from voting. After the routine, the
                            House refused to excuse Mr. Spencer-yeas 6, nays 35.
                         Mr. Spencer's amendment was then rejected without a division. 
                        Mr. Brown's adjournment order was also rejected.
                         Mr. RICE moved ineffectually that the House do now adjourn.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Henrick in the chair,) now returned to the consideration
                            of Mr. Dunham's appeal.
                         Mr. Speaker PETTIT advised adjournment. The consideration of the appeal
                            would be first in order this afternoon.
                        Mr. SHUEY moved that the House adjourn till 2 1/2 o'clock.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted that the last motion which was made was a motion to
                            adjourn. There had been no intervening business. 
                        Mr. PETTIT. They were different motions.
                        The adjournment wag then ordered, and so the House took a recess till 2
                            1/2 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER laid before the House a communication from W. H. H. Terrell,
                            Adjutant General, with reference to the pay of certain Indiana soldiers
                            of the 12th, 16th and 18th Regiments, transferred to the service of the
                            United States-asking for their pay by the State Paymaster for 585 days,
                            at thirteen dollars a month-amounting in the aggregate to $2,472
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, these claims were referred to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means, with instructions
                            that they be allowed, &c.

                        
                            ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                            The SPEAKER announced the consideration of Mr. Dunham's appeal.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH (by unanimous consent) said that this "sowing to the
                                wind" would "reap the whirlwind." He believed the action of the
                                minority this morning should be regarded as factious, and thought he
                                could assure the House for them, that if the resolution of the
                                gentleman from Jefferson were withdrawn, the minority side would
                                vote to take up and consider the bills indicated, in preference to
                                others.
                            Mr. DUNHAM disclaimed for himself any desire to obstruct legislation,
                                but could not forego rights and dignities of Representatives on this
                                floor, which could not be compromised.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH repealed his impression that if the resolution were
                                withdrawn the order of business would be suspended for the
                                consideration of all the business pressing upon us.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. Had it not been for this resolution, the General
                                Appropriation bill might ere this have received all the
                                consideration it would receive at this stage. The minority had
                                regarded the resolution as a stab at their rights. They even thought
                                that it should have been ruled out of order by the Chair, They might
                                be wrong. But it would be seen that the minority were not in a
                                condition now to yield anything on the question. Majorities could
                                afford to be magnanimous.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. It is simply a resolution to make certain bills a
                                special order. A motion and a resolution were tantamount to each
                                other.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. Was it not the purpose to take an order by a majority,
                                for which the rules require two-thirds?
                            Mr. NEWCOMB did not so understand it. It was simply to take the sense
                                of the House. It was not a change of the rules. It settles no
                                question of right, and about it there had been no concert, so far as
                                he knew.
                            Mr. HIGGINS objected to debate on the question of appeal.
                            The SPEAKER. Gentlemen had proceeded by unanimous consent.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB continued. Gentlemen say they want these bills to pass.
                                Their action did not look that way.
                            Mr. COFFROTH desired to ask the gentleman a question.
                            Mr. HIGGINS objected to interruption.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB continued to state the order, and deferred Mr. Branham's
                                resolution. The action of the minority was simply an objection to
                                the manner of doing business, preferred and selected by the
                                majority. There could be no question, he supposed, about the right
                                of the majority to guide and control the business of the House. He
                                discussed the rules 55 and 57, with reference to the order of
                                business, emphasizing the clause, "Unless when the House shall
                                direct otherwise." By the latter rule, bills of the House may be
                                taken up at the pleasure of the House. The House did not intend to
                                allow its business to go beyond its reach. They may take up House
                                bills and resolutions at the pleasure of the majority; though this
                                was not the case with reference to a proposition from the Senate. He
                                submitted then, that the action of the minority was contumatious.
                                When he had concluded--
                            Mr. DUNHAM rose to a privileged question. He moved that when the
                                House adjourns today, it shall be till Monday, 12 1/2 o'clock.
                            Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.
                            The SPEAKER. The matter was not debatable.
                            Mr. DUNHAM animadverted on the right of members to the floor.
                            Mr. BROWN asked to be excused from voting on the motion to fix the
                                time of adjournment.
                            Objection was made, and the yeas and nays were ordered on the motion
                                for excuse.
                            Mr. DUNHAM continued his animadversions.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, rising--
                            Mr. BROWN objected to interruptions while a gentleman holds the
                                floor.
                            Several members rising to order--
                            Mr. MILROY rising--
                            The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Carroll will sit down.
                            [Voices"Down," "down."]
                            Mr. BROWN. You have not got men enough, by God, to put anybody
                                down.
                            On motion by Mr. SHUEY these words of Mr. Brown were taken down by
                                the Clerk.
                            
                            Order being at length restored the House refuged to excuse Mr.
                                Brown--yeas 14, nays 51.
                            Before the vote was announced Mr. DUNHAM rose to a privileged
                                question, and asked whether he was recognized and recorded as
                                demanding the yeas and nays.
                            The SPEAKER. The Chair did not regard it as a privileged
                                question.
                            
                            Mr. BUSKIRK submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the pending resolution
                                            be referred to a select committee, to consist of Messrs.
                                            Branham, Newcomb, Dunham and Coffroth.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM. The matter is out of order pending the previous question,
                                demanded this morning by Mr. Branham.
                            The SPEAKER, It could not be entertained without unanimous
                                consent.
                            
                            Mr. MILROY submitted a motion that he be excused from voting on Mr.
                                Duriham's adjournment motion resulting yeas 17, nays 54.
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM submitted a motion to be excused, and the dilatory routine
                                resulted--yeas 17, nays 48.
                            Mr. BURWELL next submitted a motion to be excused from voting in the
                                same matter-resulting yeas 15 nays 51.
                            
                            Mr. SPENCER next submitted a motion to be excused from
                                voting--resulting--yeas 15, nays 46
                            
                            Mr. LEMON next submitted a motion to be excused from
                                voting--resulting--yeas 12, nays 41.
                            
                            Mr. THATCHER next submitted a motion to be excused-resulting-yeas 12,
                                nays 41.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, desired to know how long this thing could be
                                allowed to run?
                            [Voice: "Till the minority get their right?"]
                            Mr. BROWN. The gentleman is not in order. 
                            
                            Mr. BECKETT next submitted a motion to be excused from
                                voting-resulting-yeas 15, nays 48,
                            
                            Mr. HUNT next submitted a motion for excuse-resulting--yeas 12, nays
                                48.
                            
                            Mr. HARRISON next submitted a motion for excuse, resulting--yeas 9,
                                nays 40.
                            
                            Mr. BIRD next submitted a motion for excuse--yeas 13, nays 43.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. In order to relieve the monotony of these proceedings,
                                he asked for unanimous consent, move to take up the consideration of
                                the general appropriation bill, [H.
                                    R. No. 176]
                            Mr. BRANHAM objected.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair,) held that the motion could
                                not he entertained under the previous question, either with or
                                without unanimous consent.
                            
                            The question was then taken on Mr. Dunham's motion to fix Monday 12
                                1/2 o'clock as the time to which the House shall adjourn, and it was
                                rejected--yeas 16, nays 49.
                            Mr. BROWN submitted that when the House adjourn to-day it shall be
                                till Monday at 12 1/4 o'clock.
                            Mr. DUNHAM demanded the yeas and nays.
                            Mr. SPENCER submitted the dilatory motion for excuse.
                            Mr. DUNHAM objected, demanding the yeas and nays on the motion for
                                excuse.
                            
                            The House refused to excuse Mr. Spencer yeas--12, nays 51.
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM submitted the next dilatory motion, resulting, yeas 18,
                                nays 49.
                            Mr. BROWN moved the next dilatory motion.
                            Mr. ATKINSON. From the fact that there is not a quorum present, I
                                move that the House do now adjourn.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB insisted that no motion to adjourn can be entertained
                                pending the privileged motion of the gentleman from Jackson.
                            The SPEAKER, (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,) held that the point of
                                order is well taken. 
                            
                            The House refused to excuse Mr. Brown--yeas 16, nays 46.
                            Mr. MONTGOMERY submitted an order that the Doorkeeper procure 300
                                blank motions for excuses for the use of Democratic members.
                            The Speaker did not entertain the motion.
                            
                            Mr. HOWARD made the next motion to excuse-resulting yeas 15, nays
                                43.
                            Mr. BROWN submitted a motion that the gentleman from Delaware, (Mr.
                                Kilgore,) be excused from voting on the pending question; which he
                                immediately withdrew--Mr. K. disclaiming any desire to be
                                excused.
                            Mr. SPENCER proposed to amend the pending motion, so as to fix the
                                time at 12:20 P. M.
                            
                            Whereupon, he moved to be excused from voting-objection being made,
                                and the yeas and nays being demanded and ordered-the House refused
                                to excuse him--yeas 10, nays 43.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    

                                        Resolved, That the principal Clerk of
                                            the House be requested to keep aa accurate account of
                                            the stationery used by members for writing motions to be
                                            excused from voting, and that the value thereof be
                                            charged to their per diem account.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the Chair.) It was hardly necessary to
                                decide the resolution out of order.
                            
                            Mr. BECKETT submitted the next motion for excuse--resulting--yeas 14,
                                nays 43.
                            Mr. BROWN asked for unanimous consent to move to take up the General
                                Appropriation bill.
                            Mr. BRANHAM objected.
                            The question was then taken on Mr. Spencer's amendment to fix the
                                time at 12:20. 
                            
                            It was rejected--yeas 18, Days 39--and the question recurred on Mr.
                                Dunbam's order.
                            Mr. THACHER moved for unanimous consent to take up the General
                                Appropriation bill. 
                            Mr. BROWN proposed to amend the motion by including the two other
                                bills [H. R. 159, 140]
                                mentioned in Mr. Branham's resolution this morning.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) still ruled against all
                                motions not affecting the pending adjournment order.
                            
                            Mr. Brown's motion to adjourn till Monday, was rejected--yeas 16,
                                nays 48.
                            Mr. COFFROTH now asked for unanimous consent to take up the
                                Appropriation bill.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. The day bad been wasted and it was now too late to do
                                business.
                            Mr. PETTIT submitted that it were just as well to consent to the
                                adoption of the resolution. We had on the calendar about 200 bills,
                                except the Senate bills; and without such an order, every public
                                bill, and many men's favorite propositions were dependent on the
                                will of the minority. Nothing could be reached but by just such a
                                resolution as this adopted by a majority. He earnestly asked the
                                acquiescence of the minority in the desire of the House. 
                            Mr. BROWN submitted that the rights of the minority shall not be
                                disregarded by the majority.
                            
                            Mr. PETTIT It was not the right of the minority to resist the will of
                                the majority, but to bend it.
                             Mr. BROWN. Why then was it written in our rules that the order of
                                business shall not be postponed or changed, except by a vote of
                                two-thirds of the members present? 
                            Mr. PETTIT. Why was it written in the 57th rule that bills shall be
                                dispatched in the order in which they were introduced, unless when
                                the House shall direct otherwise?
                             Mr. BROWN respectfully objected to the gentleman's interpretation of
                                the words: "Unless the House shall direct otherwise." While he
                                respected the ability and learning of the gentleman from Wabash [Mr.
                                Pettit] he submitted that the House can direct nothing to be done,
                                unless in accordance with its rules framed under the Constitution;
                                and the rules say, that bill cannot be taken up out of its order,
                                except by a two-third's vote. And the House cannot direct otherwise
                                so long as that rule remains unchanged.
                            Mr. PETTIT. It was hardly necessary to enter upon this discussion.
                                And he appealed again to gentlemen to accede to the fair method
                                proposed by Mr. Branham's resolution in order that we may do
                                something.
                            Mr. COFFROTH remarked to the gentleman from Wabash, that the minority
                                cannot consent to vote for the resolution, for the reason that it
                                would be acquiescing in, and voting for what we believe to be
                                wrong--what we regard to be a violation of the rights of the
                                minority." Rules were made for the protection of minorities. If we
                                voted for the resolution now, we would be consenting and voting for
                                the same thing, to which we objected this morning as a wrong;
                                therefore, if we were sincere in our action, we can never consent to
                                that resolution; and hence it would be best, at once, to adopt his
                                motion. That would accomplish, in the ordinary method, everything
                                that could be acomplished by the passage of the resolution of the
                                gentleman from Jefferson. The minority thought the
                                resolution-infringed upon our rights-thought it a plan of the
                                majority, by which, if they thought proper, they could totally
                                defeat the rights of the minority, and refuse to take up any measure
                                which the minority might desire.
                            Mr. LASSELLE. By way of answer to the position taken by the gentlemen
                                from Wabash, requested the clerk so read the three first paragraphs
                                of Cushing's Manual--the best authority on this subject in the
                                United States. They were accordingly read by the clerk.
                             Mr. PETTIT could not see the aptness of the paragraphs read.
                            Mr. LASSELLE. They were to the point that rules are made for the
                                protection of minorities.
                            Mr. PETTIT could never understand that rules were made so, that
                                minorities can govern majorities. They were rather so made, that
                                majorities can pass any measure by force of their own numbers. But
                                here there was a clear majority in the House, yet we are utterly
                                powerless.
                            Mr. LASSELLE. But it was only under rules that minorities can have
                                rights.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Just what he was answering. The majority did not claim
                                that they could pass this resolution and make it effective by a
                                majority vote, at any other time than in the morning hour, when
                                resolutions, joint resolutions and bills are in order. He was
                                entirely mistaken, if the adoption of this resolution was not a good
                                method of relieving ourselves from the limbo into which we have got.
                                He simply desired that we may come upon some principle by which
                                these great public bills can be reached. He was satisfied that the
                                two constructions of the rules were held with equal sincerity on
                                both sides, whilst he submitted again that there was no encroachment
                                upon the rights of members on the other side in what had been
                                proposed, nor is there anything intended to impair the rights of the
                                minority. And, at the same time, he submitted that the minority
                                ought not to take all the power of the House into their own hands,
                                and hold the majority at their mercy.
                            It was a fixed principle with him, that where the people of a State,
                                by a clear majority, have elected and established a General
                                Assembly, the majority of that body should be allowed to make and
                                maintain its own policy, and that it does not belong to the
                                minority, as a right, either to endorse or interfere with the policy
                                which the majority may adopt. He had heard it suggested, that the
                                minority might rightfully delay and clog the power of legislation.
                                That was simply a mistaken estimate of privilege. The error was in
                                this: Instead of employing the rules as a shield, gentlemen were
                                using them as a weapon of offense against the majority. Now, when
                                the session was within six days of its conclusion-and these public
                                bills having each to be read some three times, on three several
                                days-it becomes a matter of some importance to get at them. And he
                                had understood that it was but day before yesterday, that the
                                minority here met in a convention of their own, and adopted a
                                resolution that they would not take up any measure by a suspension
                                of the rules.
                            Mr. COFFROTH rose to order. He submitted that it is not the privilege
                                of the gentleman to state what the minority have done outside. If
                                the minority has held a caucus, it was a secret session; and the
                                gentleman has no right to know what was done in it.
                            Mr. PETTIT. I submit to the ruling of the Chair.
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair regarded it as a delicate question.
                                Of course, all debate was out of order. But this was a sort of class
                                meeting, in which the Chair would indulge anything looking to an
                                accommodation of difficulties.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. Though it might be a class meeting, he feared that it
                                would not prove a love feast.
                            Mr. PETTIT had not intended, and did not now intend to be offensive
                                to any gentleman. But he had understood that the minority in caucus
                                had passed such a resolution; and he was surprised that they should
                                maintain such a general silence, if they can contradict it.
                            Mr. BUNHAM. It is not contradicted, simply for the reason that
                                gentlemen do not allow interruptions.
                            Mr. PETTIT. I will give way to the gentleman from Floyd.
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM had too much self-respect to take the floor by the
                                permission of the gentleman from Wabash.
                            Mr. PETTIT. When that fact was ascertained, the Chairman of the
                                    Committee on Ways and Means brought before
                                the House a resolution to bring forward these settlement and
                                appropriation bills which are to give life to the administration of
                                the State government for the next two years. And in the opposition
                                it had received to-day, he believed that the caucus resolution had
                                been adhered to. It was proposed in the form of a resolution, to
                                place these tills in an advanced position on the calendar: and he
                                had named this as the only means by which this could be done. But
                                now, is it known to be the purpose of the minority, if their will is
                                not observed, to repeat those dilatory forms which have proceeded
                                through this whole day, which are dishonorable to the State, and
                                cannot be remembered with pride.
                            Mr. DUNHAM rose to the point of order that the remarks of the
                                gentleman were in violation of the rules of the House; that the
                                language of the gentleman is not respectful, impugning the motives
                                of members, and the gentleman whose business it is to administer the
                                rules of the House ought not to be the first to depart from
                                them.
                            Mr. PETTIT. It was his purpose and feeling to avoid all embarrassing
                                remarks. We shall all think of these things at some future day; and
                                it cannot be anything but a fair question to look back upon this
                                day's work, and see if we can find anything in the business of this
                                day that is honorable to ourselves.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. So far as the gentleman from Wabash [Mr. Pettit] is
                                concerned the remark is doubtless true.
                            Mr. HUMPHREYS. If this day's proceedings are a disgrace, how do
                                gentleman sustain the action of the minority two years ago?
                                [Voice"Vote to pay them."
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentleman's question goes too far back
                                ]
                            Mr. PETTIT believed the question of history was pretty well
                                exhausted. But what were we to do. How support the Government? How
                                give encouragement to our men in the field and those now being
                                summoned thither? What revenues collected belonging to the civil and
                                military departments, and for the support of the benevolent
                                institutions? He submitted that when a proposition of this sort was
                                brought forward to consider bills absolutely essential to the
                                highest objects of administration, it must be an extreme
                                sensitiveness that can see any infringement of political rights.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK deprecated reflections on the past. "Sufficient unto the
                                day is the evil thereof." And let there be no further occasion for
                                complaint about want of courtesy. Let the minority aid the majority
                                in taking up what they regard as important, and let the majority aid
                                the minority in taking up what they desire to consider. He commended
                                the motion of Mr. Coffroth, and hoped it would be adopted.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Do I understand the gentleman to propose that the rules
                                shall be construed as we have proposed?
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. Not at all.
                            Mr. PETTIT. The difference is this: we want to have that done by a
                                majority, which they would require two-thirds to do. Now, if they
                                will come over and add their number to our majority, we can soon
                                have two-thirds.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. The only way to reach a bill standing behind, is to take
                                them all up on the calendar in order, one by one, and pass them by,
                                till you come to the bill that you desire to consider. The gentleman
                                from Wabash will recognize that as a practice of the highest
                                legislative authority in this country.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Just what I have stated in the morning hour, you can take
                                up anything by resolution.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. By no means; but you can take them up one by one, in
                                their order in the calendar.
                             Mr. PETTIT. There is no calendar in the morning hour. When the
                                calendar is reached and bills are called, then you can make a motion
                                to postpone or engross, because the proposition is up; and you can
                                postpone by a majority. It is the same principle which admits of
                                advancing bills in the morning hour by virtue of resolution.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. In my experience, I never knew a bill taken up out of
                                order by resolution. The only way of advancing bills that I ever
                                saw, is to lay aside bills as they come up, till you come to the
                                bill which the House desires to take up. You may search through the
                                legislation of the State of Indiana, or the Congress of the United
                                States, and you will never find where a bill has bean taken up by
                                resolution, and placed in advance on the calendar.
                            Mr. PETTIT would get at the principle. It is contended by the
                                gentleman from Monroe, that nothing can be taken up out of order,
                                but by a two-thirds vote.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. When a bill is reached in order, then a majority can
                                dispose of it; but it requires two-thirds to take it up out of
                                order.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Take our rule 57, which says bills shall be considered in
                                the order in which they were passed to the second reading. Here then
                                we have a bill introduced: one, two, three, four, to go--and you are
                                calling the calendar. The language of the rule is, these bills must
                                be "taken up and considered." But the gentleman says a bill may be
                                "postponed" by a majority, notwithstanding. The principle is, that a
                                majority can control the order of business by its vote, when the
                                proper time comes, and that it can be done just as well by
                                resolution in the morning hour, as by the interminable process
                                referred to by the gentleman it Floyd. But, Mr. Speaker, shall we
                                not get at this public business and do it?
                            It is not for ourselves exclusively that we are asking anything. It
                                is to secure a living administration of the finances of the
                                State--to maintain our public schools, and everything. Can't we
                                agree upon some plan upon which the action of the majority, these
                                bills may be taken up and acted on, before we shall be required to
                                adjourn, a week from Tuesday? He had no object in these remarks, but
                                to expedite business, and avoid the expense of an extra session.
                            
                            Mr. BRANHAM. Five different times he had asked the House--
                            Mr. DUNHAM demanded the order of business.
                             Mr. WRIGHT gave notice that on Monday he would move to so amend the
                                rules of the House as to fix the hours of meeting at nine o'clock A.
                                M. and two o'clock P. M., and of adjournment at 12 1/2 P. M. and 5
                                P. M., and so that no motion to adjourn, nor any privileged motion
                                shall be in order in the hours of business mentioned.
                             Mr. BROWN and other Democratic members rose and objected to the
                                notice.
                             Mr. COFFROTH insisted on the consideration of his motion to take up
                                the General Appropriation bill.
                             Mr. BRANHAM objected.
                            And then--at 6:10 P. M.--
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the House adjourned till Monday morning at
                                9 o'clock.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        MONDAY, February 27, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                     The reading of the journal of Saturday's proceedings was commenced,
                        when-
                    On motion by Mr. MILLIGAN, the further reading thereof was dispensed
                        with.
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES
                        
                        Were submitted, recommending the passage of the bill S. 175 (see page 283
                            of the BREVIER REPORTS,) and that Senate bills 96 (page 110,) 131 (page
                            156) 166 and (page 248) be laid on the table.
                        The Committee on Claims recommended the allowance of
                            the following accounts.
                        
                            J. H Rees, for coal furnished Committee rooms,

                        Which reports were severally concurred in.
                    
                    
                        FEDERAL RELATIONS.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, arose to introduce a joint resolution, in a series
                            of paragraphs, upon the subject of the Federal relation of the States
                            and the existing National difficulties. It will be readily perceived
                            that they are not new nor original, but, are old as the foundations of
                            our Government,. The inquiry arises, what is expected to be accomplished
                            by introducing this resolution at this late day in the session? If
                            nothing more, I reply, the discharge of a duty to the constituency I
                            represent upon this floor.
                        It is an exhibition of great temerity, I am aware, but at the risk of
                            inciting a sneer of contempt from the Senator from Boone, [Mr. Cason,] a
                            sigh of pity from the Senator from Marion, [Mr. Thompson,] a smile of
                            ridicule from the Senator from Fayette, [Mr. Bennett,] or of receiving a
                            friendly admonition from the Senator from Monroe, [Mr. Dunning,] the
                            political Gamaliel at whose feet I sat during the last session;
                            notwithstanding all this, a sense of duty more controlling than this
                            impels me to offer the following joint resolution, a joint resolution
                            [S. 18,] upon the subject of the Federal relations of the States, the
                            existing national difficulties, and matters properly connected
                            therewith:
                        
                            
                                
                                    WHEREAS, A frequent recurrence to
                                        fundamental principles is, at all times, and more
                                        particularly in times of great civil commotion, absolutely
                                        necessary to the preservation of popular liberty, and is the
                                        surest safeguard against the danger of degeneracy to which
                                        Republics are liable; therefore,
                                    
                                         Be it Resolved by the General
                                                Assembly of the State of Indiana, That this
                                            General Assembly doth unequivocally express a firm
                                            resolution to maintain and tie end the Constitution of
                                            the United States and the Constitution of this State
                                            against every aggression, foreign or domestic; and that
                                            they will support the Government of the United States in
                                            all measures warranted by the former.
                                         That this General Assembly most solemnly
                                            declares a warm attachment to the Union of the States,
                                            to maintain which it pledges its powers; and that for
                                            this end it is their duty to watch over and oppose every
                                            infraction of those principles which constitute the only
                                            basis of that Union, because a faithful observance of
                                            them can alone secure its existence and the public
                                            happiness.
                                         That this General Assembly doth explicitly
                                            assert that the several States composing the United
                                            States are not united on the principle of unlimited
                                            submission to their General Government; that the powers
                                            of said General Government are limited by the plain
                                            sense and intention of the Constitution of the United
                                            States, and the additions and amendments thereto, and
                                            are no farther valid than they are authorized by the
                                            grants enumerated in that instrument, its additions and
                                            amendments, and that in case of a deliberate, palpable
                                            and dangerous exercise of other powers net granted
                                            therein, the States who are parties thereto, have the
                                            right and are in duty bound to interpose for arresting
                                            the progress of the evil and for maintaining within
                                            their respective limits the authorities, rights and
                                            liberties appertaining to them.
                                         That this General Assembly doth also express
                                            its deep regret that a spirit has, in sundry instances,
                                            been manifested by the Federal Government to enlarge its
                                            powers by forced constructions of the said Constitution,
                                            additions and amendments, and also, by the adoption,
                                            under cover of terms created to suit its own purposes,
                                            of other powers entirely unknown in that instrument; all
                                            tending directly and inevitably to subvert the
                                            sovereignty of the States, to destroy the Federal
                                            character of the Union and to rear on its ruins a
                                            consolidated military despotism without constitutional
                                            check or limitation, resulting necessarily in the loss
                                            of liberty itself.
                                        
                                             That this general assembly, among the many
                                                unauthorized acts of the Federal Government doth
                                                particularly protest against the acts below set
                                                forth as palpable and alarming infractions of the
                                                Constitution, to-wit:
                                            The suspension of the writ of habeas corpus by the
                                                President and the subsequent delegation to him by
                                                Congress of the power to do so.
                                            The declaring of martial law over States not in
                                                rebellion, and where the civil courts were open and
                                                unobstructed for the punishment of crime.
                                            The establishment of a system of espionage for the
                                                invasion of the sacred privacy of unsuspecting
                                                citizens.
                                            The arrest, at the touch of a bell, of citizens not
                                                subject to military law; incarcerating them without
                                                charge or accusation; denying them the right of
                                                trial in the civil courts and by jury, and
                                                subjecting them to trial by tribunals responsible
                                                only to arbitrary power.
                                            The dismemberment of the State of Virginia, and the
                                                erection within her boundaries of a new State
                                                without the consent of her Legislature.
                                            The subversion of the governments of certain States,
                                                and the erection within their limits of other
                                                governments essentially different, and this either
                                                wholly by means of military power, or in accordance
                                                with the will of a minority of only one-tenth of the
                                                electors of such States, such will being procured,
                                                directed and controlled by military power.
                                            The interference with the reserved rights, and with
                                                the domestic institutions of the States by
                                                Presidential proclamation; by Congressional
                                                enactment, and by additions to the Constitution of
                                                the United States entirely outside the scope of that
                                                instrument. 
                                                The abridgment of the freedom of speech and of the
                                                press, by arbitrarily arresting citizens for the
                                                expression of opinion; by establishing a censorship
                                                of the press, and by suppressing newspapers or
                                                restricting their circulation by military power.
                                            The interference with the great right of free
                                                suffrage by open military force, or by prescribing
                                                to electors test oaths, supported by military
                                                force.
                                        
                                        6. That this General Assembly doth lastly declare that
                                            it views the existing evils of the country as
                                            presenting; but two alternatives for their
                                            determination, consistent with the maintenance of the
                                            territorial unity of the States;the one a convention of
                                            the States upon the principles and views embodied in the
                                            foregoing resolutions, which must result in restoring
                                            those feelings of mutual interest and good will which
                                            had previously characterized the United States; the
                                            other is a military subjugation of the so-called
                                            Confederate States, which must result in an absolute
                                            military despotism, or at best a mixed monarchy.
                                        7. That the Governor of this State bs and he is hereby
                                            authorized and requested to communicate the preceding
                                            resolutions, to the Governors and Legislatures of the
                                            several States, and the Senators and Representatives of
                                            this State in Congress, and to assure them that the
                                            people of Indiana feel the most sincere affection for
                                            their brethren of the other States; the truest anxiety
                                            for perpetuating the Union of all, and the most
                                            scrupulous fidelity to the Constitution of the United

                                            to the like dispositions in other States, and doth trust
                                            that they will affirm the principles embodied in the
                                            foregoing resolutions, protest against the infractions
                                            of the Federal Constitution therein set forth, and take
                                            all proper measures for co-operating with this State in
                                            maintaining, unimpaired, the authorities, rights and
                                            liberties reserved to the States respectively, or to the
                                            people, and in endeavoring to procure such adjustment of
                                            our existing national difficulties, upon the principles
                                            embodied in the foregoing resolutions, as will insure a
                                            restoration of the Union with all the dignity, equality
                                            and rights of the several States unimpaired.

                        $800 EXEMPTION.

                        Mr. MARSHALL introduced a joint resolution [S. 19,] instructing our
                            Senators and requesting our Representatives in Congress to favor
                            amendment to the conscription law, so as to require $800 to be paid by
                            conscientious exempts, which was read the first time and passed to a
                            second reading.

                        Mr. ALLISON introduced a bill" [S.
                                190,] providing for the completion of any unfinished. business
                            of any. regular session of the General Assembly by the next succeeding
                            extra session of the same General Assembly, and declaring an emergency
                            [declaring that the unfinished business of the regular shall be
                            transferred to the calendar of the special session in the same order,
                            and be considered and disposed of in the same manner as it might hare
                            been considered and disposed of at the regular session, subject to such
                            changes in the rules as either House may see proper to make.] The
                            constitutional prevision was suspended and the bill was read the second
                            time and referred to the Judiciary Committee.
                    
                    
                        ROAD VIEWERS--INCREASE OF PAY.

                        Mr. PEDEN introduced a bill [S. 191,] entitled an act to amend sections
                            16 and 47 of an act entitled an act to provide for the opening, vacating
                            and change of highways, approved June 17, 1852; which was read the first
                            time.
                        As the law now stands viewers, appointed to lay out or change any road,
                            are compelled to proceed on the same day on which they are notified to
                            meet and organize without regard to the condition of the weather or
                            other attending circumstances. This bill proposes to so change the law
                            as to allow the view to meet, organize and adjourn, or proceed as
                            circumstances may dictate, so they report before the next meeting of the
                            county board. The bill further proposes to amend section 47 so as to
                            allow $2 per day instead of $[1?] as compensation to viewers of roads
                            for their services.
                        
                         The constitutional provision was dispensed with, and the bill was read
                            the second and third times under the dispensation, and finally passed
                            the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.

                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS the bill H. R.
                                20, (see page 64 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS,) was read
                            the first time and passed to the second reading.
                    
                    
                        CUSHING'S MANUAL FOR THE SENATE.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING it was-
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Committee on
                                            Finance be instructed to allow James G.
                                        Bryant, six dollars and fifty cents, for one copy of
                                        Cushing's Manual, furnished for the use of the Senate at its
                                        present session, and that said committee place the same in
                                        the specific Appropriation Bill.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        THE LIQUOR LAW.
                        Mr. PEDEN presented two petitions praying for a law effectually
                            suppressing the sale of intoxicating liquors within the State, which
                            were referred to the Committee on Temperance.
                    
                    
                        RELIEF FOR THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN
                        On motion by Mr. CULVER, the regular order of business, was suspended and
                            the bill H. R. 14, (see pages,
                            142, 143, 144 and 145 of these Reports ) was read the second time.
                        On motion by Mr. VAWTER the Secretary was ordered to incorporate in his
                            journal of Thursday the amendments made by the Committee of the
                                Whole. 
                        Mr. MOORE moved to amend by striking out "three" and insert "two" mills
                            tax on the $100 valuation.
                        On motion by Mr. CULVER the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 38,
                            nays 3. 
                        Mr. OYLER asked a reconsideration of the Senate amendments to that bill
                            that it may pass the Senate and become a law. Gentlemen understood the
                            state of affairs in the other end of the Capitol, and it needs no
                            argument to urge upon. Senators the importance of this suggestion.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS advised delay for a day or two at least.
                        Mr. OYLER, If we delay this bill now it may be delayed till too late to
                            go to the Governor and be returned within the time limited by the
                            Constitution.
                        Mr. CULVER moved to reconsider the vote of the Senate concurring in the
                            amendments of the Committee of the Whole to the
                            fourth section, striking out the words "or any substitute."
                        Mr. WILLIAMS spoke against this motion. He objected most strenuously to
                            making any such unjust discrimination against the families of
                            substitutes.
                        Mr. OYLER submitted the proposition whether it is advisable to insist on
                            this  amendment and thus probably
                            lose the bil. He undertook to say at this stage of the session that we
                            have got to pass it as came from the House or lose the whole law. 
                        Mr. WILLIAMS had known bills to be introduced on Friday and passed before
                            Saturday night.
                        Mr. NILES knew not why substitutes were not as much entitled to our
                            gratitude as other men in the service, and surely the substitute's
                            family are entitled to support at our hands. He would not believe but
                            that there would be a chance for this bill to pass the House of
                            Representatives yet with the Senate amendments added.
                         Mr. THOMPSON questioned whether it would not be better to have no bill
                            at all on this subject than to cast this approbrium upon soldier
                            substitutes.
                         Mr. PEDEN went cut to one of the camps the other day and met almost the
                            whole of his company which had followed him three years,and they were
                            there as substitutes. They have families at home, and could gentlemen
                            ask him to cast a vote disfranchising from the benefits of this bill the
                            families of those brave men? If so, it is what he would not do. He would
                            vote against the whole bill before he would cast such a vote. His
                            constituents would damn him for all time to come were he to give such a
                            vote. In fact, he would be ashamed to cast such a vote. A large
                            proportion of the men now going as substitutes have served in the army
                            for three years, and some for three years and three months, and the idea
                            that their families should be cut out of the provisions of this bill is
                            simply ridiculous, and it is a disgrace to men who talk about voting for
                            it.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill
                            till Wednesday next, at nine o'clock A. M.
                        Mr. CORBIN opposed postponement. The quicker this bill is acted upon and
                            sent to the House the better, if it is intended to pass it this session.
                            la the main he opposed the bill, but it was upon his motion that the
                            amendment was made to it that is now proposed to be stricken out. If
                            there were not more than a half dozen substitutes incur army, the
                            principle would be wrong to exclude them from the provisions of this
                            bill; but as there are now a great many men going into the service as
                            substitutes, is it possible that it is proposed to exclude them from the
                            benefits of this bill? It would create much better feeling to have no
                            bill at all, than to have one with this discrimination in it. His
                            position had been that we needed no bill of this kind; but if he were a
                            friend of the bill, he should urge immediate action here, in order that
                            it might be sent to the House. It would not take the House a great while
                            to concur. He had no idea that the House would sit there and call the
                            yeas and nays far eight or ten days; and the sooner this bill is sent
                            down there, the better will be its chances for becoming a law.
                        Mr. TERRY would much prefer that the measure fall to the ground than to
                            have substitutes' families deprived of the benefits proposed to be
                            conferred by this bill. Many of these substitutes make the best soldiers
                            we have, and their families should receive all the rights, privileges
                            and immunities of any other soldiers' families. He had reason to believe
                            that there are friends enough to soldiers' families in the other end of
                            the capital to concur in the Senate amendments to this bill.
                        Mr. ALLISON was extremely anxious that this amendment should be made upon
                            the bill, and should vote for the motion to postpone, with the hope of
                            making such terms with the other end of the capital as to get these
                            amendments through.
                        
                        The motion to postpone was agreed to by yeas 28, nays 14.
                    
                    
                        WHITE-WATER VALLEY CANAL.
                        Mr. COBB moved that the bill H. R. 59 [see page 262 of these Reports.] be
                            considered as before the Senate and read the second time.
                        Mr. OYLER suggested that such a motion was not in order. The motion
                            should be first to suspend the rules.
                        Mr. THOMPSON. If we approach this bill there will be enacted similar
                            scenes to those we had here on Friday and Saturday. Will it not be best
                            to let this bill rest and go on with more important measures? He was
                            friendly to the bill, but did not believe it in the power of the
                            majority to do anything if you adopt the rule they have in the other
                            House.
                        VOICES-"We won't do that,"
                        Mr. OYLER. This whole difficulty can be obviated if they will only give
                            the minority a chance or opportunity of offering a few reasonable
                            amendments to that bill.
                        Mr. COBB. That is the very object of getting the bill up now, to let
                            these amendments be presented. He modified his motion so as to suspend
                            the order of business for the purpose of taking up the bill H. R.
                            59.
                        Mr. CULLEN. It is something strange and unheard of that this Senate
                            should suspend business, of vastly more importance to the State for the
                            purpose of taking up a bill of this kind. He appealed to Senators to say
                            whether the wheels of legislation shall be stopped whether shall they be
                            clogged by the power of any corporation in the State.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, called the Senator to order under rule 10 of the
                            Senate.
                        The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR decided the point of order to be well taken.
                        Then followed a series of dilatory motions by Messrs. RICHMOND, CULLEN,
                            BONHAM and CORBIN, such as to lay on the table, to reconsider, to call
                            the roll, to adjourn, besides many other motions that were decided to be
                            out of order by the Chair.
                        Mr. ALLISON demanded the previous question Twenty-six Senators seconded
                            the demand.
                        The main question was ordered by yeas 32, nays 8, as follows:

                                        Brown, of Wells, Cason, Cobb, Culver, Davis, Downey,
                                        Dunning, Dykes, English, Fuller, Gaff, Gifford, Hanna,
                                        Hyatt, Jenkius, Marshall, Mason, Milligan, Moore, Newlin,
                                        Oyler, Staggs, Thompson, Van Buskirk, Vawter, Ward, Williams
                                        and Wright32.
                                    NAYS-Messrs. Beeson, Bonham, Corbin, Cullen, Finch, Noyes,
                                        Richmond, and Terry,8.
                                
                            
                        
                        Then came another series of motions similar to those enumerated above, by
                            Messrs. RICHMOND, OYLER, CULLEN, CORBIN and BEESON. 
                        
                        
                        The yeas and nays being demanded and taken on a motion to dispense with
                            further proceedings, under the call resulted+-yeas 29, nays 3.
                        It was announced that there was not a quorum voting whereupon--
                        
                        Mr. BEESON made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--affirmative 12, nays
                            16.
                        On motion by Mr. VAWTER it was ordered that the absentees be sent
                            for.
                        Subsequently Messrs. RICHMOND, CULLEN and OYLER appeared in their
                            seats.
                        The roll call on the motion to adjourn was proceeded with when one other
                            Senator voteds
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved that further proceedings under the order to send
                            for absentee, be dispersed with.
                        Mr. CORBIN moved to lay that motion on the table.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK withdrew it.
                        
                        Then the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR announced that the Senate had agreed to
                            dispense with further proceedings under the call-stating the vote to be
                            yeas 30, nays 3, present and not voting 3.
                        The question recurring on the motion to take up the bill H. R. 59.
                        The yeas and nays were taken--yeas 29, nays 3--when
                        It was announced that there was not a quorum voting.
                        Messrs. Niles and Thompson plead ill health, and left the chamber.
                        The absentees were sent far.
                        Subsequently Messrs, Cullen and Wood appeared in their seats.
                        
                        The roll call was proceeded with, and the Lieutenant Governor announced
                            that the motion was adopted by yeas 29, nays 3, and two Senators
                            present, but not voting.
                        Mr. CORBIN demanded a recount.
                        
                        Mr. CULLEN moved to adjourn--yeas 8, nays 23--no quorum voting.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered, and 19 Senators were reported absent, to-wit:
                        Messrs. Bennett, Bonham, Bradley, Carson, Chapman, Cullen, Culver,
                            Douglas, Dykes, Hord, McClurg, Niles, Noyes, Oyler, Peden, Richmond,
                            Thompson, Woods and Wright--19.
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, their names were ordered to be noted on the
                            journals.
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, further proceedings under the call were
                            dispensed with.
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        MONDAY, February 27, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock A. M , and directed the roll call to
                        determine a quorum.
                    Mr. HIGGINS moved to dispense with the reading of the journal of
                        yesterday.
                    Mr. BROWN objected.
                    Mr. COFFROTH suggested that the yeas and nays may only be omitted in the
                        reading.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. The material part of the journal which he desired to be assured
                        of, was the second to the previous question, and the ordering of the main
                        question on the resolution of the gentleman from Jefferson.
                    The reading wag suspended on a division-affirmative 40, negative 26. 
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted, in writing a protest on the part of members of
                            the minority of the House of Representatives, against certain
                            proceedings of yesterday.
                        The SPEAKER ruled it out of order.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS submitted a temperance memorial from the mothers, wives and
                            sisters of sundry citizens of Henry county, which was referred to the
                                Committee on Temperance.
                        Mr. COFFROTH rose to a privilege question, presenting the same paper as
                            before, and asked that it be read and spread on the journal.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair has already ruled it out of order at this
                            time.
                        Mr. COFFROTH read from the Constitution a section (26) which led him to
                            think that it stands as a privilege question, and as such can be
                            submitted at any time.
                        The SPEAKER. When the House, by its rules, have made the order for
                            petitions, there can be no higher privilege than presenting
                            petitions.
                        Mr. LASSELLE suggested that the paper was in the nature of a
                            petition.
                        Mr. SPEAKER. A petition is addressed to the House, asking that something
                            be done. This, the Chair understands, is a protest against the action of
                            the House.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
                        Mr. GREGORY, from a majority of the Committee on Education, returned Mr.
                            Buskirk's bill [H. R. No. 6,] providing for the acceptance of Congress
                            lands, donated by the act of July 6, 1862, to the State for the
                            endowment of an Agricultural College, and locating the same at
                            Bloomington, Monroe county-reporting generally on the several
                            propositions for donations to secure the location of said college at
                            Stockwell, at Richmond, and at the Tippecanoe Battle Ground, and
                            accepting the donation by Joseph Cooper, Chauncey Jones, and others, for
                            the location of that institution at the latter place, and reporting a
                            bill accordingly. The report submits that the act of Congress, which was
                            approved July 2, 1862, provides that the State accepting its provisions
                            shall establish said college within five years, or the grant shall
                            cease, &c. That limitation expires July 2, 1867. Hence they believe
                            it will be unwise to postpone the establishment of such a college beyond
                            the present session of the General Assembly.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS, on the part of the minority of said committee, reported
                            non-concurrece as to the location of the college, recommending an
                            amendment of the bill reported by the majority so as to accept of the
                            donation from Richmond, in Wayne county, and locate college at that
                            place; and when so amended they recommended the passage of the bill. The
                            minority report submits considerations at length for preference of the
                            Richmond location. Mr. BUSKIRK asked and obtained leave of time till
                            to-morrow morning for the gentleman from Owen [Mr. Stuckey.] to make
                            another minority report.
                         Mr. HAMRICK moved that the reports lie on the table.
                        
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved to make the subject a special order for
                            Wednesday.
                        The SPEAKER. If there was no motion sending for a special order, the
                            motion would be in order.
                        Mr. COFFROTH now again presented the minority protest.
                        The SPEAKER held that it would not be in order till the House should
                            reach the order of resolutions and bills.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, returned and
                            recommended the claim of Jos. E. McDonald--that it be incorporated into
                            the specific bill for payment.
                    
                    
                        THE SUPREME AUTHORITY.
                        Mr. REESE, from the special committee on constitutional amendments,
                            returned the petition of Calvin Fletcher, Sr., and four hundred other
                            Christian gentlemen--(see page 257 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE
                            REPORTS)--a majority of said committee recommending amendments to the
                            Constitution of the State in accordance with the suggestions of the
                            memorialists. The committee reason for these amendments that they
                            contain nothing but the suggestions of a pure Christian patriotism; 2.
                            That they are in harmony with our system of government; 3. That they
                            harmonize our form of government with the Christian Institution; 4. By
                            adopting these amendments we shall propitiate the favor of Him who
                            chasteneth nations for national sins, &c.
                        Mr. LASSELLE on the part of the minority of said committee. (Mr. Harrison
                            and himself,) submitted a report reasoning at length in opposition to
                            the propriety of the proposed amendments, and recommending that the
                            petition be laid on the table.
                    
                    
                        HON. JOSEPH E M'DONALD.
                        A message was received from the Governor, by the hand of Mr. Salgrove,
                            his Private Secretary, and
                        The SPEAKER directed that It be read by the Clerk.
                        The message communicates the report of the Hon. Jos. E. McDonald,
                            appointed to investigate certain fraudulent certificates of Indiana five
                            per cent. stocks, and to procure their cancellation and surrender.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, as the communication suggests legislation, moved that 300
                            copies be printed.
                        It was so ordered.
                    
                    
                        ORDER OF BUSINESS--PROTEST.
                        The SPEAKER stated that the consideration of the order of unfinished
                            business, viz: Mr. Branham's resolution of yesterday for taking up House
                            bills 176, 153 and 140, and making them a special order,the amendment
                            thereto, the previous question having been demanded and seconded by the
                            House, and the main question having been ordered.
                        The pending question hereunder being on Mr. Dunham's appeal from the
                            decision of the Chair that a motion to reconsider an adjournment cannot
                            be entertained.
                        Mr. COFFROTH (by unanimous consent) then submitted the following:
                        
                            PROTEST OF THE MINORITY.
                        
                         Mr. SPEAKER: The undersigned, representing the minority upon the floor
                            of the House, beg leave to express their regret at the action of the
                            majority of the House in their attempt to strike down the rights of the
                            minority, and the consequent impending necessary legislation: and also
                            most respectfully, yet earnestly and solemnly to protest against it. And
                            to to this end we beg to submit the following facts:
                        On the morning of Saturday, February 25th, and while petitions were being
                            presented, (no other business being in order except by consent of
                            two-thirds of the House,) the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Branham,)
                            offered the following resolution:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That House bills Nos. 176, 153
                                        and 140 be made the special order at 10 1/2 o'clock to-day,
                                        (February 25th )
                                
                            
                        
                        This resolution, although clearly out of order, was entertained by the
                            Speaker, (Mr. Pettit.) whereupon, objection being made, it was ruled out
                            of order.--Shortly afterwards, resolutions, &c, being called for,
                            the same resolution was again offered by the gentleman from
                            Jefferson.
                        Objection was at once made to it because it was a proposition indirectly
                            to suspend the order of business by a bare majority vote, when, by the
                            rules of the House, it required two-thirds. But the objection made and
                            the points of order raised were summarily overruled by the Speaker.
                        The Rules of the House on this subject are as follows :
                        "Rule 55. After the House has disposed of the business specified in Rule
                            53, the Speaker shall proceed to dispose of the business on his table
                            and the orders of the day in the following manner, viz:
                        "1st. Messages from the Senate containing amendments proposed by the
                            Senate to bills of the House.
                        "2d. Bills and resolutions from the Senate on their first and second
                            reading, that they be referred to committees and put under way.
                        "3d. Engrossed bills and bills from the Senate on their third
                            reading.
                        "4th. Bills of the House on their engrossment, or on being ordered to a
                            third reading, shall be taken up and considered in the order of times in
                            which they passed to a second reading.
                        "Rule 57. Every bill and joint resolution shall be introduced on the
                            report of a committee, or by motion for leave, and shall be dispatched
                            in the order in which they were introduced, unless when the House shall
                            direct otherwise.
                        Rule 63. No standing rule or order of the House shall be rescinded or
                            changed without one day's notice being given of the motion thereof. Nor
                            shall any rule be suspended, except by a vote of at least two-thirds of
                            the members present. Nor shall the order of business, as established by
                            the rules of the House, be postponed or changed except by a vote of at
                            least two-thirds of the members present."
                        As we have already stated, it was, in effect a motion to suspend the
                            regular order of business, which as will be observed by rule 63, cannot
                            be done except by a two-thirds vote; and yet this being a mere
                            resolution, it could be adopted by a bare majority, and thereby it was
                            proposed to accomplish indirectly what could not be done by direct
                            action.
                        Should the undersigned consent to this it would at once establish a
                            precedent whereby the majority could at any and all times set aside any
                            and all measures proposed or introduced by any of the minority, however
                            early it might stand upon the calendar or however meritorious it might
                            be in point of fact; whilst the majority could at any and all times take
                            up, and pass any measure, however late it might be on the calendar, or
                            obnoxious to the minority-denying them all time for consideration or
                            legitimate action.
                        Rules, like constitutions, are made for the protection of minorities,
                            because majorities do not need them, for without them they can always,
                            by force of numbers, protect themselves. We cheerfully concede that
                            minorities have no right (except in self defence) to impede legislation
                            by factious opposition, yet they do have the undoubted right to insist
                            that legislation shall proceed in its legitimate course, and according
                            to the rules prescribed. Says Mr. Onslow, one of the ablest ot the
                            speakers of the British House of Commons: 
                        
                        "It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, from old and
                            experienced members, that nothing tended more to throw power into the
                            hands of the administration and those who acted with the majority of the
                            House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from the rules of
                            proceeding; that these forms as instituted by our ancestors, operated as
                            a check, and controlled the actions of the majority, and that they were,
                            in many instances, a shelter and protection to the minority, against the
                            attempts of power."
                        Said Mr Jefferson:
                        "So far the maxim is certainly true, and is founded in good sense, that
                            as it is always in the power of the majority, by their numbers, to stop
                            any improper measures proposed on the part of their opponents the only
                            weapons by which the minority can defend themselves against similar
                            attempts from those in power, are the forms and rules of proceeding
                            which have been adopted as they were found necessary from time to time,
                            and are become the law of the House; by a strict adherence to which the
                            weaker party can only be protected f om those irregularities and abuses
                            which these forms were intended to check, and which the wantonness of
                            power is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful
                            majorities.
                        "And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not is
                            really not of so great importance. It is much more material there should
                            be a rule to go by than what that rule is; that there may be a
                            uniformity, a proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the
                            Speaker or the captiousness of the members. It is very material that
                            order, decency and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body.
                            (2 Hats. 849; Jefferson's Manual, pages 13 to 14.
                        But the majority of the House, overlooking the fact that these rules,
                            being in pari materia, must, for the purpose of
                            interpretation, be considered together; they therefore refer us to Rule
                            57 alone, and insist that by the words "unless the House shall direct
                            otherwise," the whole legislation is at their mercy. Yet, is not its
                            plain meaning, when we consider it in connection with Rule 63, that the
                            House shall not direct otherwise, except pursuant to its rules, which
                            require a two-thirds vote, or (as in the course in Congress, that where
                            a measure is reached in its order it may be passed over by a majority,
                            and which of itself does not involve a suspension of the order of
                            business. The rule in Congress upon this subject (No. 127,) is precisely
                            the same as Rule 63 [See Jefferson's Maual. page 161.
                        And we know of no precedent analagous to the present proposed action of
                            the majority, in the legislation of Congress since the adaption of said
                            rule; nor of any in the legislation of Indiana. But if it is still
                            claimed that the rule 57 warrants a different construction, then we
                            insist that it is in conflict with rule 63, which being the last
                            expressed will of the House whom the subject must govern. But as the
                            majority still insist upon this alleged unnecessary and hurtful
                            proceeding, the only result of which, so far, has been to stop the usual
                            course of legislation, we most respectfully submit that the minority
                            must not-nay, cannot yield. It would be wrongful to themselves, and not
                            permanently advantageous to the present majority.
                        The undersigned still further protest that it is not now nor has it been
                            their purpose to delay or prevent any rightful or necessary legislation,
                            but simply to defend their inherent and constitutional rights. This was
                            evidenced on five several occasions curing last Saturday, and while the
                            obnoxious resolution was pending, where members of the minority asked
                            the unanimous consent of the House to pass it over and to take up the
                            appropriation bills, but at each time were defeated by the opposition of
                            gentlemen of the majority-and that, notwithstanding said rebuffs, they
                            are yet willing to renew at any time such proposition or to accede to it
                            as a proposition from the majority.
                        In conclusion the undersigned beg leave to say that they are now, and
                            indulge the hope that they ever will be, ready and willing to co-operate
                            with the majority in all legitimate legislation, and that if it fails,
                            the responsibility must rests as it should do, with the majority.

                        The protest was read, and will go as upon the journal.
                        Mr. COFFROTH said that there were other gentlemen of the minority who
                            would like to sign the protest, and he moved that they have leave to do
                            so as they shall come in.
                        The SPEAKER. No motion is in order. We are under stress of the previous
                            question. The Chair again stated the question to be on Mr. Dunham's
                            appeal from the decision taken Saturday, to-wit: Shall the decision of
                            the Chair stand as the judgment of the House?--the yeas and nays having
                            been ordered thereon.
                        Mr. BROWN asked to be excused from voting on the question of appeal.
                        Mr. COFFROTH objected.
                        The SPEAKER ruled the motion to be excused as out of order on an
                            appeal.
                        Mr. BROWN. Is the ruling of Saturday to be reversed?
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair is under the impression that such was the ruling
                            of Saturday, but the record will be examined. Upon examination, the
                            Chair finds the record as stated by the gentleman from Jackson. 
                        
                        Mr. DUNHAM and Mr. SPENCER demanded the yeas and nays, and the same being
                            ordered and taken resulted yeas 18, nays 49.
                        So the House refused to excuse Mr. Brown.
                        
                        Mr. SPENCER followed with a motion for excuse-and the House refused to
                            excuse him by yeas 12, nays 44.
                        The question then recurring on Mr. Dunham's appeal--the yeas and nays
                            resulted--yeas 41, nays 28, as follows:

                                        Coffroth, Croan, Dunham, Glazebrook, Hargrove, Howard,
                                        Humphreys, Hunt, Lasselle, Lemon, Lopp, Miller of Clinton,
                                        Milroy, O'Brien, 
                                        Osborn, Perigo, Richards, Richardson, Roach, Shoaff of
                                        Allen, Shoaff of Jay, Spencer, and Stuckey--28.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of the House.
                        The question then recurred on the adoption of Mr. Branham's resolution.
                            [The reporter does not know what became of Mr. Brown's amendment
                            thereto.]
                        Mr. BROWN moved for unanimous consent that the pending amendment be
                            indefinitely postponed, in order to take up House bills 176, 153 and 140: an
                        Objection being made--
                        The SPEAKER ruled that such a motion would be out of order.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the House do now adjourn, demanding the yeas and
                            nays thereon. And there was a second of 10 members.
                        Mr. BUNHAM moved that when the. House adjourns to-day it shall be till
                            Tuesday, 9 o'clock A.M.
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays thereon.
                        The SPEAKER decided that 10 members did not rise to second the
                            demand.
                        Mr. BROWN. Has not the Chair ruled, that two members were sufficient to
                            second a motion to adjourn to a time certain ?
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair decides now that that is not a privilege
                            question.
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted, in writing, his motion to be excused from voting
                            on the pending question.
                        Mr. DUNHAM objected: and Messrs. Brown and Dunham demanded the yeas and
                            nays; and they were ordered.
                        Mr. HENRICKS rose to a question of order, and submitted the following,
                            which was read by the Clerk:
                        Section 12 of art. 4 of the Constitution, provides, that "the yeas and
                            nays of any question, shall, at the request of any two members, be
                            embodied, together with the names of the members demanding me same, on
                            the journal." The subject of this article being legislative, the term
                            question must mean a legislative question, or a question having some
                            relation or connection with the subject of legislation. The mere request
                            to be excused from voting, and especially to be excused from voting on a
                            motion to adjourn, which of itself is only to determine when the House
                            shall be in session, and has no reference to what it shall be, cannot be
                            regarded as a legislative question under the Constitution, unless we
                            admit that the framer of that instrument intended to place it in the
                            power of a few members of the House to stop all legislation, by
                            consuming the time of the House in calling the yeas and nays on
                            questions having no reference to legislation, and thereby filling the
                            journal of the House with a large amount of useless matter, involving a
                            heavy expense to the State for printing.
                        For these and other reasons, he made the point of order that no two
                            members have a right, under the Constitution, to demand the yeas and
                            nays on the mere request of a member to be excused from voting on a
                            question of adjournment.
                        The SPEAKER. When this matter was brought up on Saturday, the Chair had
                            expressed some doubt in giving his opinion. And it was with great
                            respect and deference for the different opinion held by the President of
                            the Senate, that he was compelled to make the ruling to which he must
                            still adhere; It21was founded also upon the same clause of the
                            Constitution referred to by the gentleman from St. Joseph. If, as the
                            gentleman thinks, this is not a legislative question, then, certainly,
                            there would be no difficulty about it.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. The matter of the section was not the subject of
                            legislation.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair had reflected on it. It was not to be supposed,
                            that the framers of the Constitution intended to device a method of
                            legislation which could not be restrained. The Chair was simply
                            administering the rules as they are. In accordance with these permanent
                            rules under the Constitution, there was a clear right for two members to
                            demand the yeas and nays on any motion. The Chair had found great
                            difficulty with regard to this construction, and had been compelled to
                            revolve in his own mind what is the subject of this section. It was
                            evident, that a motion to adjourn was a proper legislative motion. It
                            would then follow, that the yeas and nays may be called. And as the
                            subordinate question of excuse from voting is a question of personal
                            privilege, there is a still stronger reason why the member should have a
                            record made of his vote. The Chair had considered the difficulty, and
                            the obstruction of the public business involved in it. Our own rule was,
                            that the motion to be excused shall be made before the question of
                            adjournment is put: and thus gives the motion for excuse priority of the
                            motion to adjourn. The Chair could only adhere to the former decision,
                            that any member may have the right to yeas and nays on a motion to be
                            excused from voting on a question of adjournment.
                        
                        The House then refused to excuse Mr. Coffroth from voting-yeas 32, nays
                            49.
                        
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted his motion, and, through the same routine, was
                            excused by the House-yeas 46, nays 11.
                        
                        Mr. MILROY and Mr. SPENCER each submitted his motion for excuse,
                            ineffectually-yeas 13, nays 47.
                        And then, on motion by Mr. HOWARD, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock
                            P. M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and stated the pending
                            question to be on the adoption of Mr. Branham's resolution to take up
                            the House bills 176,153 and 140,upon which the previous question had
                            been seconded and the main question ordered.
                         Mr. DUNHAM rose to a privilege question and moved that when this House
                            adjourns today it shall be till Wednesday, 12 o'clock M. demanding the
                            yeas and nays thereon, and there was a second.
                        Mr. BROWN thereupon submitted his motion in writing, to be excused from
                            voting.
                        Mr. DUNHAM objected, and Messrs. SPENCER and THACHER demanded the years
                            and nays.
                        
                        The yeas and nays were ordered, and being taken, resulted-yeas 12, nays
                            56.
                        So the House refused to excuse Mr. Brown.
                        Mr. BOYD inquired if a proposition to adjourn sine die
                            would be entertained at this time. He could see no good result to flow
                            from these proceedings.
                        
                        The SPEAKER. There can be no adjournment longer than three days without
                            the concurrent vote of both Houses.
                         Mr. BOYD. His question contemplated that.
                        The SPEAKER. The chair, then, is of opinion that no such motion could be
                            in order at this time.
                        Mr. BIRD, Mr. LEMON and Mr. BUSKIRK severally made ineffectual motions to
                            be excused from voting on the pending question each with its attendant
                            dilatory objections and yeas and nays.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to reconsider the vote just taken.
                        The SPEAKER. The motion is out of order. Whereupon--
                        Mr. BROWN and others appealed from the decision in these words:
                        "The undersigned respectfully appeal from the decision of the Chair to
                            the judgment of the House, in the case wherein the Chair decides that it
                            is not competent to reconsider the vote by which the gentleman from
                            Monroe was not excused from voting on the pending question before the
                            House."
                        Mr. DUNHAM then moved that the House do now adjourn.
                        Whereupon, Mr. SPENCER, Mr. DUNHAM, Mr. MILROY, and Mr. BECKEIT, made
                            each a similar dilatory motion, resulting, by yeas and nays, as
                            heretofore, in the refusal of excuse.
                        Mr. COFFROTH asked for unanimous consent to submit the following:
                        The undersigned ask for unanimous consent, that the present question
                            maybe laid aside for a motion to suspend the order of business, and take
                            up the bills numbered 140,153 and 176, signed by Messrs. Coffroth,
                            Griffith, Meredith and Bird.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) decided that the application
                            could not be received pending a motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. DUNHAM, upon being appealed to for that purpose, was willing to
                            withdraw the motion to adjourn.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER decided that it could not be withdrawn without
                            unanimous consent [''Object'];
                        Mr. SHOAFF of Jay, Mr. GLAZEBROOK, and Mr. HUNT, each submitted a motion
                            to be excused from voting, resulting ineffectually.
                        
                        The yeas and nays were demanded, ordered and taken on Mr. Dunham's motion
                            that the House do now adjourn, and it was decided in the negative--yeas
                            18, nays 55.
                        Mr. LASSELLE rose to a privilege question. Replying to the statement of
                            the gentleman from Wabash, last Saturday, to the effect that the
                            minority in this House had in caucus resolved last Thursday that they
                            would not vote to take up any bill out of its regular order, he denied
                            that the caucus adopted such a resolution.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER held that it was not a privilege question.
                        Mr. PETTIT rose, but objections being made, he did not respond.
                        Mr. MEREDITH asked unanimous consent to submit the following:
                        We ask the unanimous consent of the House to move that the order of
                            business be suspended, and that the House immediately proceed to the
                            consideration of the House bills numbered 140, 153, and 170. Signed by
                            M. Meredith, Mr. Griffith, Mr. Chambers, and several Democratic
                            members.
                        Mr. PETTIT. I myself object. That is just the matter now before the
                            House.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER ruled the matter out of order.
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the House do now adjourn.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the last question decided.
                        Mr. SPENCER then moved that the House adjourn till tomorrow (Tuesday) 12
                            M.
                        Mr. SPENCER, Mr. BECKETT, Mr. THACHER, Mr. LEMON, Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay,
                            submitted ineffectual motions to be excused from voting, which were
                            decided by yeas and nays.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to lay the motions for excuse and adjournment on the
                            table.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER decided that a question of personal privilege can
                            not be laid on the table.
                        Mr. DUNHAM submitted a motion to be excused from voting on the pending
                            question.
                        Mr. BRANHAM rose to a question of order, and submitted a paper, which was
                            read by the Clerk to the following effect:
                        Inasmuch as it is not the design of the minority of this House to defeat
                            the bills embraced in the pending resolution; and because the main
                            question has been ordered on the resolution, it is expedient that all
                            debates, amendments and motions for adjournment be postponed till the
                            main question shall be decided; and that the House now proceed to vote
                            on the main question.
                        Mr. BROWN. What was the point of order submitted?
                        The SPEAKER, (Mr. Henricks in the chair.) The Chair understood it to be,
                            that, since the House has ordered the vote to be now taken on the main
                            question, all these motions for adjournment and excuse are out of order.
                            By reference to the journal of Saturday, it was found that the main
                            question had been ordered by yeas and nays. By reference to Cushing's.
                            Manual, (from which he read,) the Chair was satisfied, that when the
                            main question has been ordered by the House "to be now put," it should
                            be put immediately, without any intervening motion.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. And the motion to adjourn is not in order?
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. One motion to adjourn is in order-but-
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Would it not be in order to move to adjourn to a time
                            certain?
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. Perhaps the Chair had better not decide too much
                            at once.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. With due respect to the Chair, he submitted that this is the
                            very same point of order presented by the gentleman from St. Joseph [Mr.
                            Henricks,] this morning and the then presiding officer overruled the
                            point.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point presented this morning, to which the
                            gentleman refers, was that no gentleman has the right to call the yeas
                            and nays on a motion to be excused from voting on adjournment.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK still insisted that the same point of order was overruled by
                            the Speaker on Saturday.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair was not aware that any such decision had
                            been made. Would the House hear the gentleman from Monroe.
                            ["Object."]
                        
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted an appeal from the decision of the chair, and also
                            from the derision overruling the appeal of the gentleman from Jackson
                            [Mr. Brown.] And thereupon he demanded the yeas and nays, and there was
                            a second. 
                        Mr. BROWN moved that the House do now adjourn. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved to be excused from voting.
                         The PRESIDING OFFICER could not entertain these motions, except the
                            appeal from the decision of the chair.
                        And the yeas and nays bring demanded, ordered and token, resulted--yeas
                            48, nays 16.
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Atkinson, Banta, Bonner, Boyd Branham, Burnes,
                                        Church, Cook, Cox, Crook, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke, Goodman,
                                        Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren, Groves,
                                        Henricks, Hershey, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover, Johnson, Kilgore
                                        Lane, Lockhart, Major, Meredith, Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb,
                                        Olleman, Rhoads, Rice, Riford, Sabin, Stewart, Stivers,
                                        Stringer, Upson, Welsh, Whiteside, Willis, Woodruff, Woods,
                                        Wright-46.
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Abbett, Brown, Burwell, Buskirk, Chambers,
                                        Coffroth, Glazebrook, Hargrove, Harrison, Hunt, Lasselle,
                                        Miller, of Clinton, O'Brien, Patterson, Perigo. 16.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the decision of the Chair stands as the judgment of the House.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved that the house do now adjourn demanding the yeas and
                            nays thereon, and there was a second by 10 members.
                        The House refused to adjourn yeas 22, nays 50.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker, I think it is evident that presence of the
                            minority members of the House will not be needed on this floor before
                            morning. I therefore respectfully ask leave of absence for all
                            Democratic members till tomorrow morning. [Turning and advancing toward
                            the door] We will take leave anyhow. I bid you an affectionate
                            farewell.
                        The SPEAKER [Mr. Henricks in the Chair.] directed the yeas and nays to be
                            called on the adoption of Mr. Branham's resolution, the same resulting
                            yeas 49, nays 12 (the Clerk reporting ten members present and not
                            voting) as follows:
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    YEAS--Messrs. Atkinson, Banta, Bonner, Boyd, Branham, Burnes,
                                        Chambers. Church, Cook, Cox Crook, Emerson, Ferris, Foulke,
                                        Goodman, Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren, Groves
                                        Hamrick, Henricks, Hershey, Higgins, Hogate, Hoover,
                                        Johnson, Kilgore, Lane, Lockhart, Major, Meredith,
                                        Montgomery, McVey, Newcomb, Olleman, Rhoads, Rice, Riford
                                        Sabin, Stewart, Stivers, Stringer, Upson, Welch, Whiteside,
                                        Willis, Woodruff, Woods, Wright, and Mr. Speaker--49.
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Burwell, Buskirk. Groan, Glazebrook, Lasselle,
                                        Miller, of Clinton, O'Brien, Osborn, Patterson, Perigo,
                                        Shoaff, of Jay, and White.--14.
                                
                            
                        
                        So Mr. Branham's resolution was adopted.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK inquired who was present within the bar and not voting?
                        Mr. KILGORE. It was not the privilege of the gentleman to make that
                            inquiry.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK appealed from the decision of the Chair in words to this
                            effect: "The resolution offered by the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr.
                            Branham,] having received forty-nine votes, while but twelve votes were
                            cast against said resolution, and the Chair having decided that the
                            resolution is passed without having received a two-thirds vote. There
                            not being time now to consider this question of appeal, he moved that
                            the House adjourn.
                        On motion by Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, the motion was modified so as to
                            make an order for a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK gave notice that there would be a caucus of Democratic
                            members in the Supreme Court Room at the same hour.
                        And then the House took a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock.
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                        The Speaker resumed the Chair at 7 1/2 o'clock.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, moved ineffectually for a call of the House. Mr.
                            WRIGHT desired to call up his motion to amend the 63d section of the
                            Rules of the House of Representatives.
                        The SPEAKER was doubtful about the presence of a quorum.
                        So, by unanimous consent, the roll was called by the clerk--determining
                            53 members present and answering to their names.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to excuse Mr. Welch.
                        The SPEAKER. The House cannot excuse without a quorum. But two motions
                            are in order--a call of the House and a motion to adjourn.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN moved that the Door-keeper be dispatched to the room below,
                            where gentlemen are understood to be holding a caucus, and respectfully
                            invite a sufficient number of them to come up and make a quorum.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB thought it best to adjourn.
                        Mr. BROWN did not think the sending of the Door-keeper down would do any
                            good. Gentlemen have something there that they want to talk about.
                        The SPEAKER. It has been the uniform practice, upon finding that there is
                            not a quorum in the House, to send for the absentees.
                        And then, at 8 o'clock P. M , the House adjourned till to-morrow morning
                            at 9 o'clock.
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                        TUESDAY, February 28, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 2 o'clock P. M.
                    The Secretary's minutes of yesterday were being read, when-
                    On motion of Mr. ALLISON, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    
                        PER DIEM TO THE STATE PRISON COMMITTEE.
                        On motion by Mr. DUNNING, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That each member of the
                                            Committee on State Prison be allow $3
                                        for every twenty-five miles traveled in visiting the
                                        Southern and Northern Prisons of this State, and that the
                                        Auditor draw his warrant on the Treasurer of State for said
                                        several amounts upon the certificate of the President of the
                                        Senate that said services were rendered.
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                         SESSION HOURS.
                        On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn it
                                        adjourn till to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock. 
                                
                            
                        
                    
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        Mr. TERRY presented two petitions praying for a majority liquor license
                            law, which was referred to the Committee on
                                Temperance without reading.
                        
                         Mr. TERRY also presented a petition from the citizens of Fulton county,
                            praying for a legislative enactment that may relieve the estate of H. W.
                            Mano, deceased, late Treasurer of Fulton county, from paying the sum of
                            $2,878 92., money belonging to the State, stolen from the county safe
                            when the said Mann was treasurer of said county. It was referred to the
                                Committee on Claims.He subsequently presented a
                            remonstrance from the same source, which took the same course. 
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        The Committee on Claims reported favorably on the
                            following accounts:
                        W. R Holloway & Co., for Daily Journals, $728 25; J. H. Jordan, for
                            Daily Gazette; $145 75; E. J. Metzger, for Weekly Freie Presse; $34 65;
                            C. Kindler, for sundries, $5; Bowen, Stewart & Co., for stationery,

                            stationery, $159 60, and $249 80, and $167 10, and $232 25.
                        The Committee on Corporations recommended the passage
                            of the bill, [S. 187, as a similar bill is before the Senate,] amending
                            the charter of the city of Madison.
                        Which reports were concurred in.
                    
                    
                        BUSINESS OF AN EXTRA SESSION.
                        Mr. NILES submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT: The Judiciary
                                Committee report to the Senate that they have carefully
                            considered Senate bill No 190,
                            providing for the completion of unfinished business of a session of the
                            General Assembly, in certain cases, and recommend that it be amended in
                            a few particulars, by adopting the words of the constitution and so as
                            to make it more general in its application, as shown by a memorandum
                            hereto attached; and the committee recommend that the bill, so amended,
                            be passed.
                        The committee are not able to see any constitutional objection to the
                            bill, and are of opinion that in all cases where a special session of
                            the General Assembly may be necessary, its provisions will work a great
                            saving of time, labor and expense. A special session of the General
                            Assembly is as completely a continuation of the same legislative body
                            previously convened, as if, instead of the session having terminated by
                            limitation of the constitution, or by adjournment sine
                                die, it had only adjourned over a holiday. It may sometime
                            occur that, at the close of a session, much important business will have
                            been prepared, reported on by committees, and only awaiting a final
                            vote. Measures may have passed one House, and have been on their passage
                            through the other. It is obvious that for the General Assembly, under
                            such circumstances, to proceed as if there had been no adjournment,
                            would greatly facilitate the business of legislation. The committee are
                            of opinion that the bill under consideration will effect that desirable
                            end.
                        The report was concurred in.

                                    Mr. ALLISON submitted the following: 
                                    MR. PRESIDENT: The Committee on
                                            the State Prison North, in discharge of their
                                        duty, have visited said prison and made due examination of
                                        its management, condition, necessities and accounts.
                                    Your committee desire to bear testimony to the management and
                                        control thereof, and have no hesitation in saying that the
                                        prasent Warden, Thomas Wood, Esq., evinces those qualities
                                        which are necessary to a proper and efficient control of
                                        those whom temptation and crime have placed outside of the
                                        pale of good society; and amidst the degrading circumstances
                                        of prison life. Energy, order, firmness and watchfulness
                                        upon his part, and those assisting him, demand from us this
                                        testimony in his behalf. In view of the fact that it is
                                        necessary for proper government of an institution of this
                                        kind, that the Warden become conversant with the temper,
                                        habits and disposition of those committed to his keeping,
                                        your committee depreciate the idea of frequent changes being
                                        made in the person of Warden, or that his fitness for said
                                        position be ever based upon political character.
                                    We find from the last report of the Director of said
                                        Institution, sustained by the report to the House in 1863,
                                        and confirmed by our own examination of the books and
                                        accounts of the prison, that the indebtedness of the prison
                                        to March 10th, 1863, was of principal $64,105 91, for which
                                        scrip has been issued under the signature of the Warden and
                                        Clerk, and countersigned by the Board of Control.
                                    Your committee find that the indebtedness of the prison from
                                        the 10th of March, 1863, until the 15th of December, 1864,
                                        for which scrip has not been issued, amounts to $13,510 88,
                                        and they ask that provision to pay this be made in the
                                        General Appropriation bill. We further recommend that the
                                        Warden be allowed the sum of two thousand dollars per annum,
                                        the use of the residence upon the prison grounds, and the
                                        necessary pasturage and garden land, but no other
                                        perquisites. We feel free in saying that the present salary
                                        allowed to the Warden is inadequate.
                                    We further recommed that such legislation be adopted as is
                                        necessary to abolish the office of Deputy Warden. He is a
                                        useless officer, except to draw a salary and live off the
                                        State. His place can be much better supplied by the guard.
                                        Your Committee would further state that it has been the
                                        constant practice of the Warden and Deputy Warden to have
                                        employed about their private business, convicts whose labor
                                        and time belongs to the State, without charging themselves
                                        for the same. We ask that this practice be prohibited by the
                                        Legislature. There is no justice in the Warden or his deputy
                                        using the labor of the State without compensation to the
                                        State, than there is in appropriating the money or ether
                                        property belonging to the State to their use without
                                        recounting for the same. Your Committee further report, from
                                        a hasty examination of the books and accounts in the
                                        Warden's office, they appear in the main to be correct; but
                                        as the time allotted to us to make the examination was so
                                        short we could not make an investigation which was
                                        satisfactory to ourselves or to the interest of the State.
                                        It would require the careful attention of a competent book
                                        keeper, with ample time to make a satisfactory report as to
                                        the condition of the books. In consequence of not having
                                        time to fully investigate the books and accounts, we do not
                                        feel warranted in saying there are any serious errors
                                        contained in the same. We do, however, call the attention of
                                        the Senate to the following discrepancy: The Warden charges
                                        himself with amount received from all sources in 1863,
                                        $20,689 55. when the actual amount received, as shown by the
                                        report of the Warden, amounts to the sum of $20,995 42,
                                        making a difference in favor of the state and against the
                                        Warden of $305 87.
                                    Your committee have examined with care the present condition
                                        of the prison buildings, and regret to say that from two to
                                        four feet of the main wall on the east side, enclosing the
                                        prison grounds, will have to be taken down, owing to the
                                        improper material used, and the manner the same was erected.
                                        They believe the amount asked for the completion of parts of
                                        the Northern Prison by the Board of Control, as stated in
                                        their report to be correct, but we regret to say that under
                                        existing circumstances we cannot recommend an appropriation
                                        by this Legislature for said purpose.
                                    The State has ample prison room in the Southern Prison for
                                        all the prisoners now confined in both prisons, and we do
                                        not feel that the people of the State ought to be burthened
                                        with additional taxation at this time to complete the
                                        Northern Prison however desirable it may be at some future
                                        time. It may cost the State a small amount in addition for
                                        grounds in the present unfinished condition of the prison,
                                        yet it is better to pay this additional amount than at this
                                        time to pay the heavier burthen upon the people by taxing
                                        them to raise $160,000 to complete the work asked for, as
                                        all kinds of labor and materials are double in price now to
                                        what they will be two years hence.
                                    
                                     Your Committee made a careful examination into the manner
                                        the prisoners had been kept and treated for the past two
                                        years. We take pleasure in bearing testimony to the
                                        faithfulness of the Warden. The prisoners uniformly say
                                        their treatment is good as, under the circumstances, they
                                        could ask. They have plenty of plain food well prepared.
                                    We found the prison in a clean, healthy condition. The
                                        committee would further report that all the shops' tools and
                                        machinery belonging to the prison, seems to be kept in good
                                        order and repair, and the work made by the prisoners of
                                        excellent quality. It is claimed by Mr. Silver in
                                        consequence of the delay of the State in failing to pay him,
                                        that he is entitled to damages for such delay. The committee
                                        find on examination that he contracted with a full knowledge
                                        that he was not to receive his pay until the Legislature
                                        made an appropriation for the same, and put in his bill
                                        accordingly, by reason of which they say he is not entitled
                                        to damages. Your committee also recommend that an
                                        appropriation of $30,000 for the support of the prison for
                                        the ensuing two years.
                                    Your Committee would further state that the prisons North and
                                        South, are each, as at present conducted, an expense to the
                                        State, costing from $15,000 to $20,000 per annum each, over
                                        and above all receipts, and as the committee are informed,
                                        and believe that said prisons can each be leaded to
                                        responsible parties, and will pay all expenses of the same
                                        and pay the State $10,000 per annum for the use of the
                                        prisons and the convict labor of each prison, we therefore
                                        recommend the speedy passage of Senate bill No. 153, which
                                        bill provides for the government and leasing of said
                                        prisons.
                                    The committee would recommend that a joint committee of
                                        three, one from the Senate and two from the House of
                                        Representatives, be appointed with leave to set at any time
                                        during the adjournment of the Legislature, with authority to
                                        send for persons and papers, whose duty it shall be to make
                                        a full investigation into the accounts, contract and
                                        management of the prisons north and south, and report their
                                        proceedings when complete to the Governor, who shall lay the
                                        same before the sessions of the Legislature next ensuing
                                        after paid report.
                                    All of which is respectfully submitted.

                                    
                                        J. Y. ALLISON, Chairman.
                                    

                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. CORBIN dissented from certain portions of the report.
                        Mr. ALLISON pronounced the Northern and Southern Prisons an incubus upon
                            the State and a drain upon the Treasury.
                        Mr. VAWTER was opposed to all those kinds of legislative committees-such
                            as this report recommends;they never amount to anything.
                        The report was concurred in by yeas 22, nays 20, as follows:

                                        Hamilton, Cason, Cullen, Davis, Dykes, Gifford, Hyatt,
                                        Milligan, Niles, Noves, Oyler, Peden, Richmond, Thompson,

                                        Marshall, Mason, Moore, Newlin, Staggs, Vawter, and
                                        Williams--20.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
                        Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following:
                         MR. PRESIDENT: The Judiciary
                                Committee to which was referred resolution of the Senate
                            instructing them to inquire into and report at what time the State has
                            to put in operation the agricultural college, from and after the passage
                            of the act of Congress appropriating lands for the endowment of such a
                            college, have had the same under consideration, and have directed me to
                            make the following report:
                        The third subdivision of section five of the act of Congress provides
                            that any State which may take and claim the benefit of the provisions of
                            the act, shall provide, within, five years at least, not less than one
                            college as described, in the fourth section of the act, or the grant to
                            said State shall, cease, and said State shall be bound to pay the United
                            States the amount received for any lands previously sold, and that the
                            title of purchases under the State shall be valid.
                        The seventh subdivision of said section requires the State to accept the
                            donation within two years of the date of the approval of the act by the
                            President. By a subsequent act, approved April 14, 1864, this time is
                            extended for two years from the approval of that act.
                        It will be thus seen that the point of time from which the period of five
                            years is to be computed, is not expressly fixed by the act, but the two
                            years within which the grant must be accepted must be reckoned from the
                            date of the approval of the original act in the one case, and the second
                            act in the other.
                        It seems to the committee pretty clear, receiving the third subdivision
                            alone, that the reasonable inference would be, that the time within
                            which the condition must be complied with is five years from the date of
                            the approval of the first act of Congress by the President.
                        But when the other provisions of the act above recited are considered,
                            there would seem to be no reasonable ground to doubt that such is the
                            proper construction of the law. Congress would hardly fix the date of
                            the approval of the act as the time from which the period of two years
                            should be reckoned, without intending, in the absence of any declaration
                            to the contrary, that the period of five years mentioned in the same
                            section of the act should also be computed from the same data.
                    
                    
                        EMPLOYEES OF THE SENATE.
                        On motion by Mr. OYLER, it was--
                        
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That no attachee of the Senate,
                                        or the Clerk, or attachee of any committee of the Senate, be
                                        allowed to draw for, or have certified to them any per diem,
                                        or other allowance so that their pay or reward shall in any
                                        way or manner be duplicated, but that a certificate or pay
                                        for service, as such Clerk or attachee for one committee,
                                        shall be in full for all services by such person for the
                                        same time.
                                
                            
                        
                        The State Prison Committee also made a report
                            recommending the passage of bill S.153, (seepage 193 of these
                            Reports)
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN of Wells, the report and bill were laid on the
                            table.
                    
                    
                        INDIANA FEMALE COLLEGE.
                        On motion of Mr. THOMPSON, his bill 181 (see page 294 of the Brevier Reports) was read by title
                            only, and referred to the Committee on
                            Corporations.

                        On motion of Mr. NILES, the bill H. R.
                                7 (seepage 41) was read the second and third time under a
                            dispensation of the constitutional provision, and finally passed by yeas
                            47, nays 0.

                    
                    
                        COUNTY AND OTHER BONDS.
                        


                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the Senate proceeded to consider the House
                            amendments to the bill S. 3--see
                            page 273 of these Reports.

                        Mr. BRADLEY. After voting for the amendment of the Senator from Howard
                            [Mr. Richmond,] I took occasion to make inquiry of distinguished lawyers
                            of our State, both Republican and Democratic, and I am assured by them
                            that a law of that character would be unconstitutional, and believing;
                            that it is our duty to make our legislation conform to the requirements
                            of the Constitution of our State, I therefore move to reconsider the
                            vote of the Senate adopting the amendment of the Senator from Howard,
                            exempting certain property ; from the payment of the tax contemplated in
                                 the bill legalizing the
                            issuing of county bonds.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS asked that the vote be reconsidered and that the Senate pass
                            the bill as it came from the House, with one simple amendment, and let
                            it become a law as soon as possible. The amendment destroys the
                            efficiency of the bill if it is allowed to remain.
                        Mr. OYLER undertook to say that so far as his information was concerned,
                            the soldiers do not ask us to tax them (as was proposed in this bill,)
                            to provide ways and means to keep others out of the army. This amendment
                            does not propose to exempt a solitary man from taxation, but provides
                            that the tax collector shall receipt to the have been or are now in the
                            field for service and labor performed to the amount of their tax as
                            assessed in this bill. If this amendment be stricken out the bill will
                            be lost.
                        Mr. ALLISON hoped the Senate would adhere to the amendment, it is so
                            manifestly right and just. He was satisfied there was no valid
                            constitutional objection to the amendment.
                        Mr. CULLEN insisted that this bill ought to pass, and pass with this
                            amendment incorporated in it. He was sure the amendment was
                            constitutional, and hoped the Senate would stand firm.
                        Mr. COBB argued against the constitutionality of the bill, citing
                            numerous authorities and appealing to the Constitution itself to sustain
                            his argument. He desired to guard this bill so that no unconstitutional
                            amendment should be incorporated in it.
                        Mr. CASON moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                        The motion was agreed to by yeas 26, nays 18 as follows:

                                        Marshall, Mason, Moore, Newlin, Staggs, Vawter, and
                                        Williams--18.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. TERRY moved to amend the first section by adding the following:

                        Provided, That volunteers and substitutes procured or
                            furnished by such bonds, orders or appropriations shall have been
                            equitably credited apportioned pro-rata to the several tow ships
                            composing the county where such appropriations have been made.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 24,
                            nays 18--as follows:

                                Whole were then concurred in.
                    
                    
                        REVENUE FOR 1865 AND 1866.

                                160, [see pages 217 and 263 of these Reports] was read the
                            third time and finally passed by yeas 43, nays 0.

                        Mr. VAWTER moved that the Senate proceed to the orders of the day.
                        Mr. BEESON proposed to amend the motion by an older that the Senate
                            proceed to consider the bill S. 160 (see page 215.)
                        
                        On motion of Mr. VAWTER, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 24,
                            nays 22.


                        Mr. RICHMOND proposed an amendment substituting the bill S. 126 (p. 138 )

                        Mr. VAWTER demanded the previous question. There was a second of
                            twenty-six Senators.
                         The main question was ordered, and being put--
                        The Senate agreed to the motion for the orders of the day.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to take up the bill, H. R. 59, (see page 262)
                            and upon that motion demanded the previous question.

                            and--
                        Mr. CULLEN submitted the following:
                        Mr. PRESIDENT: The Committee on Canals and
                                Internal Improvements to which was referred House bill No.
                            59, together with petitions and remonstrances, beg leave to report that
                            said bill was in our hands less than twenty-four hours, and said
                            petitions and remonstrances less than four hours, (the Senate being in
                            session during that time), they had no time to consider the same until a
                            resolution was passed by the Senate, taking the same out of the hands of
                            the Committee. And now, in pursuance of the said Senate resolution, the
                            Committee return said bill, petitions and remonstrances to the Senate
                            without any recommendation in regard thereto.
                        On motion of Mr. DUNNING the bill was read the second time.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the further consideration thereof was postponed
                            till 2 o'clock to-morrow.
                    
                    
                        UNITED STATES DIRECT TAX--PRESIDENT'S ADVANCE.
                        On motion by Mr. CASON, House bills 140 and 153 [see pages 169 and 179 of these Reports,] were
                            read the first time and then by title, and referred to appropriate
                            committees. 
                    
                    
                        NEW PROPOSITIONS.
                        
                        The Committee on Organization of Courts introduced a

                            office of judge of the circuit, common pleas or probate courts shall

                            that there shall be a vacancy in the office, and declaring an emergency;
                            which was read the first time only and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.
                        By Mr. PEDEN, [S. 193,] to amend
                            sections 4 and 5 of the act incorporating Knightstown, Henry county,

                        Read the second time by title only, and referred to the
                                Committee on Corporations.

                        SHERIFF'S FEES.
                        On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the bill S.
                                184 (introduced yesterday,) was read the second time and
                            ordered engrossed for the third read--
                        And then the Senate adjourned.
                    
                


                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         TUESDAY, February 28, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed the roll-call to
                        determine a quorum.
                    Mr. MILLER of Clinton stated that Mr. Collins was absent on account of
                        sickness--confined to his room.
                    Mr. MILROY stated that Mr. Humphreys was absent on account of sickness--from
                        day to day.
                    The SPEAKER. The clerk reports no quorum. After some time, the Chair
                        suggested a call of the House.
                    The order was taken without a division, and the call proceeded-the clerk
                        still reporting no quorum present.
                    The SPEAKER directed the proper officers of the House to close the doors.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB moved that the absentees be sent for.
                    Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays thereon.
                    The Speaker then directed the Clerk to read the 14th rule:
                    "14. Upon the call of the House, the names cf the members shall be called
                        over by the Clerk, and the absentees noted; after which the names of the
                        absentees shall again be called over, the doors shall then be shut, and
                        those for whom no excuse, or insufficient excuses are made, may be taken
                        into custody, as they appear, or may be sent for and taken into custody,
                        wherever to be found, by the Sergeant-at-Arms, or the officer discharging
                        the duties of such sergeant, or by special messengers to be appointed for
                        that purpose."
                    The SPEAKER, The gentleman from Jackson will perceive that no motion is
                        necessary to dispatch the proper officers for absentees.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that some members of the minority-a part of them-were
                        detained by sickness.
                    Mr. CHURCH suggested that Mr. Shuey was sick.
                    Mr. BRANHAM. He would be here, if necessary to make a quorum.
                    The Doorkeeperr reported Mr. Lasselle present and under arrest.
                    Mr. LASSELLE did not know that he was under arrest, till it was announced
                        from the Chair. He had been unwell, &c.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB moved that Mr. Lasselle be discharged from arrest, without fine
                        or censure.
                    Mr. BROWN rose to a question of order.
                    The gentleman from Cass was not under arrest.
                    The SPEAKER. The question coming on since the doors had been shut, made it a
                        technical arrest.
                     Mr. LASSELLE was discharged from arrest.
                    The Door-keeper reported Mr. Shuey present.
                    On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, he was discharged from custody without fine or
                        costs.
                    Mr. PATTERSON appeared and was likewise excused.
                    Mr. SPEAKER announced a quorum present.
                    On motion by Mr. HENRICKS, all farther proceedings under the call of the
                        House were disensed with.
                    The SPEAKER again directed the reading of the journal of yesterday.
                    Mr BRANHAM moved to dispense with the reading of the journal.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK desired the reading of some of the last pages of the record,
                        which was taken by consent, and they were read by the Clerk.
                    The journal was read from the presentation of Mr. Branham's point of order,
                        in the afternoon session.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK moved to strike out so much of the journal as alleges that ten
                        members were present and refusing to vote on the adoption of that order.
                    Mr. BROWN. So far as the journal reports that he was present and not voting,
                        he said he was not in the House at the time the vote was taken. He was in
                        the stationery room.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. This involved the question, What is the bar of the House? A
                        portion of the members placed as present and not voting, he supposed, were
                        in the lobby at the time. He showed from the practice of the House that the
                        railing inclosing the desks and benches is the bar, and insisted that the
                        journal ought not to show that members in the lobby were within the bar,
                        present and not voting. We have no rule requiring the Clerk to note the fact
                        that member is present and refusing to vote. Some years ago we had such a
                        rule, but it had been dropped. It gave too much power to a ministerial
                        officer. He made the point, that those ten gentlemen were not within, the
                        bar of the House, and, therefore, cannot be recorded as present and refusing
                        to vote. He did not want to see a precedent of this kind set, but if it was
                        to be, he wanted to understand the ruling.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB. It would be well enough to look at this question before putting
                        it to the vote. It seemed to him that gentlemen were falling into error. The
                        question was whether it is competent for a member in the House, under the
                        eye of the Speaker, and within the call of the clerk, to break a quorum by
                        simply refusing, to answer to his name, or by stepping into the lobby. He
                        read the 28th rule, to show that it had no reference to a question of this
                        sort. Should gentlemen sitting on the floor and declining to answer by vote
                        when called, and declining to ask leave to vote-should they not be counted
                        as present? And if counted, was it not competent to enter the fact upon the
                        journal, so as to show that a quorum was in at-tenndance? This rule was
                        simply limiting the personal privilege to vote. Suppose a gentleman comes in
                        from the street before the vote is announced, was he not recorded as present
                        and voting? It would be putting a falsehood on the journal to say that these
                        members were not present.
                    
                     The gentleman had said that there was no rule of finding what is the bar of
                        the House. But the Constitution presumes that every member would be present
                        and perform his duty; and the Constitution prescribes that two-thirds, shall
                        be necessary to constitute a quorum. In the absence, then, of any rule to
                        find the bar of the House, he insisted that it was competent for the Clerk
                        to announce any gentleman present who may be anywhere in the Hall. There was
                        something monstrous in the idea that any member may be permitted to prevent
                        a quorum by stepping six inches from an imaginary line. He affirmed again,
                        that recording a gentleman as not present, because outside of the railing,
                        would be putting upon the journal what is not true. It was a mere quibble to
                        say that a member is not present when he is in this room. This was the Hall
                        of the House. Hence, every man in the room ought to be counted for the
                        quorum. And this rule would take away no right. The record was true, and
                        ought not to be corrected.
                    Mr. BROWN. So far as he was concerned, he was not in the room when the vote
                        was taken. He may have been in for a moment before the result was announced.
                        The gentleman from Wabash (Judge Pettit) had just told him that he was in
                        the room about the time the vote was announced. He certainly did not
                        remember hearing any gentleman's name called. He was not in the room when
                        the vote was had, but was here when the appeal was taken from the judgment
                        of the Chair. He stated the facts in detail. Clearly he was not within the
                        bar under the construction of the gentleman from Marion.
                    Mr. HIGGINS distinctly remembered the presence of the gentleman from Jackson
                        during the call of the yeas and nays.
                    Mr. NEWCOMB also asked to correct Mr. Brown in all friendship. The vote was
                        progressing when he saw the gentleman in the Hall.
                    Mr. BROWN knew positively that he had made up his mind to be absent during
                        the vote. It was his impression that he carried out his determination. He
                        might have been caught in the close. He moved that the journal be amended by
                        striking out his name, as present and not voting.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. The question: what is the law of the House? ought to be settled.
                        With one exception, (in the sessions of 1863,) it had never been held that
                        these walls were the bar. He thought we had better get back to the old
                        fashioned way -better conform to established usages. We have, both parties,
                        done wrong-and it were better to quit and go to work. He withdrew his
                        motion, and submitted that those members were in the lobby, and that the
                        journal be made to state the fact accordingly.
                    Mr. GREGORY. To his certain knowledge gentlemen had been counted and recorded
                        as voting many times this session when they were round these stoves.
                    The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair,) stated the fact that the clerk had
                        read the vote of members present and not voting, by direction of the
                        Chair.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK. The rule was clear, requiring a member to be within the bar. But
                        this ruling for the journal gave too much power to the clerk.
                    Mr. GROVES read rule 27-every member shall vote, unless, &c. He insisted
                        on the record, so long as those members were in the House. If gentlemen want
                        to bolt, they should go a little further.
                    Mr. RIFORD could not vote for Mr. Buskirk's amendment because there were some
                        of them inside the bar at the time.
                    Mr. LASSELLE. How did the clerk know that they refused to vote? He cited the
                        case of Mr. Brown. This would raise questions of veracity. Were these
                        gentlemen called upon to vote? Certainly they were not in their places. It
                        was impossible to determine the fact of design to refuse to vote.
                    Mr. BRANHAM hoped the amendment of the journal would not be adopted. Part of
                        these members were within the bar. Mr. Milroy was one--
                    Mr. MILROY denied. He was at the stove when his name wes called.
                    Mr. BRANHAM. Before the result was announced the gentleman came round into
                        his place.
                    Mr. BROWN'S amendment to strike out his name was rejected, without a
                        division.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK restored his amendment to the form in which it was first
                        offered.
                    And the yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                        resulted--yeas 26, nays 54-as follows:
                    
                    
                        
                            
                                YEAS--Messrs. Abbett, Brown, Buskirk, Croan, Glazebrook, Gregg,
                                    Harrison, Hunt, Lasselle, Lee, Lemon, Lopp, Miller, of Clinton,

                    So the House refused to amend the journal.
                    The journal of yesterday was partly read, then authenticated and
                        approved.
                    
                        ORDER OF BUSINESS.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN now raised a point of order on the adoption of Mr. Branham's
                            resolution to take up House bills 176, 153 and 140, That resolution was
                            offered on Saturday, and it proposed to take up and make those certain
                            bills the special order for that day. But the House adjourned that day
                            without adopting the resolution, and it was not adopted till Monday. The
                            point he made was, that the time fixed in the resolution for the
                            consideration of those bills has passed, and therefore there is no time
                            now to act upon the bills which it proposed to take up.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB proposed that this point be passed by informally, and that
                            the House now take up the bill No.
                                176.
                         Mr. BROWN said this was a subject in the nature of an appeal; and it was
                            not competent to debate it, or make any mention in reference to it.
                        
                        The CHAIR. It was to decide a question not before the House. It could not
                            be entertained. So far as the appeal is concerned, the Chair could
                            hardly be expected to entertain an appeal from the action of the House.
                            A protest could be, but not an appeal. The Chair had not decided on the
                            validity and power of the resolution.
                        Mr. BROWN then submitted the point that the resolution was
                            inoperative.
                         The PRESIDING OFFICER admitted that there were doubts in his mind on the
                            subject.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to amend Mr. Newcomb's motion, by suspending the
                            regular order of business and taking up the General Appropriation bill,
                            No. 176.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB acquiesced--and upon conversation with the Chair and across
                            the House, it was understood that this bill [No. 176,] be taken up
                            without reference to points of order involved in the ruling the action
                            of the House upon the order submitted Saturday and yesterday by Mr.
                            Branham.
                    
                    
                        GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS--1865, 1866.
                        
                         On the motion to suspend the order of business and take up the bill No.
                            176, the yeas and nays having been demanded, ordered and taken thereon,
                            resulted- -yeas 79, nays 0.
                         So the General Appropriation bill [H.
                                R. No. 176] was taken up and read the second time by the
                            clerk.
                        Mr. HIGGINS proposed to amend the bill by inserting the sum of of $64,155
                            90, allowed for the Northern Prison accounts to March, 1863 for which
                            certificates have been given. This amount had been reported by the
                            Warden and Board of Controls and included in the bill from be
                                Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that these amendments, as offered, be referred to
                            the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        Mr. BRANHAM concurred. The committee wanted time to complete the bill and
                            report it back.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. If the bill be now referred, would it be competent for
                            gentlemen standing as chairmen of committees to offer amendments and
                            have them referred to the Committee on Ways and
                            Means?
                        The SPEAKER. The Chairman understands not.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. It will be in order to amend, when the bill comes back. If
                            we go to filling up the blanks now it will take too much time.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH desired that his bill appropriating $171,353 59 toward the
                            Northern Prison-which includes the amendment submitted by the gentleman
                            from Laporte, should also be referred to the Committee on Ways
                                and Means.
                        Mr. BRANHAM thought it best, that the amendments be referred without
                            premptory instructions.
                        Subsequently, by general consent, the bill was referred to the
                                Committee of Ways and Means, with the amendments,
                            without reading.
                        Mr. BOYD suggested, as a short way, to refer the prison claims bills at
                            the same time.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to include in the bill an allowance of $600 to Merrill
                            & Co. for Indiana Reports, which he explained, which was also
                            referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        On motion, of Mr. BOYD, (the rules being suspended for the purpose.) the
                            Northern Prison bill, No. 132, and the Samuel H. Patterson bill, No. 72,
                            were referred to the Committee on Ways and Means.
                        On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, his bill which embraces the amendment of the
                            gentleman from Laporte, &c., was also taken up and referred to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means.
                    
                    
                        THE PRESIDENT'S ADVANCE-$250 000.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BROWN, Mr. Branham's bill [H. R. 153,] ratifying the
                            action of the Governor in procuring an advance of $250,000 from the
                            President of the United States, for the preparation of troops for the
                            service of the United States, and for the defense of the State,
                            directing the Governor to pay the unexpended balance thereof into the
                            Treasury of the State, and to account for the amount thereof to the
                            President of the United States, as money advanced to the State-was taken
                            up and read the second time by the clerk.
                        
                        On the further motion of Mr. BROWN, (it being declared expedient to
                            suspend the constitutional restriction--yeas 71, nays 1.) the bill was
                            ordered to the third reading, read the third time, considered as
                            engrossed, and finally passed the House--yeas 67, nays. 11.
                    
                    
                        REPORTER TO THE SUPREME COURT.
                        

                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the Senate bill No. 101, with reference to the
                            Supreme Court Reporter, was taken up, read the first; time and passed to
                            the second reading.
                    
                    
                        UNITED STATES DIRECT TAX.
                        

                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. Branham's bill, [H. R. No. 140,] ratifying the
                            action of the Governor in settling and discharging the State's quota of
                            direct tax levied by the Congress of 1861, [$904,825 86] and authorizing
                            him to settle all unsettled claims of the State against the United

                            reading.
                        
                        Mr. NEWCOMB called attention to sundry clerical errors in the bill, and
                            they were severally corrected as he recited them. This was a bill simply
                            to ratify the act of the Governor in the settlement of the direct tax,
                            amounting to nearly a million of dollars. On his further motion, (it
                            being declared expedient for this purpose to suspend the Constitutional
                            restriction yeas 77, nays 0-) the bill was considered as engrossed, read
                            the third time, and passed the final reading in the House of
                            Representatives--yeas 73, nays 1.
                        Mr. McVEY, (by consent) from the Committee on Mileage,
                            reported on the mileage of Messrs. Lane and Hamrick.
                        Mr. RICE moved for unanimous consent to take another final vote on his
                            Equal Footing Railroad bill, No. 9, [see p. 45.]
                        Mr. CHAMBERS objected.
                    
                    
                        THE MORGAN AND OTHER REBEL RAIDS BILL.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the Senate Morgan Raid bill, No. 15, was taken up, and passed
                            to the second reading, and referred to a select committee of five.
                            Whereupon the Chair appointed Messrs. Buskirk, Church, Sullivan, of
                            Scott, Kilgore and Wright.
                        The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock 
                    
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION. 
                        The SPEAKER resumed the Chair at two o'clock, and stated the regular
                            order--the consideration of House bill No. 8.

                        
                            THE SUPREME AUTHORITY.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB, by unanimous consent, presented the memorial of sundry
                                citizens of Indiana, belonging to the Jewish faith, embracing the
                                preamble and resolutions of a public meeting of Israelites,
                                remonstrating against the proposed amendments to the Constitution
                                for a more formal religions acknowledgment of the supreme authority
                                in the affairs of nations. 
                        
                        
                            DOG LAW.
                            

                            The House then took up the Senate amendments to Mr. Shoaff of Allen's
                                dog bill [H. R. No. 8], and
                                they were severally concurred in; with the amendment to the title,
                                adding, "to discourage the keeping of useless and sheep-killing
                                dogs."
                            Mr. WRIGHT, (by unanimous consent,) submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        WHEREAS, The House Journal of the
                                            present session will be unusually large, thereby greatly
                                            increasing the time and labor that it will require to
                                            properly and correctly prepare an Index for the game:
                                            Therefore, be it
                                        Resolved, That Cyrus T. Nixon,
                                            Principal, and T. W. O. Braffett, Assistant Clerk of
                                            this House, be allowed each the sum of one hundred and
                                            twenty-five dollars, for preparing said Index, making
                                            put; the title of bills introduced, and for

                                            such other work connected therewith, and that the
                                                Committee of Ways and Means are
                                            hereby instructed to incorporate said amount in the
                                            Specific Appropriation bill for said work.
                                    
                                
                            
                            It was adopted.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, (by consent,) from the Committee on
                                    Education, introduced a bill [H. R. 199] for an act to
                                provide for the distribution of the school, sinking and trust funds
                                held by this State:
                            Which was passed to the second reading and referred to the
                                    Committee on Education. 
                        
                        
                            COMMON SCHOOLS.
                            

                            On motion by Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, the House resumed the unfinished
                                business of the special order, viz: the consideration of Mr. Rhoads'
                                common school bill, [H. R. No.
                                    178,] The pending question being on Mr. Coffroth's
                                amendment inserting the word "white" in the 10th section, so as to
                                read "for the education of the white children therin."
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said the Committee on
                                    Education and the friends of the bill had agreed that
                                these amendments shall be made, in order to gain friends and get the
                                best school law we can.
                            Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered, and
                                being taken, resulted--yeas 64, nays 20--as follows:
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        YEAS--Messrs. Abbett, Banta, Bird, Boyd, Burton, Burwell,
                                            Buskirk, Coffroth, Cook, Croan, Crook, Emerson, Ferris,

                                            Upson, Veach, Welch, White, Whiteside, Woodruff, Wright,
                                            and Mr. Speaker--64.
                                        NAYS--Messrs. Atkinson, Bonner, Burnes, Chambers, Church,
                                            Cox, Henricks, Higgins, Hogate Johnson, Kilgore,
                                            Lockhart, Reese, Rhoads, Riford, Sabin, Sim, Trusler,
                                            Willis and Woods--20.
                                    
                                
                            
                             So the amendment was adopted.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, the section 168--principles of Government
                                to be taught in the schools--was stricken out--yeas 47, nays 40.
                            Mr. RICE submitted the following:
                            Amend by striking out section 121 of said bill for an Assistant
                                Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                            The amendment was concurred in.
                            Mr. HIGGINS moved to farther amend the bill by striking out the
                                sections 34 to 43 inclusive--all that part in reference to School
                                Examiners and examinations. Mr. H. objected to this office of County
                                Examiner, at $4 a day. He was not opposed to a School Examiner, but
                                to the extraordinary powers conferred on him here. There was
                                machinery enough in those ten sections to run a steamboat. No
                                district could employ a teacher unless he were licensed; and the
                                Examiner could revoke the license at any moment, and the school must
                                stop.
                            Mr. RHOADS replied. The gentleman was mistaken. The bill gave but one
                                thing to the examiner not in the old law, and that is, when he
                                revokes a license, the school must stop. Under the old law the
                                examiner had more power than under this bill. He could revoke a
                                license issued by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. If these
                                sections were stricken out, we should have an examiner with nothing
                                to do-a sinecure-besides other difficulties. He reasoned for the
                                provision that the school should stop when the license is revoked.
                                Had not this examiner's feature of the system worked wen. Strike
                                down these sections, and we strike down the efficiency cf the school
                                system-strike down the standard of qualifications of teachers,
                                &c.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, inquired as to the amount of pay of all
                                these examiners.
                            Mr. RHOADS answered. Would any gentleman here appoint a man that
                                would work for less than $4 a day?
                            Mr. OLLEMAN proposed to amend the 43d section by striking out "four"
                                and inserting "three," &c.
                            The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) decided that the amendment
                                was not applicable now.
                            Mr. BROWN moved a division of the question, and gave reasons. He
                                submitted that, if the gentleman from Laporte had treated us fairly,
                                he would have moved to strike out section 33, which provides for the
                                appointment of these Examiners. To strike out the sections that the
                                gentleman proposes, would be to have an officer clothed with no
                                power to execute the functions of his office. In his judgment
                                incompetent teachers had worked more evil in our school system than
                                all other causes combined. He would have the sections passed upon
                                separately, because we might agree in retaining some of the powers
                                of the Examiners.
                             Mr. LANE referred to the fact that the examiner had the right to
                                revoke licenses and stop schools. Under the old law the directors
                                could do this, which gave occasion for the operations of prejudice,
                                leading to litigations, &c.  The House refused to strike out sections 33,34, and 35.
                             Mr. WRIGHT proposed to strike out the clause in section 36 which
                                provides that the revocation of the license shall stop the
                                school.
                             Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to amend the amendment by striking out all
                                after the word "school" in the second line. It was rejected, and
                                then Mr. Wright's amendment was rejected. The House refused to
                                strike out sections 36,37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43. 
                            Mr. REESE proposed to amend section 41, striking out the penalty of
                                $50 for failure to make the required reports at the proper time.
                            Mr. RHOADS. This was written to require promptitude of the examiner. 
                            Mr. COFFROTH. It was a penalty that it fall on the children of the
                                county.
                            Mr. RHOADS. Provision was made for an action against the
                                Examiner.
                            The amendment was adopted.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Clinton," proposed to amend the 32d section-strike out
                                "4" and insert "2 1/2."
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to insert "three."
                            Mr. MILLER accepted.
                            Mr OLLEMAN proposed to amend the amendment by inserting after the
                                word "revenue," a clause restricting the Examiner's annual
                                compensation to $300, exclusive of pay for examinations.
                            Mr. RHOADS explained the section, and the reason and the necessity
                                for it. It was provided that the County Commissioners shall
                                determine how many days the Examiner shall serve, and pay him $4 a
                                day. This rule would apply to all counties, large and small. In some
                                counties he might not even be required to labor a number of days
                                sufficient to pay him $100 a year-the annual pay of Examiner now. He
                                gave the law in other States relative to School Examiners and their
                                pay. The State of Indiana was possessed of an average of resources
                                and capital with other States, and more than an average of glory in
                                war. Should she prove herself the poorest paymaster of all?
                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, Mr. Olleman's amendment was laid on the
                                table.
                            Mr. MILLER of Clinton's amendment was adopted.
                            Mr. SPENCER proposed to strike out section 56 and insert: No sale
                                shall be allowed, unless a majority shall vote for such rule, and
                                the number constituting the majority shall exceed 15.
                             Mr. SPENCER proposed to amend the 75th section with regard to the
                                title to real estate offered in mortgage for loans.
                            Mr. HOWARD. The difficulty was in getting a title sufficient to
                                warrant the loan, without making out a thorough abstract of title.
                                This was a difficulty in Clinton county. He thought it best to
                                require the applicant only to furnish "a good and sufficient title
                                in fee simple."
                            Mr. SPENCER accepted.
                            The amendment was adopted.
                            Mr. HOGATE proposed to amend the last section (171) so that "this act
                                shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage."
                            Mr. COFFROTH suggested an amendment to the amendment-striking out and
                                inserting:
                            " And it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to cause a
                                sufficient number of copies of this act to, be printed and
                                circulated in the different counties of the State."
                            These amendments were adopted.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend in the 108th section so as to read:
                                "For clerks' certificate, 50 cents; Recorders' certificate, $1." 
                            Mr. HARRISON proposed to strike out section 11, and insert to this
                                effect:
                            "The common school fund shall be equally divided and distributed for
                                tuition among the several districts of the several townships by the
                                Trustees thereof, and each district shall be numbered.
                            Mr. RHOADS. There was no more equitable management than to let the
                                section remain as it stands.
                            Mr. WOODS hoped this amendment would prevail. In his region there was
                                unreasonable inequality. There was no inducement to economy under
                                this provision as it stands in the bill.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB said such a system of distribution as the amendment
                                proposes would destroy the common school system.
                            The amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. WOODS and others desired to submit amendments, but--
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, demanded the previous question, and there was
                                a second, and the main question was ordered.
                            The bill was then ordered to the third reading, considered as
                                engrossed, and read the third time.
                            The yeas and nays on the final passage of the bill resulted yeas 76,
                                nays 10--as follows:

                                            Woodruff, Woods, and Speaker --76.
                                        NAYS--Messrs. Bird, Goodman, Hargrove, Hunt, Lemon, Lopp,
                                            Richards, Sim, Sullivan, of Scott, and Wright--10.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. SIM, in explanation, said the section 168 of this bill had been
                                stricken out. He had voted to retain it. It provides that "the
                                teachers in the common schools of the State shall teach the
                                principles of the National and State Governments so far as the same
                                may be practicable, and shall inculcate in the minds of the people
                                the love of country." Mr. Speaker, the principle involved in this
                                section is that which induced me and thousands of my fellow-citizens
                                to go forth and do battle for our Government which we love so much.
                                And when gentlemen see proper to strike out of the bill a
                                requisition that the principles of this Government shall not be
                                taught in the common schools, I can not vote for the bill. We can
                                well afford to wait for a better school law till the people can
                                elect legislators that love their country better.
                            So the bill passed the House of Representatives.
                            
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, proposed to amend the title by inserting
                                these words: "And providing penalties therein prescribed."
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the title by inserting: "And
                                prescribing fees for certain officers therein named."
                            Mr. WHITESIDE proposed to amend the title further by adding: "And
                                providing for security on loaning the school fund."
                            And so amended the title was agreed to.
                            On motion by Mr. Speaker PETTIT, the House, without a division,
                                proceeded to the consideration of bills on the third reading.
                        
                        
                            COURTS OF CONCILIATION.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, (by consent,) his bill [H. R. 43] to
                                repeal the act establishing courts of conciliation, was taken up and
                                passed the final reading in the House of Representatives--yeas 80,
                                nays 4.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was ordered that when the House
                                adjourns, it shall be till 7 1/2 o'clock this P. M.
                            The House then took a recess till that hour.
                        
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                        The Speaker resumed the chair at 7 1/2 o'clock P. M., and the roll-call
                            was directed by consent and proceeded with till a quorum was
                            determined.

                        
                             PARTITION FENCES.
                            Mr. Woods's bill [H. R. 29,] to amend the 15th. section of the act
                                concerning enclosures, trespassing animals, &c., [see page 65]
                                coming up--
                            Mr. WOODS explained that this was a bill to define a partition
                                fence--it shall be sufficient to enclose and restrain sheep, unless
                                the parties thereto shall otherwise agree.
                            
                            The bill was ordered to the third reading, read the third time and
                                passed the House of Representatives-yeas-- , nays-- , No quorum
                                voting. 
                            On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, a call of the House was ordered and
                                proceeded--and the proper officers were dispatched for the
                                absentees.
                            After some time the DOORKEEPER, at intervals reported Messrs. Willis,
                                Chambers, Rice, Montgomery, Brown and Olleman, present and under his
                                arrest; and were severally discharged without forfeiture or
                                censure.
                            On the motion of Mr. SPENCER, further proceedings under the call of
                                the House were dispersed with; and then
                            
                            Mr. Wood's Partition Fence bill [H. R. 29] was passed the final
                                reading--yeas 67, nays 2.
                        
                        
                            EXEMPTION FROM EXECUTION.
                            Mr. Burnes' bill [H. R. 31] to amend section one of the exemption act
                                of February 17, 1862, coming up,--it was ordered to the third
                                reading, and read the third time. [It exempts $500 instead of
                                $300.]
                            Mr. LASSELLE suggested that it was deficient in the matter of an
                                enacting clause.
                            On motion of Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, it was laid on the
                                table--affirmative 49, negative 22. 
                        
                        
                            OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD.
                            On motion by Mr. BROWN, (by unanimous consent,) the Senate Railroad
                                bill, No. 30, [see page 44,] was taken up and read the second
                                time.
                        
                        
                            ANN VIZARD.
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the vote by which the House ordered the
                                consideration of engrossed bills of the House was reconsidered; and
                                then--
                            Mr. Bird's bill, [H. R. 71,] for the relief of Ann Vizard, was taken
                                up and read the second time.
                            Mr. PETTIT. What was the necessity for this law, if Ann Vizard is an
                                heir to the intestate deceased? The effect of the bill was to invest
                                in a person a right which, if she is a blood relation of the
                                original owner, she has already under the existing law. He
                                understood that this land belonged to the common school fund.
                            Mr. COFFROTH stated the facts set forth in in the bill. If it were
                                not for the feet of alienage, Ann Vizard would be the heir. There
                                had been no escheat yet to the State. Similar bills had been
                                frequently passed by the Legislature. Ann Vizard was a natural heir
                                to Curley, the deceased, the State relinquishing its right to the
                                land to the person that would to the heir, but far the fact of
                                alienage.
                            Mr. BOYD. Was not this application refused in 1859, and in 1861 ?
                            Mr. COFFROTH stated that the application had never been made
                                before.
                            Mr. PETTIT asked if the facts asserted in the bill have been proved
                                to the satisfaction of the committee by evidence.
                            Mr. BIRD, Not by evidence; but to the satisfaction of the court
                                otherwise.
                            After further debate--
                            Mr. PETTIT asked that the bill be postponed.
                            Mr. COFFROTH interposed the request that it rest in its place on the
                                calendar.
                            It was so ordered. 
                            On motion of Mr. HOWARD, Mr. McVey s bill [H. R. 125] for amendment
                                of sections one and two of the county seat act of March 2, 1855,
                                [petition of two-thirds, a donation of two lots of ground, and of
                                $50 to employ, an architect to furnish a plan for the county
                                building, with further modifications,] was read the second time.
                            On motion of Mr. BROWN it was referred to a select committee of five.
                                The SPEAKER, (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,) announced said committee,
                                viz: Brown, Kilgore, Wright, Howard and Whiteside. 
                            On motion by Mr. WOODS, his drainage bill, No. 126, [it amends
                                section five of the Surveys and Drains act of Jane 12, 1852,] was
                                taken up and read the second time and ordered to be engrossed.
                            On motion by Mr. FOULKE, his Turnpike bill, No. 149, to enable
                                turnpike boards to change their name, was taken up, read the second
                                time, and ordered to engrossment.
                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, his Doctor bill, No. 180, was taken up and
                                read the second time.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend, that that Board be composed of an
                                equal number of allopathic, botanic, eclectic, hydropathic, and
                                homoeopathic physicians.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. RHOADS, the bill was infinitely postponed.
                            On motion by Mr. KILGORE, his bill No.34 to amend the 18th section of
                                the act regulating descents and the apportionment of estates, of May
                                14, 1852, was taken up and read the second time, with the amendments
                                proposed by the Committee on the Organization of Courts of
                                    Justice.
                            Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe. The present law does not allow the second
                                wife to alienate the property of her husband.
                             The amendment allows that where the husband has no children, or the
                                descendants of children, by a former marriage, she may alienate the
                                lands.
                            Mr. PETTIT suggested difficulties, even with the modification
                                suggested by the committee and the gentleman from Tippecanoe. His
                                judgment was against the bill.
                            Mr. KILGORE thought this right ought to be secured to the woman to
                                the fullest extent.
                            Mr. PETTIT gave a case.
                            The amendment was rejected.
                            Mr. KILGORE admitted that the amendment was vital to the bill.
                            On motion by Mr. WHITESIDE, the bill was now passed over
                                informally.
                            On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, his bill No. 186 declaring the existing
                                laws sufficient to authorize the payment of the interest on the
                                public debt, was taken up, read the second time, and ordered to be
                                engrossed. 
                            On motion of Mr. WHITESIDE, the Senate joint resolution, No. 11,
                                requesting the Governor to appoint same suitable person to revise
                                the swamp land sale books in the office of the Auditor of State, was
                                taken up and passed to the second reading.
                            On motion of Mr. LOCKHART, Mr. Stringer's bill, [No. 124 ] regulating
                                sheriffs' fees, was taken up, and passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, made an ineffectual motion to take up the
                                Senate bill No. 168.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH moved an adjournment.

                                incorporated towns and cities, to pay any money out of their
                                Treasuries or to issue any bonds, orders or evidences of

                             SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of
                                    Indiana, That all bonds or orders heretofore issued, or
                                appropriations made, by and under the authority of the Boards of
                                Commissioners of the several counties of this State, and the
                                incorporated cities and towns thereof, for the purpose of procuring

                                ratified, affirmed, and legalized.
                            SEC. 2. That any levy and assessment for taxes made by any
                                incorporated city or town, or Board of County Commissioners of any
                                county of this State, to procure means to pay any appropriations by
                                them made, or bonds and orders issued for the purposes in the
                                foregoing section enumerated, be and the same are hereby legalized:
                                    Provided, that the Boards of Commissioners of
                                such counties and the municipal authorities of cities, and towns, as
                                may have issued bonds or orders, or made appropriations for the
                                purposes enumerated in the first section of this act, be and they
                                are hereby required to levy and collect a tax sufficient to pay at
                                least one-fourth of the amount of such bonds, orders and
                                appropriations in each of the years 1865, 1866, 1867, and 1868,
                                which said taxes shall be levied and collected as other county taxes
                                are levied and collected, and when so collected shall be applied to
                                the payment of such bonds, orders and appropriations in equal
                                proportion to the amount of such bonds, orders, and appropriations :
                                    Provided, further, that the provisions of this
                                act shall not be construed to cover or include debts contracted by
                                individuals to relieve themselves from any draft that has heretofore
                                taken place, nor shall the same be construed to authorize the
                                assumption or payment of such debts by any county, town or city; but
                                the provisions of this act are intended to apply to the action of
                                counties, towns and cities who have acted through their legally
                                constituted authorities, and have issued their bonds, orders, or
                                other evidences of indebtedness, to raise money to pay bounties to
                                volunteers and drafted men who have entered the military service of
                                the United States, or to maintain and support the families of
                                volunteers, drafted men and substitutes: And provided
                                    further, that where such action shall become necessary or
                                proper to carry into effect the intentions and purposes of this act,
                                it shall be lawful for the Boards of Commissioners of any county, or
                                the municipal authority of any incorporated town or city, which may
                                have issued bonds and orders as aforesaid, to hereafter make such
                                order or orders as may be necessary to confirm, ratify or legalize
                                such bonds and orders, and make them valid, and binding as
                                subsisting debts against such county, town or city.
                            Sec. 3. After the quota of troops now due from this State on the last
                                call of the President of the United States, for three hundred
                                thousand men is filled, it shall be unlawful for any Board of
                                Commissioners of any county, or the municipal authorities of any
                                city or town, of this State, to make any appropriations from their
                                respective Treasuries, or to issue any Bonds, Orders, or other
                                evidences of indebtedness, for the purpose of paying bounties to
                                volunteers, drafted men or substitutes, who have, or may hereafter,
                                enter the military service of the United States.
                            Sec. 4. And be it farther enacted, That all orders
                                and obligations, for the purpose aforesaid, made or entered into by
                                any Township Trustee, and all taxes which have heretofore, or which
                                may hereafter be levied for the payment of such indebtedness, by the
                                Township Trustee, with the approval of the Board of Commissioners of
                                the county, be and the same are legalized and authorized.
                            Sec. 5. It is hereby provided that in all cases of taxes assessed and
                                charged to pay all such debts as are named in this act, on the
                                property of persons who have been, or are now in the Naval, Marine,
                                or Military service of the United States in the present war for
                                suppressing the Southern Rebellion, or their families or
                                descendants, not including substitutes, or those who have not served
                                one year, or those who received bounties from counties to the amount
                                of three hundred dollars or over, the services of such persons so
                                being, or having been, in the military service, shall be deemed
                                equal to such taxes, and said taxes shall be satisfied and
                                discharged on the order of the Board of Commissioners of the proper
                                county, or in vacation of said Board, on the order of the County
                                Auditor: Provided, That the provisions of this
                                section shall not extend to or embrace commissioned officers.
                            
                            SEC. 6. That all laws and parts of laws coming in conflict with the
                                provisions of this art are hereby repealed.
                            SEC. 7. Whereas, an emergency exists for the immediate taking effect
                                of this act; therefore, the same shall take effect and be in force
                                from and after its passage and publication in the Indianapolis Daily
                                Journal and Indianapolis State Sentinel.
                        
                    

                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         WEDNESAY, March 1, 1865.
                    

                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock A. M.
                    The reading of the Secretary's minutes of yesterday's proceedings was
                        commenced, when.
                    On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the further reading thereof was dispensed with.
                    Mr. GIFFORD presented petitions from the White Water Valley, praying for the
                        passage of the bill H. R. 59 [See page 262 of the BREVIER REPORTS ]

                    
                         REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Were concurred in, recommending the passages of House bill 140 (page 169 ) and Senate bills
                            381, (page 294 ) 193 (introduced yesterday,) and 188 (page 317.)
                    
                    
                        RELIEF OF THE FAMILIES OF SOLDIERS AND SEAMEN.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of
                            the special order for this morning, being the relief bill, H. R. 14 see pages 142, 143,144
                            and 145 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, which was read the 2d
                            time.
                        By unanimous consent the bill was amended by providing that the tenure of
                            office shall not exceed two years; and that but one person shall be
                            appointed in each township to disburse the fund.
                        
                        The bill then passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 1.
                        Mr. CASON submitted the following:
                        MR. PRESIDENT: The undersigned beg leave to submit the
                            following protest in relation to the action of the Senate in refusing to
                            concur in the amendment of the Finance Committee to
                            House Bill No. 14, commonly called the Soldiers' Relief Bill, so as to
                            make its application general, instead of discriminating between the
                            families of our soldiers, as done by said bill.
                        Our objections to the bill with this discriminating feature in it are:
                            First; It forces the wives and children of our soldiers to become
                            objects of charity before they can receive the benefits of the bill-a
                            demand which humiliates the recipients of its favors, and degrades them
                            to the level of paupers. In our opinion, if this feature of the bill
                            becomes a law, it will disgrace the fair fame of Indiana, and will be
                            spurned and spit upon by her patriotic soldiers.
                        The second objection to said bill is, that it is impracticable, and
                            cannot be carried out so as to render its operations uniform and
                            just.
                        Its execution being left to township officers, it operation will be as
                            varied as the number of officers dispensing its favors-some townships
                            acting upon the presumption that all soldiers' families are entitled to
                            share the benefits of the measure, when other townships will decide that
                            none except the most indigent and extremely needy families come under
                            the provisions of the bill.
                        And it will, beyond doubt, in many instances, be made the means of
                            dispensing favors on the one hand, and on the other of wreaking petty
                            spite and malice of the officers on some poor and unfortunate soldier's
                            family.
                        The third objection to the bill is, that by its discriminations between
                            the soldiers' families, it will encourage idleness and thriftlessneas
                            among such families of our soldiers who have but little pride of
                            character and are disposed to avoid the hardship of labor. The benefits
                            of the measure are disbursed as a reward for these vices, instead as an
                            encouragement for industry and economy.
                        For these reasons, as well as others not enumerated, we most solemnly and
                            sincerely protest against the passage of the bill with these features
                            engrafted upon it, believing that the worst of consequences must arise
                            therefrom. We would therefore ask that this, our protest, be spread upon
                            the journal.

                        Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Finance, reported in
                            favor of the passage of the bill 153, (see page 179 of these
                            REPORTS.)
                        Mr. WILLIAMS referred to the Governor's message, reading extracts
                            therefrom and favoring the first recommendation made therein concerning
                            this $250,000; but announced that he could not vote for a bill to
                            legalize this transaction.
                        Mr. OYLER The simple question is whether we will saddle upon the Governor
                            the responsibility for these acts, when the money was used in the
                            defense of the people and property of the State? We are in duty bound to
                            pass this bill or play rather a cowardly part by throwing off the State
                            the responsibility of this thing, and allowing it to fall upon the
                            shoulders of one citizen only.
                        Mr. VAWTER proposed to vote for everything necessary to sustain the honor
                            and dignity of the State. But there is a principle in this bill which
                            strikes at the great idea of State rights, and consequently he could not
                            vote for this bill in any of its stages.
                        Mr. CULLEN was not expecting such objections to this bill, and argued to
                            show the legality of the acts of His Excellency, the Governor, in this
                            matter. He could not return to his constituents and feel right until he
                            had voted to sustain Gov. Morton in this matter.
                        Mr. CARSON could not vote intelligently on this subject without
                            understanding the circumstances of the case; which he proceeded to
                            recite and comment upon. He undertook to say that this advancement of
                            $250,000 to the State was made without the expectation of reimbursement,
                            but was a legitimate expenditure made by the General Government under an
                            act of Congress and with which the State as a State has nothing to do.
                            Then why should we identify ourselves with it, and say it is a loan to
                            the State? The honor of the State has nothing to do with this matter.
                            Governor Morton was acting simply as a disbursing agent of the United
                            States, and not under any law of this State.
                         Mr. BENNETT thought this a plain proposition. No one will dispute the
                            fact that this money was used for a proper purpose, and it could have
                            been obtained from no other source than the United States. A failure to
                            pass the bill would place the
                            Governor in the position of a defaulter to the United States. The
                            question of State rights and State sovereignty has nothing to do with
                            this question. He looked upon it as a question of right and honor.
                        Mr. HORD could not see the connection of this bill with this Legislature,
                            neither could he see that the dignity and honor of the State was
                            effected by this act; nor that the Governor would be a defaulter if the
                            bill was not passed. He read from the Governor's message to show that
                            the Governor was not asking for the passage of the bill. The idea of the
                            State paying $250,000 which is not asked of it, and which it is not
                            legally held for, is something that he would like to have explained. 
                        Mr. CASON understood that Indiana to-day owes the General Government the
                            amount of the money referred to, and that Indiana is legally and morally
                            bound to repay it. If we say the contrary, we do injustice to our sister
                            States. It seemed to him, gentlemen would spurn the idea of receiving
                            this money from the general government, and not returning it. And if a
                            settlement for it has to be made, we cannot provide a better way than is
                            proposed in this bill, because the session has approached too its close.
                            He read from the Governor's message under the head of "Military
                            Expenses," to show that His Excellency regarded this sum as an advance
                            made to the State. Either Governor Morion or the State of Indiana has to
                            return this money to the General Government. 
                        Mr. COBB could draw no inference from the act of Congress appropriating
                            this money, that reimbursement was expected. It is the duty of the
                            General Government to protect her citizens,and this money was expended
                            for their protection. The only true way to get along with this, is the
                            Governor to show to the General Government how he has expended this
                            money, and make his settlement as a disbursing agent,which be
                            acknowledges himself to be. He spoke at some length against the passage
                            of the bill.
                        Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate. It was ordered and 43 Senators
                            answered.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual motion to dispense with further
                            proceedings under the call.
                        The Doorkeeper was directed to bring in the absentees.

                        On motion of Mr. BRADLEY, his bill, 143, (see page 165,) was read the third time and passed, by
                            yeas 41, nays 0.

                        On motion by Mr. OYLER, further proceedings under the call of the Senate
                            were dispensed with.
                        The question then recurring on concurring in the committee report on the
                            bill, H. R. 153-see page 179 of Brevier Reports--
                        
                        Mr. VAWTER made an ineffectual motion to adjourn affirmative 17, negative
                            21.
                        Mr. VAWTER moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill till
                            to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
                        
                         On motion by Mr. RICHMOND, the motion to postpone was laid on the table
                            by yeas 22, nays 18.
                        
                         Mr. VAWTER made an ineffectual demand for a call of the
                            Senate--affirmative 18 negative 21.
                         Mr. CORBIN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.
                        The report of the committee on the bill H. R. 153, was then concurred in,
                            by yeas 21 nays 17--as follows:

                                    Resolved, That the State Librarian be

                                        furnished by him for the use of the Senate the present

                        Mr. CORBIN offered the following:

                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. GAFF, his Dearborn Common Pleas bill 195, (introduced yesterday ) was
                            read the second and third times under a dispensation of the
                            Constitutional provision, and passed the Senate by yeas 38, nays 0.

                        
                            COMMON PLEAS COURTS IN RUSH AND ADJACENT
                                COUNTIES.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the bill S. 66 (see page 85,) was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading.
                        
                        
                            WHITE WATER VALLEY CANAL.
                            
                            The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for
                                this hour, being the bill H. R. 59. (See page 262 of these
                                Reports.)
                            Mr. BRADLEY moved that the bill be committed to the
                                    Judiciary Committee, with in-  [in]structions to report whether the
                                exception intended to be made of the Wabash and Erie Canal would be
                                held valid or constitutional in a suit at law; and said committee be
                                requested to report immediately.
                            Mr. OYLER. It is well known that no committee of this Senate has
                                examined this bill as yet, and consequently he favored the motion to
                                refer.
                            On motion of Mr. HANNA, the motion to recommit was laid on the table
                                by yeas 22, nays 20 as follows:

                                    Committee was rejected.
                            The bill was read the second time.
                            Mr. COBB demanded a call of the Senate.
                            It was ordered, and being taken, the Clerk reported but two Senators
                                absent without leave.
                             The Doorkeeper was directed to bring in the absentees.

                            On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill
                                    H. R. 20, was read the second and third time,under a
                                dispensation of the constitutional provision, and passed by yeas 44,
                                nays 1.
                            Mr. BEESON, from the Committee on Agriculture,
                                returned the bill S. 194, (introduced yesterday,) without
                                recommendation.
                            Mr. RICHMOND, as a minority of said committee, reported verbally in
                                favor of the passage of the bill.
                        
                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK it was 
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate adjourn,
                                            it adjourn to meet to-morrow morning at 9 o'clock. 
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        
                            THE WHITEWATER VALLEY CANAL.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. COBB, farther proceedings under the call of the
                                Senate, were dispensed with.
                            Mr. CULLEN moved to amend the bill as follows:
                            Amend section 1, as follows:
                            Strike out the words in the sixth line, "on such terms and conditions
                                and for such compensation as shall be mutually agreed on between
                                such railroad and canal company."
                            And in line seventeen, strike out the words, "with which a canal
                                company may contract," and insert in lieu thereof the following
                                words: "So purchasing such canal in reality, or any part thereof,
                                its rights of way, privileges or appurtenances."
                            Add the following as section 2:
                            SEC. 2. In making sale of any canal in this State, or of its real or
                                personal estate, its rights of way, or any part thereof, the Board
                                of Directors of the said canal shall first give public notice for
                                four weeks in the newspapers published in the counties thereof in
                                which said canal runs, of the time and place of said sale; which
                                shall be at pubic outcry, as real estate is sold on execution, and
                                the proceeds shall be applied in liquidation of all lien debts of
                                said canal company in their order according to law; and the surplus,
                                if any, applied pro rata to the general debts of
                                said company.
                            Mr. CULLEN thought that there was no bill of this session of so much
                                importance as the one under consideration but what had been acted
                                upon by a committee of this Senate. But a short time ago a
                                proposition was made to refer this bill to the Judiciary
                                    Committee to pass upon its constitutionality, and that
                                was denied. The history of this bill was extraordinary and
                                unprecedented; it is crowded upon us in advance of other bills of
                                far more importance. If this bill should be passed, it will be
                                pronounced unconstitutional and void, for it proposes to divest a
                                certain class of citizens of their rights guaranteed them by law. He
                                was authorized to say that this canal can be sold at public outcry
                                far $250,000, and desired to hear what objections can be urged to
                                such a disposition of it.
                            Mr. HORD insisted that the bill was constitutional, and endeavored to
                                show that the opposition of gentlemen to this bill was not merely as
                                to its constitutionality. He also spoke in opposition to the
                                amendment proposed for the sale of the canal, and in favor of the
                                passage of the bill.
                            Mr. OYLER was satisfied that the majority had made up their minds to
                                pass this bill, but insisted upon the adoption of the pending
                                amendment. In the passage of this bill we jeopardized from seven to
                                ten millions of dollars interest in the Wabash and Erie Canal, and
                                that is the main point of objection. This bill, unlike every other,
                                has come up for its passage without the action of a committee upon
                                it. 
                            Mr. ALLISON spoke at length in favor of the bill.
                             Mr.BEESON opposed the bill on principle,and set forth reasons
                                therefor at length. 
                            Mr. CORBIN moved to postpone the further consideration of this bill
                                till 10 1/2 o'clock to-morrow, and make it the special order for
                                that hour.
                             On motion of Mr. COBB, the motion to postpone was laid on the
                                table.
                             [The House amendments to the railroad bill, S. 30, were concurred
                                in.] 
                            Mr. OYLER proposed the following amendments to the bill, H R. 59
                                :
                             Sec. --. All rights, franchises or privileges guaranteed or
                                conferred by this act shall be forfeited, and the same shall revert
                                to the original owners of any such canal, if the railroad company or
                                any other corporation or person purchasing such right of way, or
                                privileges, or any part thereof, fail to build and complete such
                                railroad within three years from the date of such purchase.
                             Mr. CULLEN proposed the following additional amendments:
                            Sec.--- No lease, sale, grant or conveyance shall be made to any
                                person whatever, which shall authorize the purchaser to injure or
                                impair the free flow of water for hydraulic purposes, or that shall
                                injure or impair the feeder dams, and feeders of said canal; or
                                injure or impair the bridges across said canal, or the right of way
                                thereof; but said purchaser shall be liable for all damages done by
                                him therein to the person so injured or damaged. 
                            Sec. --- The board of directors of any canal company in this State,
                                (subject to the exceptions and provisions of this act,) shall have
                                the power and authority to lease or sell the right of way of the
                                towpath of said canal, or over the land owned by said canal company,
                                adjacent thereto, or any railroad company for railroad purposes; but
                                no sale, grant, or conveyance, shall be made to any person or
                                corporation of the water bed of said canal, or of the real estate of
                                the same, or any part thereof; unless  the purchaser shall be bound in a
                                penalty of a forfeiture of all rights which this bill provides, to
                                keep up and maintain the present hydraulic power for manufacturing
                                and milling purposes, giving the present lessees the right to renew
                                their leases on fair and reasonable terms, and in accordance with
                                the conditions and terms of their present leases.
                            On motion by Mr. CASON, the further consideration of the bill was
                                made the second special order for to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            SUPERVISORS.
                            
                            
                            On motion of Mr. DOWNEY, his bill, 56 amending sections 20 and 21 of
                                the Supervisor's act of March 5, 1859, was read the third time and

                     The House met at 9 o'clock P. M. 
                    The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to read the journal of yesterday.
                    On motion of Mr. MONTGOMERY, it was approved without reading. 
                    
                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM presented sundry claims memorials, which were referred to the
                                Committee on Claims.
                        Mr. McVEY, Mr. SHUEY, and Mr. SIM, each presented temperance memorials,

                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            returned the General's report on the condition of the Adjutant General's
                            office. The Committee recommended the removal of the Adjutant General's

                            for 1865, and the same amount for 1866.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK the said report was referred again to the
                                Committee on Ways and Means, with instruction to

                            Bill.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned Mr. James' bill [H. R. 41] to legalize sales by guardians

                        He also reported adversely on Mr. Dunham's bill No. 141, giving
                            additional power to Judges and Attorneys in vacations in State
                            prosecutions.
                        He also returned the bill to declare the forfeiture of the right of way
                            of certain railroads, no part of which has been completed, and on which
                            no work has been done for 10 years, recommending its passage. 
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, returned his bill No. 199 (introduced yesterday)
                            recommending its passage.
                        Mr. BOYD, from the Committee on Claims, reported the
                            allowance of the claim of William Braden; and--
                        Mr. EMERSON reported the allowance of the claims of Geo. W. Pitts, John
                            C. Johns, Speigel, Thorns & Co., Merrill & Co., Hawks &
                            Co.
                        Mr. GROVES reported adversely to the claims of E. P. Spellmoth, T. J.
                            Johnson, J. J. Bingham, Mr. Wetmore, J. G. Doughty and others.
                        On motion, Mr. Shoaff, of Allen, had leave of absence on account of
                            sickness.
                        Mr. MAJOR, from the Committee on Fees and Salaries,
                            returned the resolution for raising the salaries of county officers,
                            recommending that it be laid on the table.
                        Also, the resolution with reference to the employment of a clerk to make
                            an abstract of fees and salaries.
                        Mr. BURNES, from the Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges, returned the petition of John Charles and
                            others for the protection of squirrels and small birds, recommending
                            indefinite postponement of the subject, which was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        ARSENAL ACCOUNTS.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE, from the Committee on Public Printing,
                            returned the resolution for authorizing the publication of the Arsenal
                            Reports--recommending the printing of 10,000 copies. In the opinion of
                            the committee the cost thereof will not exceed fifty cents a copy. These
                            reports will be about the size of the Report of the Superintendent of
                            Public Instruction, and contain the exact accounts of each officer of
                            the State with the General Government.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE considered the publication of these reports would be of
                            general advantage. They will be distributed to all the officers of the
                            State. They will contain the accounts of the National Government with
                            Indiana volunteers, and nobody else. Our officers draw their arms from
                            the arsenal, which are charged to them as belonging to the National
                            Government. It was known that these officers have not been able to make
                            a correct account and return of those arms for which they are
                            responsible. These reports contain all tbose accounts. The reports
                            printed by Mr. Bingham were incomplete-erroneous. These complete reports
                            will be of incalculable value to many officers who have done their duty
                            in the field, and are still complicated in their accounts with the
                            General Government.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Does not the General Government furnish the forms for
                            rendering these accounts?
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. He thought not. These reports were not mere forms, but
                            facts as to how (as it may be) Captain Smith's account stands with the
                            Government as to arms.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS would like to have the gentleman to give one example, where
                            these accounts would be of the least advantage to an officer?
                        Mr. WHITESIDE could add little more to what lie had said.
                        
                         Mr. BUSKIRK explained the necessity and value of these reports, giving
                            examples, and alleging the economy of the printing of these accounts, in
                            saving clerk hire.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. The State Arsenal was a State institution. If we print the
                            report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, was not a collection
                            of these accounts of as much public interest and utility, at this time,
                            as the report of that officer.
                        Mr. TRUSLER, If the object is simply for the benefit of officers in the
                            field, he would say that, if those officers do their duty, these reports
                            will be worthless to them. He explained.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The Secretary of War has refused to settle till the office
                            here certifies as to the account of the officer, either in writing or in
                            print. These were not blanks and forms, but the Recounts themselves.
                        Mr. TRUSLER. It was the duty of these arsenal officers to make their
                            reports to the General Government. At the first our officers were at
                            fault, but now they know their duty better.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE. They are intended for those, cases wherein officers did
                            not know their duty.
                        Mr. TRUSLER. A large majority of those were now out of service, and have
                            settled with the Government. He blamed nobody but these officers, when
                            they had failed of their duty. A great many officers had got their
                            accounts in such a fix, that they do not want them published to the
                            world.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK stated Colonel Owen's difficulty in obtaining a
                            settlement--waiting on the Arsenal clerks here.
                        Mr. BRANHAM did not see what good could result to the service from the
                            printing of these accounts. We might print forms as we may, but that
                            would not give ability to the officer, to shape his account. The white
                            paper would be worth more than this book. He was willing to vote all the
                            printing that might be necessary--no more.
                        Mr. CHAMBERS. The only reason for this printing was for information of
                            the public generally. Army officers did not need them would not read
                            them. He gave in detail the captain's duties and responsibilities in
                            this regard, insisting that these printed reports would bo of no benefit
                            in settling their accounts. They would have to obtain written invoices
                            of every drawing of arms and accoutrements. His own accounts of three
                            years and five months were not yet settled, and he himself would not
                            look at these printed accounts. The true difficulty was that officers
                            did not always keep accounts of losses in the field.
                        Mr. SIM. The gentleman from Henry's case was anomalous in his not wanting
                            money and a settlement. He was one man in a million.
                        
                        The report was then rejected--affirmative 20, nays 57.
                    
                    
                        COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted a resolution that the members of the
                                Committee on Education absent from their places
                            by leave of the House, and visiting different localities with a view to
                            the location of the Agricultural College, be allowed expenses,
                            &c.
                        Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend by inserting "actual expenses," and that
                            "they furnish the items."
                        Mr. OLLIMAN moved to lay the resolution on the table. He was one of the
                            committee.
                        The motion was rejected.
                        Mr. Branham's amendment was adopted, and so the resolution was
                            adopted.
                        Mr. WILLIS, from the Committee on Roads, returned Mr.
                            Chambers's bill [H. R. 69 ] to amend sections 1, 10, 11 and 20 of the
                            supervisors' act of March 5, 1859, recommending that it be laid on the
                            table.
                        Mr. BONNER, from the same committee, returned Mr. Rice's bill [H. R. 73,]
                            to amend sections 10, 14 and 20 of the same act, recommending that it be
                            laid on the table, inasmuch as there is a bill before the House on the
                            third reading to the same purport.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, from the select committee thereon, returned the Senate
                            Morgan raid bill No. 15, with an amendment for the appointment of three
                            commissioners instead of one, and making other modifications in the bill
                            to conform to this amendment.
                    
                    
                        MORRISON AND RAY.
                        Mr. WHITESIDE, by consent, from the Judiciary
                                Committee, returned the claim of Morrison & Ray for
                            attorneys' fees in the case of Mary J. Jameson, involving the State's
                            title to the grounds of the Institution for the Education of the Blind,
                            reporting the allowance of $500.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB stated the grounds of the claim. The committee had not asked
                            for $1000 because they thought from the temper of the House it would be
                            defeated.
                        Mr. BOYD. Though the claim might be right and proper, it was impossible
                            fer the Committee on Claims to arrive at that
                            conclusion with the facts before them.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB read from the correspondence between Morrison & Ray and
                            the old Board of Trustees of the Blind Institution, and the action of
                            that Board in 1857 and 1859, with reference to their employment in the
                            case, asking the allowance to these attorneys of $1,000 for said
                            service.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK answered difficulties submitted by Mr. Boyd.
                        Mr. GROVES said the Committee on Claims had looked
                            with suspicion on these claims, because they were five or six years
                            old.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK answered the imputation against the integrity of Morrison
                            & Ray.
                        Mr. McVEY. Was it because these gentlemen were citizens of Indianapolis
                            that gentlemen objected to this claim.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. When it requires three yards of cloth to make a coat,
                            gentlemen seemed desirous to restrict the pattern to a yard and a
                            half.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to increase the allowance to $1,000.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered.
                        
                        The amendment was rejected--yeas 18, nays 67. 
                        Mr. ABBETT proposed to strike out "$500," and insert "$300."
                        It was rejected.
                        
                        The recommendation of the allowance of $500 was concurred in--yeas 63,
                            nays 24; and then  was referred to
                            the Committee on Ways and Means, with
                            instructions.
                        Mr. COFFROTH called for the regular side of business.
                    
                    
                        COMMITTEE ON THE NORTHERN PRISON.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, (by consent) submitted a resolution that the
                            members of the Committee on the Prison North be
                            allowed $25 each for examinations of said prison and the accounts
                            thereof; and that the Committee on Ways and Means
                            incorporate the same into th specific bill.
                        Mr. BRANHAM moved that they be allowed actual expenses--they furnishing
                            the items.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. It had been the custom to make these allowances.
                        Mr. WRIGHT said he was on that committee, and they had free passes and
                            free fare, and plenty of whisky--and many stayed at the ball at
                            night.
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK moved that these committee claims for traveling about be
                            laid on the table.
                        The SPEAKER (Mr. Higgins in the Chair.) The motion was not specific.
                        
                        On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, the resolution of Mr. Gregory was laid on the
                            table-affirmative 52, operative not counted.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted a resolution directing the Adjutant General to
                            report--1st The names of re-enlisted veterans. 2d. The manner in which
                            they were reported for service; and 3d, whether the credits were given
                            by the proper Marshals, and any other information he may have on the
                            subject.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. It was estimated that 2 200 veterans were enlisted here,
                            credited to the State at large, instead of their proper homes. They were
                            sold out.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The resolution covers that.
                        The resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        SPECIFIC BILL.
                        Mr. BRANHAM, from the Committee on Ways and Means,
                            reported a bill [H. R. 200] for an act making specific appropriations
                            for the year 1865, which was passed to the second reading. 
                    
                    
                        RAILROADS.
                        On motion by Mr. WOODS, the regular order of business was dispensed with,
                            and the House took up the consideration of engrossed bills of the House
                            of Representatives.
                        Mr. Reese's equal footing Railroad Bill, No. 9, [see page 45 ] coming
                            up--[the same which failed last week for want of a quorum--]
                        Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Higgins in the Chair,) moved to lay the bill on the
                            table. He desired to debate, but the rules restrained it. By unanimous
                            consent, he stated the objections to it. The friends of the bill ask
                            that all the railroads chartered previous to 1852 shall be permitted to
                            distribute dividends above fifteen per cent This would give
                            encouragement to railroads to charge exorbitantly for freight and
                            fare--to say (nothing about throwing away a source of increase of the
                            common school fund. The railroads were originally regarded as public
                            enterprizes. He would like to get the bill back, so that he might
                            propose such an amendment as would impose the same restriction upon all
                            railroads organized under the General Railroad law. His amendment, was
                            real for information. [It is to the effect that the profits of all
                            railroads above fifteen per cent., and distributed by dividends, shall
                            go to the benefit of the common school fund] If such a section were
                            enforced, he was informed that it would increase the school fund from
                            $100,000 to $200,000 annually.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. (By consent.) The committee held the bill some time under
                            advisement. He gave the instance of the Terre Haute Railroad Company,
                            with its special charter containing these restrictions--how they had
                            distributed a dividend of some forty per cent., and the common schools
                            never got any benefit from it. These old companies, including the
                            Madison and Indianapolis Company, had avoided their dues to the school
                            fund, by "watering" their stock. Since the report of the committee was
                            made, he had thought on the matter, and seemed to come to the conclusion
                            that it was better to compel these special charter railroads to come
                            under the general law, so that they may be brought under the power of
                            legislation.
                        Mr. RICE, (By consent.) Had brought this up because it was a direct and
                            important interest to his locality. The Madison Railroad, the Terra
                            Haute and Richmond Railroad, and the Evansville Railroad, were the old
                            roads with these special charters. They were the pioneer roads to which
                            the State was indebted for its prosperity. They were entitled to stand
                            on an equal footing with those operating under the general law.
                        This restriction was now standing in the way of the Evansville road, and
                            so in the development of the resources of his county. All he asked was
                            justice to his section, and justice to those pioneer railroads. Your
                            labor, your capital, your banks, and your railroads were your own. Those
                            men established the railroad enterprize when it was an experiment. They
                            were not disposed to go under the general law. But this bill would not
                            give them any advantages over other roads.
                        Mr BUSKIRK desired unanimous consent to submit considerations.
                        Mr. PETTIT. The subject was debateable, because the bill failed not for
                            want of a con-constitutional majority, but for want of a quorum.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK submitted considerations in favor of removing the restriction
                            against these three railroads.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Might they not surrender and come under the general law
                            ?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. They might, but he saw no reason why they should. He
                            submitted that these roads would never pay anything into the school
                            fund. He objected to these restrictions when they were not applied to
                            other roads, and to other investments, excepting the national banks and
                            stocks which were exempted from taxation.
                        Mr. WRIGHT would have the restriction removed. If you would lay such a
                            restriction on a steamboat, he would never build one.
                        Mr. BOYD. He was in favor of extending these restrictions to all the
                            roads, because it  would result in
                            keeping the roads in better condition.
                        Mr. MILLER demanded the previous question.
                        Mr. PETTIT moved to lay the bill on the table.
                        
                        The motion was rejected-ayes 32, nays 43.
                        
                        The previous question was pressed, and the bill was rejected--yeas 36,
                            nays 38.
                        Mr. SHUEY moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and to lay the motion
                            to reconsider on the table, pending which--
                        On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, the House took a recess till two o'clock P. M.
                        
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        
                        The SPEAKER announced the unfinished order, viz: Mr. Shuey's motion to
                            lay on the table his motion to reconsider the vote of the rooming by
                            which the House rejected Reece's R. R. Bill No. 9.
                        
                        The House refused to lay the motion on the table--affirmative 34,
                            negative 40.
                        
                        The bill was then reconsidered--affirmative 46, negative 30. And the
                            question recurred on the. passage of the bill.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to make it a special order.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to make it a special order for Monday morning.
                        It was rejected--affirmative 36, negative 42.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK then withdrew his motion.
                         The bill was then rejected--yeas 42, nays 42.
                        Mr. KILGORE asked, but refused to obtain consent to take up Mr. Rhoad's
                            Normal School bill, No. 119.

                        
                            SOLDIERS' DEPOSITIONS, &C.
                            
                            Mr. Newcomb's Military Deposition bill [H. R 32--see page 65] coming
                                up--
                            Mr. NEWCOMB explained its provisions, and stated that it had received
                                the recommendation of the Judiciary
                                Committee.
                            The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                Representatives--yeas 82, nays 2. 
                        
                        
                            PLANK AND GRAVEL ROADS.
                            Mr. Meredith's Plank Road bill [H. R. 49--page 73] coming up--
                            Mr. NEWCOMB desired to add a provision that this increased rate of
                                toll shall continue only two years.
                            Mr. CHAMBERS. It was to increase the rate of load tolls. We should be
                                careful in allowing this increase, as it was connected with the
                                rights of the people.
                            Mr. MEREDITH was willing to have the bill indefinitely postponed for
                                a Senate bill, with about the same provisions.
                            It was postponed accordingly.

                            Mr. Silver's personal property assessment bill:[H. R. 52--see page
                                73] coming up, it was ordered to the third reading, read the third
                                time and passed the House--yeas 67, nays 12.

                            Mr. HOWARD'S Township Trustee bill [H. R. 53--see page 83] coming up,
                                it was ordered to the third reading, read the third time, and passed
                                the House of Representatives--yeas 74, nays 3.

                            Mr. Wood's Calumet Canal bill [H. R. 52 see page 83] corning up--
                            Mr. WOODS explained its provisions--this canal would drain at least
                                20,000 acres of land.
                            
                            The bill was passed the final reading in the House of
                                Representatives--yeas 76, nays 3.
                        
                        
                            RAILROAD DAMAGES.
                            Mr. Coffroth's damages bill, No. 57, to amend the 784th section of
                                the practice act, coming up
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. As the law now stands, the limitation for damages is
                                $5,000. He supposed this bill was intended to affect railroad
                                companies. Heavy damage might affect the solvency of a railroad
                                company.
                            Mr. SPENCER was in favor of the bill. He would have a man recover
                                damages according to the injury received.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. The bill was, that the Court and Jury may fix damages
                                according to the amount of the injuries. It was right that we should
                                leave it to sound discretion, without fixing the maximum or the
                                minimum of damages. This was the only amendment to the present
                                law.
                            Mr. SHUEY'S objection was to the bill's extending the time within
                                which actions may be brought to six years. By it the shrewd lawyers
                                would bring in a flood of actions for damages. We ought not to
                                legislate vindictively against railroads. If he injured his
                                neighbor, the limitation was for three years, for the time in which
                                he may bring his action, and not six.
                            Mr. RICE would let the railroads make what they can, and let the
                                Courts get what they cars out of them.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, had prepared such a bill himself, and was in
                                favor of its passage.
                            
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, demanded the previous question; and under
                                its pressure, the bill passed the House of Representatives--yeas 76,
                                nays 11.
                        

                        
                            INTEREST.
                            Mr. Higgins' interest bill, [H. R. 58--see page 83 of these Reports,]
                                coming up--it was ordered to the third reading, and read the third
                                time.
                            Mr. HIGGINS. It did not change the interest. The only change is that
                                when a man has agreed for and paid usurious interest, he cannot
                                recover it back again.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB explained that it sought to repeal a very good provision
                                of law. You cannot make an offsett in settlement where usurious
                                interest has been paid.
                            Mr. HIGGINS. The Legislature should not offer a premium to men to
                                prove themselves false to their engagements.
                            
                            The bill was passed the House--yeas 65, nays 19.
                        
                        
                            GEO. W. ARCHER.
                            
                            Mr. Rice's joint resolution No.
                                    11, for the relief of Geo. W. Archer, of the county of
                                Clay, coming up--it was read the third time and passed the House of
                                Representatives--yeas 81, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            SHADE TREES.
                            Mr. Thacher's shade trees bill [H. R. 62- -see page 83,] coming up,
                                it was ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.
                            
                            Mr. THACHER explained that it was to protect shade trees, and to
                                empower the corporate authorities of cities and towns to authorize
                                and control the planting of street shade trees, so as to have
                                uniformity.
                            
                            The bill was passed the House--yeas 56, nays 24.

                             On motion by Mr. KILGORE, the pending order was suspended, and the
                                House proceeded to the consideration of Mr. Rhoads's Normal School
                                bill [H. R. 119--see page 158 of these Reports.]
                            Mr. KILGORE and Mr. RHOADS proposed to fill the blank in Section 8
                                with $1,000.The amendment was agreed to.
                            On motion by Mr. KILGORE and Mr. RHOADS it was proposed to allow
                                members of the Board of Trustees five dollars a day--to be paid out
                                of the State Treasury.
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            Mr. COFFROTH showed a discrepancy between the second and third
                                sections-the former contemplating five members of the Board of
                                Trustees, and the latter six.
                            On motion by Mr. RHOADS, the number was fixed at six.
                            Mr. LASSELLE regarded it as a begging bill for grounds and buildings,
                                or funds. This to him was an insurmountable objection.
                            Mr. RHOADS. The bill was not to tax the State for this school. There
                                was a precedent for this in the State of Illinois, resulting in the
                                best Normal school in the United States--at Bloomington--costing the
                                State nothing. There was already a tender of $75,000 for the
                                location of the Indiana Normal School. None would deny the value of
                                a normal school. He believed that none were opposed to locating the
                                agricultural college on the basis of donation. It was a plan at once
                                ingenious, just and economical.
                            Mr. HARRISON suggested clerical errors in section 7, which were
                                concurred in. 
                            Mr. COFFROTH. What section provides for sustaining this school?
                            Mr. RHOADS. The 16th.
                            Mr. SPENCER. Here was a proposition to takeaway $10 000 from the
                                common school fund to educate school marms. He referred to section
                                16. It was just to squander money--nothing else.
                            Mr. KILGORE demanded the previous question, and under it pressure,
                                the bill as amended was ordered to engrossment and third reading,
                                and read the third time.
                            
                            The vote on the final passage was reported--yeas 43, nays 34.
                            So the bill fails for want of 51 votes, and goes again to the
                                calendar.
                        
                        
                            SOLDIERS' RELIEF BILL.
                            The House now took up the Senate amendment to Mr. Branham's bill,
                                    [H. R. No. 14 ] for
                                relief of the families of soldiers and mariners of this State, in
                                the service of the United States, and of those who have died or been
                                disabled in such service, and prescribing the duties of certain
                                officers therein named.
                            The several amendments of the Senate were agreed to--[for which see
                                Senate proceedings ]
                            Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, called for the reading of the Senate
                                amendment with respect to the families of substitutes. He would know
                                whether it excludes the families of substitutes.
                             Mr. BRANHAM. It does not. 
                        
                        
                            OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD.
                            

                            On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, (by consent,) the House took up the Senate
                                Railroad bill, [S. No. 30 ]
                                to authorize regulate and confirm the sale of railroads, &c.
                            Mr. BRANHAM submitted an amendment in the 7th section: Providing that
                                the provisions of this act shall not be so construed as to authorize
                                any Railroad Company to contract with, for and purchase the railroad
                                bed of any railroad already built, and which may cross or intercept
                                any road affected by this act, bat the powers of purchase shall be
                                limited to such roads in the State of Indiana as may cross or
                                intersect the same, and which have not been equipped and operated in
                                whole or in part.
                            The amendment was agreed to.
                            
                            The bill was passed the House as amended--yeas 70, nays 10. 

                        
                        
                            COUNTY BONDS.
                            The House then proceeded to the consideration of the Senate engrossed
                                amendments to the House amendments to the bill [S. No. 3] to legalize County
                                Bonds.
                            On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the first amendment to section four was
                                agreed to.
                            The next amendment was the exemption of soldiers' property from the
                                taxation to pay these bonds, &c., known as the minority
                                amendment reported from the House select committee thereon.
                            Mr. COFFROTH said it would exempt from taxation officers who have
                                been in the army and have now retired.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. On the passage of the School bill negroes'
                                property could be exempted, without any dread of unconstitutional
                                legislation. He demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK appealed to the gentleman to withdraw the demand. He
                                offered an amendment, which he desired to have read for
                                information.
                            Mr. MILLER adhered to the demand for the previous question-but there
                                was not a second--affirmative 32. negative 50.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to add to the Senate section these words:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Provided, That the provisions of this
                                            section shall not be construed so as to embrace
                                            commissioned officers.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. NEWCOMB hoped the amendment would be agreed to.
                            Mr. LOCKHART made an ineffectual demand for the previous
                                question.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK feared that the Senate amendment would be adopted. If it
                                should be, he wanted the amendment which he had submitted. Without
                                it, the bill would exempt the property of the gentleman from Floyd,
                                the gentleman from Henry, the gentleman from Delaware, the
                                gentleman, from Fayette, and others, who were as able and willing
                                and as much entitled to pay taxes as any of us.
                            Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, objected to a bill that would exempt four-fifths
                                ot his constituents in townships. He objected to the passage of the bill on account of this
                                manifest injustice.
                            
                            Mr. Buskirk's amendment was agreed to--yeas 70, nays 13.
                            Mr. LOCKHART moved and the House ordered a night session at 7 1/2
                                o'clock P. M.
                            Mr. OLLEMAN proposed to fix the time of meeting at 8 o'clock
                                to-morrow morning.
                            It was so ordered.
                            The vote on Mr. Buskirk's motion to disagree to the Senate's
                                amendment, as amended, resulted-yeas 36, nays 51-as follows:

                            The House having refused to disagree it is equivalent to concurrence.
                            
                        
                        
                            ANDREW CRAWFORD, A. T. WHITTLESEY.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK submitted a resolution, which was adopted, allowing A.
                                Crawford and A. T. Whittlesey each $4 a day and mileage for services
                                in the organization of the House of Representatives--1863 and
                                1865--and Frank Costigan and E. P. Wilson each $20 for a diagram of
                                the floor of the House.
                            Mr. LANE moved to take up the Temperance bill No. 139, and make it a
                                special order for tomorrow 10 o'clock.
                            
                            The motion was rejected--affirmative 23, negative 42. And then, at
                                6:05 P. M.,
                            The House adjourned till to-morrow morning 8 o'clock.

                        THURSDAY, March 2, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 9 o'clock. A M.
                    On motion by Mr. DUNNING, the reading of the Secretary's journal of yesterday
                        was dispensed with.
                    
                        SWAMP LANDS.
                        Mr. TERRY submitted the following:
                         Mr. PRESIDENT: The Committee on Swamp
                                Lands, to whom was referred the petition of Joseph E.
                            Smith and others, praying that said Joseph E. Smith be empowered to
                            relinquish his title to certain swamp lands by him entered, and to enter
                            other swamp lands in lieu thereof, and have had the same under
                            consideration, and being of unanimous opinion that this General Assembly
                            is not authorized to trade in lands, have instructed me to report the
                            petition to the Senate, and recommend that it lay on the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        A TEMPERANCE LAW.
                        Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following:
                        Mr. PRESIDENT: The Judiciary
                                Committee, to which was referred Senate bill No. 142, (see
                            page 165 of these reports,) defining the crime of drunkenness, and
                            prescribing the penalty therefor, have had the same under consideration,
                            and a majority have instructed me to report the same back to the Senate,
                            with the following amendment, and when so amended,they recommend its
                            passage. Strike out the bill from the enacting clause, and insert the
                            following:
                         "Every person who shall, on any street, sidewalk, or highway, or in any
                            railroad car, railroad depot, or other public building or place, be
                            found intoxicated with liquor, so as to be noisy, insulting or
                            quarrelsome, or so as to stagger or fall, in consequence thereof, shall
                            be deemed guilty of public drunkenness, and on conviction thereof shall
                            be fined in any sum not exceeding ten dollars."
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        NATIONAL STATUARY.
                        Mr. DUNNING submitted the following:
                         Mr. PRESIDENT: The select
                                committee to which was referred the message of the
                            Governor, and the accompanying documents, in reference to furnishing
                            statues by the State of Indiana, not exceeding two in number, for a
                            "National Statuary Hall'' in the old hall of this House of
                            Representatives at Washington City, D. C , have had the same under
                            consideration.
                         The committee have instructed me to report that they appreciate the
                            importance of the subject matter referred to them, and believe that
                            Indiana numbers amongst her deceased state-men, who are "illustrious for
                            their historic renown," and also for their "civic and military
                            services," many names worthy the high standing of Indiana amongst her
                            sister States of the Union, who are worthy of the high honor
                            contemplated by the act of Congress. Nevertheless, the late period of
                            the session at which the message was received, and the great press of
                            unfinished business now before the Legislature, as well as the
                            difficulty and delicacy in making a selection, admonish the committee
                            that it would be proper to report the message and accompanying documents
                            back to the Senate, and ask that the further consideration of this
                            matter be postponed for the action of a future Legislature, the
                            committee recommend that the subject be laid upon the table.
                        The report was concurred in.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        The Judiciary Committee reported in favor of the
                            Agricultural College bill, S.
                            119, (see ppge 138.)
                        On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the bill was read a second time and ordered to
                            be engrossed.
                        The committee on claims reported favorably on the
                            following accounts:
                        Henry Rees, for salt, &c., $5 60; E. W. Brown, clock railing,
                            repairing locks, &c., $12; Jones, Vinnedge & Jones, one dozen
                            brooms, $5; Tousey, Byram & Co., for matting, &c., $44 28;
                            toweling, $3 25, shears, &c., $2 35.
                        Mr. STAGGS from the select committee thereon, returned his bill, 102, for
                            the relief of A. W. Loudermilk, with a report that further legislation
                            thereon was inexpedient.
                        The reports were concurred in. 
                    
                    
                        COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.
                        Mr. OYLER moved that the Committee on the Judiciary be
                            instructed to report back all bills concerning the reorganization of
                            Courts, with recommendations that they lie on the table.
                        Mr. CARSON would desire time to consider such bills if it were proposed
                            by their friends to pass them, and was of opinion there was not the
                            necessary time in this session to legislation on this subject.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, would oppose any revolution of the present court
                            system would favor certain changes in the jurisdiction of courts.
                        
                        Mr. ENGLISH was opposed to any change at time in the present probate
                            system of our State. 
                        Mr. HORD opposed the motion. He was of pinion that the Common Pleas Court
                            should be abolished.
                        Mr. NILES was satisfied that another system could be inaugurated much
                            mere satisfactory and less expensive.
                        Mr. BENNETT believed a majority of the Senate would be in favor of bills
                            abolishing the Courts of Common Pleas.
                        The motion was agreed to.
                    
                    
                        COUNTY AND OTHER BONDS.
                        On motion by Mr. HANNA, the Senate took Up the House amendment to the
                                bill S. 3, providing that the
                            property of commissioned officers shall not be exempt from taxation
                            under the bill.
                        Mr. OYLER looked upon the amendment as unrighteous and unjust. He
                            expected to vote for the amendment, at the same time protesting against
                            its adoption. He realized the insult, stigma and wrong done to the
                            officers of Indiana by this amendment.
                        Mr. BENNETT would vote for the amendment, because he was anxious for the
                            passage of the bill. He would forego his objections, many of which have
                            not been named. 
                        Mr. RICHMOND considered the amendment an outrage upon the Senators from
                            Union, Johnson and himself, all of whom enlisted as privates, and rose
                            to the command of a regiment.
                        
                         The House amendment was agreed to by yeas 31, nays 16. 
                    
                    
                        THE SINKING FUND.

                        On motion by Mr. RICHMOND, the bill [H. R. 47,] to increase the power of
                            the Sinking Fund Commissioners, &c., was read the first time, and by
                            title again, and then referred to the Committee on
                                Finance.
                    
                    
                        THE PRESIDENT'S ADVANCE OF $250,000.

                        On motion by Mr. HANNA, the Senate proceeded to the special order for
                            this hour, being the bill H. R. 153, (see page 179 of the B. R.,) which
                            bill was read the third time.
                        Mr. BEESON. The bill does but a simple act of justice as between the
                            State of Indiana and her Executive. He gave reasons why that bill should
                            pass without serious opposition.
                        Mr. OYLER also urged upon Senators the importance of passing this bill.
                            He desired to keep bright the escutcheon of the State. Had not these
                            acts been performed by our Governor, the Benevolent Institutions of the
                            State could not have been maintained, our Courts would have been shut up
                            and everything: that kept the Government in motion would have been
                            stopped.
                        Mr. CORBIN. regarded this as a matter of much moment in many respect, not
                            because of the money in it, but because of the principle involved. He
                            drew a parallel between this bill and the Morgan raid bill; and it was
                            upon the same principle he had opposed both bills.
                        Mr. CULLEN was certain of the fact that there was a legal and moral
                            responsibility resting upon the Senate to pass this bill; and argued the
                            legal points of the question. Had the General Government advanced this
                            money to any other person than Governor Morton, he believed there would
                            have been no opposition to the passage of this bill. The honor of
                            Indiana depended upon the getting of this money. There never was a
                            greater necessity for any act on earth than there was for the General
                            Government to step forward and advance to us the money. He contended
                            that the vouchers were all in the name of the great State of Indiana;
                            the money had been expended for his benefit, and she alone can settle
                            properly with the General Government. He spoke till the ususal hour for
                            adjournment and gave way for that motion. 
                        And then came the recess for dinner. 
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        Mr. CULLEN resumed the floor and continued his remarks in favor of the
                            passage of the bill.
                        Mr. VAWTER performed a painful duty in opposing the passage of the bill.
                            To vote for this bill would make him untrue to the political principles
                            which he had learned, and to which he has been devoted ever since he had
                            any conception of governments. The friends of this measure, by their
                            argument, admit that the action of the Governor was in this respect
                            unauthorized, and yet we are asked to endorse that unauthorized act.
                            Gentlemen tell us that a portion of this money was used to give
                            refreshment to soldiers, and to bring home sick soldiers. I say to the
                            gentlemen of the opposition that if they will introduce a bill
                            appropriating money to care for soldiers, whether in the field,
                            hospital, or at home, that bill shall pass before this time to-morrow,
                            endorsed by the vote of every Democrat in this General Assembly. When
                            gentlemen state that the Democratic members of this Senate are opposed
                            to appropriations for the benefit of the soldiers they mistake the
                            record. These gentlemen know that every Democratic Senator has
                            repeatedly assured them that they will vote every dollar necessary for
                            the soldiers, whether the same be cents, dollars, hundreds, thousands,
                            or millions, of dollars. But the gist of this matter is, shall we step
                            in and make the disbursing agent of the United States our agent? Shall
                            we, even by implication by the passage of this bill, assume that Mr.
                            Lincoln improperly made a disbursing agent; that that disbursing agent
                            improperly exercised his power. Let Governor Morton settle with his
                            superior, Mr. Lincoln. If he has used any of this money for improper
                            purpose, and Mr. Lincoln will not endorse the acts of his agent, then
                            will be time for us to examine the question, how much of this improper
                            conduct we must assume. But I say to gentlemen, that if Governor Morion
                            has violated his duties as agent, and Mr. Lincoln repudiates those
                            violations, and if it shall appear that this money was used for our
                            soldiers, then I will vote to reimburse such sums.
                        Mr. BENNETT occupied the attention of the Senate for some time in favor
                            of the passage of the bill. When he had concluded--
                        Mr. CULLEN demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered, and being taken, five Senators were reported as absent
                            without leave.
                        
                         On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK the absentees were sent for.
                        Mr. DOWNEY moved to recommit the bill with the following
                            instructions:
                        Amend as follows:1st. Strike out the whole of the preamble.
                        2d. Strike out the bill from enacting clause insert in lieu thereof the
                            following:
                        1st That the expenditure of the sum of one hundred and thirty four
                            thousand five hundred and twelve dollars and sevety-two cents ($134,512
                            72,) made by O. P. Morton, Governor of this State out ot the two hundred
                            and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) advanced to him by the President
                            of the United States, for the purposes of the State be and the same is
                            hereby ratified and legalized.
                        2d. That the said O. P. Morton, Governor of the State, be and he is
                            hereby authorized, by the consent of the President of the United States,
                            to pay into the Treasury of the State the sum of one hundred and fifteen
                            thousand four hundred and eighty-seven dollars and twenty-eight cents
                            ($115,487 28.) balance of said sum, two hundred and fifty thousand
                            dollars, to be accounted for to the President, or other proper authority
                            of the United States, with the said sum expended as aforesaid. But
                            nothing in this act shall be construed so as to imply the existence of
                            rebellion in this State at any time, or an unwillingness of the art of
                            the State to provide for the full payment of all her obligations, and
                            the discharge of all her duties as a loyal State of the Union.
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, further proceedings under the call were
                            dispensed with.
                        Mr. COBB made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT the motion to recommit was laid on the table by

                        So the motion to recommit was laid on the table.
                        
                        The bill then failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority by
                            yeas 25, nays 24--the same vote as just recorded.
                        Mr. BENNETT moved to take up the bill again.
                        
                        Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion--yeas 21, nays 28--to lay this motion
                            on the table.
                        The Senate agreed to the motion to take up the bill again by yeas 27,

                        Mr. DOWNEY moved to reconsider the vote by which his motion to recommit
                            was laid on the table.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. OYLER this motion was also laid on the table by yeas 25,
                            nays 24.
                        Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Senate at length in favor of the passage of
                            the bill.
                        Mr. HANNA announced that there was much legislation necessary to be done
                            here, but the opposition had discussed this bill all day, and if they
                            placed their pet measures as a blockade upon farther proceedings here,
                            his, friends would meet them at Philippi. There is no excuse for delay
                            one hour longer, and he asked why are gentlemen so determined that no
                            other legislation shall go on?
                        Mr. CULLEN on yesterday had no idea that there was a Senator on this
                            floor who would refuse concurrence in the House bill, but now he would
                            say for himself that nothing can come before this Senate till this shall
                            be disposed of. He was willing to meet the gentleman at Philippi, and to
                            take breakfast, dinner and supper, aye, and sleep with him there. He was
                            not willing to pass over this important bill for less important
                            measures, and for one be would insist on the final disposition of this
                            bill before anything else shall come before the Senate.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS rose to a point of order, viz: That there is no rule which
                            authorizes a second vote on a bill that fails for want of a
                            constitutional majority.
                        Pending which--

                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK it was--
                            
                                
                                    
                                         Resolved, That when the Senate
                                            adjourn, it adjourn to meet to-morrow morning st 9
                                            o'clock.
                                    
                                
                            
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        THURSDAY, March 2, 1865.
                    
                     The SPEAKER took the chair at 9 o'clock A. M., and directed the roll-call to
                        determine a quorum.
                    On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the reading of the journal of yesterday was
                        dispensed with.
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, from the Committee on Ways and
                                Means; returned his treasury bill [H. R. 195] with an
                            amendment, inserting formal words after the title, and so recommending
                            its passage.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
                            returned the bill (S. 63,) with
                            amendments, striking out and inserting new matter after the enacting
                            clause prohibiting all judges and county officers and their deputies
                            from practicing law in any of the courts of the State, except as in this
                            act provided, and providing a penalty of $500, and, so amended,
                            recommending its passage.
                        He also reported a House bill on the same matter, recommending that it be
                            laid on the table.
                    
                    
                         PUBLIC EXPENDITURES.
                        Mr. HIGGINS, from the Committee on Public
                            Expenditures, reported their examination of vouchers for the
                            expenditure of public moneys. The report states, that the disbursing
                            officers have paid out $2,808 90 more than was by law appropriated. The
                            money paid for the public printing for the last two years amounts to
                            $70,035 90. The Committee recommended that a check be put upon these
                            useless and wasteful disbursements-alleging that a great many orders
                            were made for printing by the Legislature which were altogether useless.
                            The Committee recommend a uniform rate of Sheriff fees for conveying
                            convicts to the peni - 
                            [peni]tentiary; and that nothing be drawn from the School Fund under the
                            control of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, except. &c.
                        Mr. ABBETT, Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. LOCKHART and Mr. BRANHAM had leave to
                            present claims.
                    
                    
                        NORTHERN PRISON.
                        Mr. HIGGINS, from the Select Committee on Mr. Wright's
                            resolution for converting the Northern Prison into a House of Refuge,
                            reported that said committee, after a thorough examination find that the
                            buildings of said prison have been erected with the design of making it
                            a first class prison; and that the project of making it a House of
                            Refuge is impracticable and inexpedient; and that the committee be
                            discharged from the further consideration of the subject. 
                    
                    
                        CLAIMS.
                        
                        Mr. BOYD, (by consent,) from the Committee on Claims,
                            reported adversely on certain claims of Merrill & Co., A. P.
                            Newkirk, J. T. Smith, N. F. Cunningham, J. Mother, Lynch and others.
                        He recommended the allowance of the claims of Hall & Hutchinson,
                            Munson & Johnson, McDonald & Roach.
                        He reported on the petition of Jacob Bramwell for the Jefferson County
                            Agricultural Society, recommending that it take the same course of
                            Morgan and other rebel raid claims, provision for which are being made
                            in a bill now before the House.
                        Mr. SHUEY, from the Committee on Claims, reported the
                            allowance of the claims of Peter Wilkins, J. L. Sailor, and Tousey &
                            Byram.
                        Mr. SHUEY, from the Committee on Temperance, returned
                            to the files sundry petitions, asking for a stringent liquor law,
                            reporting for answer thereto, recommendation of the passage of his bill
                            [H. R. No. 139--see page 169 of these Reports.]
                    
                    
                        INDIANA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
                        
                        Mr. BURTON, (by consent,) from a minority of the Committee on
                                Education, submitted a minority report relative to the
                            establishment of an Agricultural College, taking issue with the majority
                            of the committee as to the location thereof, and recommending that said
                            college be established (if any where) in connection with the State
                            University at Blooming-ton; showing at length the advantages of that
                            location over any other. The report being very lengthy, he was willing,
                            by consent of the House, that it be laid on the table, without reading,
                            with the understanding that it be taken up and considered in connection
                            with the majority report, when the House shall take action on the
                            bill.
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB and Mr. BUSKIRK, it was accordingly laid on the
                            table.
                    
                    
                        DEARBORN COMMON PLEAS.
                        On motion of Mr. FERRIS, the House now took up the consideration of the
                            bill (S. 195) to legalize
                            proceeding in the Dearborn county Common Pleas Court in February, 1865;
                            and the same was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        On his further motion, (the constitutional restriction being suspended
                            for the purpose--yeas 77, nays 0,) the bill was read a second time by
                            title, and ordered to the third reading.
                        On motion by Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe, the House took up the
                            consideration of the bill (S.
                                168) fixing the times of holding the Circuit Courts in the
                            12th Judicial Circuit, and the same was read and passed to the second
                            reading.
                    
                    
                        THE PUBLIC DEBT.
                        Mr. BRANHAM (by leave) introduced a bill [H. R No. 201] for an act to
                            provide for the adjustment of the outstanding debts of the State, and
                            the investment of the school and trust funds of the State in stocks and
                            bonds of the State, and to provide for the payment of the certificates
                            of indebtedness of the State, under the arrangement made with the
                            bondholders, by the acts of the Legislature approved January 27, 1847;
                            and to create a Board of Finance, and prescribing the duties of said
                            board, and matters properly connected therewith;
                        Which was passed to the second reading.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, it was ordered that 500 copies be printed--150
                            copies for the Senate, and 350 for the House.
                    
                    
                        UNIFORM RAILROAD RATES.
                        Mr. LOCKHART moved, and the House took up Mr. Reese's Railroad bill [H.
                            R. 30-see page 65]--it requiring railroads to charge uniform rates for
                            freight and fare. [The penalty is $20 to $100, not exceeding $500 ]
                        It was read the second time, with amendments reported from the
                                Committee on Railroads.
                        The committee amendments were adapted.
                        Mr. SHUEY. The bill proposes that railroads may charge 15 per cent, more
                            for way freight than for through freight. He thought it should be 25 or
                            30 per cent--enough to pay for the paper on which the bills are
                            written.
                        Mr. LOCKHART. The committee were reluctant to go as far as 15 per cent.
                            He explained.
                        Mr. SHUEY. There was not a more firm friend of the bill in the House; but
                            he wished to avoid extremes.
                        Mr. BRANHAM was well satisfied that gross impositions had been practiced.
                            He would have the bill referred to a select committee; but he would not
                            be a member of it.
                        Mr. HENRICKS suggested an amendment reasonable rates for way freight.
                        Mr. WOODS proposed to add: "All railroads of the State shall have a Board
                            of Directors and an office within the State."
                        Mr. KILGORE preferred immediate action. He would make but a small
                            discrimination between local and through freights.
                        On motion of Mr. LOCKHART it was referred to a select committee of
                            five.
                    
                    
                         SHERIFFS' FEES.
                        

                        On motion of Mr. SIM the bill [S. No.
                                184] to amend section 5 of the set of March 2, 1855,
                            regulating Sheriff's fees, [Raising fees-Sheriff's shall not be allowed
                            fees on service by deputies when said deputies are receiving pay by the
                            day in the county where the service is rendered.]
                        Mr. BROWN. It was but right and proper that the bill should be passed. He
                            asked that it be read the second time now.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. It had received the careful attention of the Senate.
                        
                        
                         It was then declared expedient to suspend the constitutional
                            restriction, by yeas 79, nays 0--and the bill was read the second time
                            and ordered to the third reading. 
                        

                        On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the constitutional restriction was again
                            suspended-yeas 82, nays 0; and the bill was read the third time and
                            passed the House of Representatives-yeas 73, nays 3.

                    
                    
                        MR. LASSELLE.
                        Mr. COFFROTH rose to a question of privilege, having reference to the
                            appointment of the select committee, raised by the resolution of Mr.
                            Miller, of Tippecanoe, with reference to Mr. Lasselle's right to a seat
                            on the floor of the House on account of his connection with a certain
                            secret political order; and on account of the pressure of business near
                            the end of the I session, the moved, as a member of that committee, that
                            the committee be discharged from the further consideration of the
                            subject.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, explained and asked till Monday for action on
                            withdrawal of the resolution. He would like to have the committee come
                            together, and at least report that we have not had time to make
                            examinations before asking to be discharged.
                        The committee was discharged accordingly. 
                    
                    
                        COMMON SCHOOLS.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the order of business was further suspended,
                            and the House took up the consideration of the bill [H. R. 199] for the
                            distribution (instead of the landing) of the interest on the sinking
                            fund and other funds belonging to the common schools, and repeal,
                            &c. It was passed to the second reading.
                        
                        On his further motion, the Constitutional restriction was suspended--yeas
                            70, nays 0--and the bill was considered as engrossed, ordered to the
                            third reading, read the third time and passed the House of
                            Representatives-yeas 84, nays 0.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the House took up the consideration of his
                            bill, [H. R. 187,] (with reference to the same matter,) requiring the
                            Commissioners of the State Debt Sinking Fund to make settlement with the
                            Sinking Fund Commissioners, &c., (see page 304.).
                        The bill was read the second time.
                        Mr. DUNHAM did not think it right to account to the fund for the face of
                            the paper. He would strike out "par value," and insert a clause to issue
                            the bonds of the State for the prices paid for these stocks.
                        Mr. BRANHAM preferred that common schools should be benefitted by this
                            bill, instead of the State. These stocks were worth 90 cents. He would
                            increase the sources of the support of the schools, so as to avoid tax,
                            &c.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. He objected to tying up so large a State debt. Under this
                            bill, the State is committed to pay this, without contingency. It would
                            be sufficient to simply reimburse the schools for what is actually paid
                            out.
                         Mr. NEWCOMB explained the provisions of the bill.
                        The amendment was rejected.
                        
                         On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, (the constitutional restriction being
                            suspended for the purpose--yeas 81, nays 2--) the bill was considered as
                            engrossed, ordered to the third reading, read the third time and passed
                            the House of Representatives--yeas 73, nays 5.
                    
                    
                        CLERKS OF COURTS.
                        Mr. Speaker PETITT (Mr. Higgins in the the Chair,) asked unanimous
                            consent to take up his bill [No. 156] imposing on clerks of the circuit
                            courts the duty of preparing applications for back pay, back pay and
                            bounties, balance of bounties, half pay and pensions, [see page 185 of
                            these Reports.]
                        Mr. P. proceeded to state the provisions of the bill--precribing a
                            uniform clerk fee of one dollar.
                        It then provides that the papers shall be transmitted to Washington and
                            the claims paid and returned through the Circuit Court Clerks without
                            fees. It is to avoid the system of brigandage which has grown up in
                            regard to these claims in which over 100,000 volunteers are all
                            interested.
                        Mr. RICE objected.
                        On the motion of Mr. PETTIT, the order of business was
                            suspended--affirmative 53, negative 15--and the bill No. 156 was taken
                            up and read the second time.
                        Mr. PETTIT moved to amend by inserting an enacting clause.
                        Which was agreed to.
                        Mr. PETTIT moved to fill the blank (salary for the agent at Washington)
                            with $2,500.
                        Mr. SPENCER, saw no necessity for this legislation. The law of Congress
                            was complete in this regard, and the man that disregards it is subject
                            to fine.
                        Mr. RICE concurred with the gentleman from Posey [Mr. Spencer.] The
                            Clerks would have to employ extra deputies. It was a wrong to require
                            the Clerks to do this for inadequate fees. Each case might require four
                            or five different applications. Then half these cases would perhaps
                            require new application on account of the ruling in the Department at
                            Washington.
                        Mr. SPENCER. Congress allows $10 for what this bill allows but $1.
                        Mr. RICE The agent at Washington would have to employ a corps of clerks
                            who would have to be paid at a very heavy rate. He was for the bill, if
                            it could be perfected by making it a State matter, providing for
                            penalties against the sharks in this business of soldiers' claims.
                        Mr. BURWELL had some experience in this matter, and regarded the bill as
                            unnecessary and sure to prove expensive.
                        Mr. PETTIT. In the act of Congress there was no restriction upon the fee
                            for application for back pay and bounty. But he was corrector by Mr.
                            Spencer in this. He then answered the objections. It was no matter of
                            difficulty to fill twenty or thirty applications in a day; it
                            contemplated that the applicant shall be present with his witnesses. It
                            might prove an augmentation of three or four hundred dollars a year to
                            the compensation of the Clerk. But the great object of the bill was to
                            have early attention to all applications. It would shorten the time from
                            ten or twelve months to perhaps three or four months. The presence of
                            the  agent would command the
                            attention of the Department at Washington.
                        Mr. COFFROTH had misgivings as to the Washington agency; but, upon the
                            whole, he thought it best to try it a year or two. He spoke in favor of
                            the bill, answering objections by Mr. Rice and Mr. Spencer. He would not
                            fall into the error of inflicting the oppression of which our fathers
                            complained, of "sending swarms of officers to harrass our minds and eat
                            out our subsistence;" but he thought we ought to afford this one officer
                            more for the benefit of those who have imperilled their lives for their
                            country. 
                        Mr. CHAMBERS was in favor of providing by law for these claimants to get
                            their dues without the unreasonable charges to which they were now
                            subjected. He would have a man in each county to attend to this
                            business. He did notice the intermediary agent at Washington.
                        Mr. SPENCER said that under this bill, the County Clerk would have to
                            take out license as a Claim Agent, and by so doing he would place
                            himself in such a condition that he could not certify to any paper in
                            the application. 
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK took the floor; when--
                        On motion by Mr. BROWN, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                         The SPEAKER resumed the chair at 2 o'clock P. M., and directed the
                            roll-call to determine a quorum. 

                        
                            ACTS AND JOURNALS.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH (by consent) called up the concurrent resolution
                                directing the Clerks of the several Circuit Courts to distribute the
                                acts and journals of the General Assembly to township officers, and
                                such other citizens as his judgment may direct. 
                            It was adopted. 
                        
                        
                            THE HOUSE CLERKS.
                            Mr. KILGORE submitted a preamble and resolution to the effect that
                                Cyrus T. Nixon and the clerical corps of the House be each allowed
                                $2 per day in addition to the compensation already allowed them.
                            Mr. ABBETT. How much is allowed now?
                            The SPEAKER. (Mr. Higgins in the chair.) Five dollars a day.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE. The House clerks had not consumed as much stationery
                                as the clerical corps of the Senate, and as their work had been well
                                and promptly done by a small number, it was no more than right that
                                this allowance be made.
                            
                            It was agreed to-affirmative 46, negative 22.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved the allowance of a dollar a day extra to the
                                Doorkeeper and each member of the police of the House under him.
                            Mr. BRANHAM hoped it would not pass. We could find plenty to take
                                these positions thankfully. He demanded the yeas and nays.
                            Mr. HENRICKS. What do they get now?
                            Mr. BRANHAM. Five dollars a day.
                            The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 28, nays 51.
                            So the resolution was rejected.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved to reconsider the vote increasing the pay of the
                                clerks. He was unwilling to squander the people's money at such a
                                time as this. He had found that the extravagant appropriations for
                                the expenses of the General Assembly, made at the beginning of the
                                session, was insufficient, and the committee had to report an
                                appropriation for the deficiency. He demanded the yeas and nays on
                                the motion to reconsider.
                            Mr. BROWN moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                            Mr. BRANHAM demanded the yeas and nays.
                            
                            The motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table, was
                                rejected-yeas 38, nays 48-and the question recurred on the motion to
                                reconsider.
                            Mr SPENCER thought there was misunderstanding, and hoped the vote to
                                reconsider would be agreed to.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. The present compensation was $5 a day. The resolution
                                was to make it $7. He moved to reconsider wish the purpose to leave
                                it at $5.
                            
                            The vote resulted--yeas 55, nays 27--so the resolution was
                                reconsidered.
                            Mr. BROWN moved to amend, by allowing the gentleman from Jefferson
                                fifty cents a day, as extra compensation for his services as a
                                member, which he subsequently withdrew.
                            Mr. KILGORE moved to amend the resolution by striking out $2 and
                                inserting $1.
                            Mr. BURWELL moved to lay the resolution and amendment on the
                                table.
                            
                            The vote resulted--yeas 43, nays 45; so the resolution was not laid
                                on the table, and the question recurred on the amendment.
                            Mr. BRANHAM moved to strike out all the corps except the Principal,
                                the Assistant and the Reading Clerk; which he subsequently
                                withdrew.
                            Mr. ABBETT. How many Clerks? 
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve or thirteen.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. Only 17 in the Senate.
                             Mr. BROWN moved to include the Doorkeeper and his assistants; and he
                                demanded the previous question.
                            Mr. THACHER demanded a division of the question.
                            There was a second for the previous question. 
                            
                            Mr. BROWN'S amendment was rejected affirmative 27, negative 46
                            Mr. BANTA and Mr. OLLEMAN demanded the yeas and nays.
                            
                            Mr. Kilgore's amendment was adopted--yeas 55, nays 31; and the
                                question recurred on the resolution as amended.
                            Mr. STRINGER and Mr. GLAZEBROOK demanded the yeas and nays.
                            
                            The resolution as amended, was adopted yeas 47, nays 37.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE moved to reconsider the vote just taken, and then to
                                lay his motion on the table.
                            The latter motion was agreed to.
                             Mr. PETTIT called for the order of business--but gave way for--
                        
                        
                            SWAMP LAND BOOKS.
                            
                            Mr. WHITESIDE, who, (by consent) called up the joint resolution [S.
                                No. 11] to authorize the Governor to appoint some suitable person
                                     to revise the swamp land
                                books in the office of the Auditor of State.
                            Mr. WOODS proposed to amend by adding "prosecuted on behalf of the
                                State by the Attorney General, who shall be allowed five per cent,
                                commission on all such moneys recovered by him."
                            Mr. BROWN. It was the business of the Attorney General to prosecute
                                these claims. He objected to offering inducements to public officers
                                to do their duty. He moved to lay the amendment on the table.
                            It was so ordered:
                            So, the joint resolution was passed to the 3d reading.
                        
                        
                            SOLDIERS' CLAIMS.
                            Mr. PETTIT demanded the order of unfinished business, viz: the
                                consideration of his bill, No. 156, Mr. Ferris having demanded the
                                previous question on the bill and amendment.
                            Mr. FERRIS withdrew the demand.
                             On motion of Mr. PEITIT, the Clerk's fee was charged in the bill
                                from "one" to "two" dollars.
                            He then renewed the demand for the previous question.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, desired to move to make the salary of the
                                Agent $2,000. [Cut off by the previous question.]
                            The pending motion to fill the blank pay of Agent, with $2,500,
                                (under the pressure of the previous question,) was then agreed to;
                                and so the bill was ordered to engrossment and third reading
                                to-morrow.
                        
                        
                            AGRICULTURAL FAIRS.
                            On the motion of Mr. HARRISON, his Agricultural Fairs bill [H. R. No.
                                12, see p. 45,] with the committee's amendment thereto, was taken
                                up.
                            
                            Mr. HARRISON showed that the amendment was unnecessary. The bill, be
                                showed, simply set out and defined suck acts as shall be held as
                                "disturbance." The amendment was rejected; and then the bill was
                                considered as engrossed, read the third time, and passed the House
                                of Representatives--yeas 72, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            ANN VIZARD.
                            On the motion of Mr. BIRD (by consent) his bill, No. 71, for relief
                                of Ann Vizard, was taken up.
                            Mr. BECKETT recited the facts in the case. They were not as recited
                                in the bill. Some years ago he was employed to look after the
                                interests of a person that had purchased this land from the heir of
                                Mr. Curry. Curry left a cousin,, Mrs, Egan. Cousin sold it to
                                Haffren. Haffren conveyed it to Hedrick. Subsequently, Ann Vizard, a
                                niece of Curry, comes in and sets up the claim as heirship. False,
                                because she failed in the case prosecuted by her against Haffren,
                                while he owned the lands, to establish ber heirship. In that case it
                                was proved Egan was cousin, &c., though there was no judgment in
                                the case.
                            Mr. SHUEY. It was clear that there are heirs to this land, if it has
                                not escheated to the State.
                            Mr. COFFROTH presented one item. This same Curry (the deceased) is
                                said to have left an heir, Miss Aiken. But if, as it is alleged,
                                that this Miss Egan is an imposter, then this Mrs. Vizard is
                                acknowledged as of the blood of the deceased; is not to be estopped
                                by escheat Mrs. Vizard commences her suit, and she is turned out of
                                court because of alienage. It was to remove the difficulty as to
                                alienage that the bill was introduced.
                            Mr. BIRD explained facts connected with proceedings in the Select
                                Committee. Mrs. Vizard was a widow of a citizen of his county. it
                                would make no difference to the school fund whether the bill pass or
                                not. He hoped it would pass, so that Mrs. V. could go into the
                                courts and assert her legal right.
                            
                            The yeas and nays on the passage of the bill, resulted--yeas 34, nays
                                47.
                            So the bill was rejected.
                            Mr. OLLEMAN asked, ineffectually, for unanimous consent to take up
                                his bill, No. 123, to declare forfeit the right of way of certain
                                railroads.
                            On motion by Mr. DUNHAM, the Morgan raid bill, [S. No. 15 ] was taken
                                up and made the special order at 7 1/2 o'clock to-night.
                            On motion of Mr. DUNHAM, it was ordered, that when the House adjourn,
                                it shall be till 7 1/4 o'clock to-night.
                        
                        
                            LIMITATION.

                            

                            The SPEAKER now returned to the calender, and Mr. Miller of
                                Tippecanoe's bill, [H. R. No. 64,] to amend the 406th section, of
                                the Practice Act--[After five years, execution shall not issue upon
                                judgement without ten day's notice]--coming up--it was ordered to
                                the third reading, read the third time and passed the House of
                                Representatives--yeas 68, nays 6. 
                        
                        
                            ATTORNEYS.
                            Mr. Miller, of Clinton's bill, [H. R. No. 67,] to entitle attorneys
                                to hell liens on judgments--coming up--it was ordered to the third
                                reading, read the third time and passed the House--yeas 57, nays
                                12.
                        
                        
                            COUNTY MONUMENT BILL.
                            Mr. Gregory of Warren's soldiers' monument bill [H. R. 68--see page
                                86] was taken up, ordered to the third reading, read the third time
                                and passed-yeas 75, nays 0.
                        
                        
                            RAILROADS.
                            
                            
                            Mr. Groves' bill, No. 75, empowering railroads to build branches to
                                neighboring coal mines, coming up--it was ordered to the third
                                reading, read the third time and passed--yeas 71, nays 0. 
                        
                        
                            HON. N. G. SHAFFER.
                            Mr. MILROY asked for unanimous consent to move an allowance of $118
                                50 to Lucy Shaffer for the funeral expenses of her late husband,
                                Nelson G. Shaffer, deceased, late a member of this House.
                            Mr. STRINGER objected.
                        
                        
                            HIGHWAYS.
                            Mr. Stringer's Supervisor bill [H. R. 79-see page 103] coming up, it
                                was ordered to the third reading and read the third time. 
                            Mr. STRINGER asked to strike out so much of the bill as provides for
                                the assesment of a special tax on each acre of land. He believed it
                                was against the Constitution.
                            Mr. COFFROTH objected to striking out so as not to catch non-resident
                                land owners, He believed there was now such a law.
                            
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. It had been decided unconstitutional.
                             Mr. GRIFFITH desired to offer an amendment: All road work shall be
                                done between the first of May and the first of August, &c. 
                            Mr. STRINGER. The bill was from the first of May to the 15th of
                                August. 
                            Mr. GRIFFITH acquiesced, and withdrew his amendment.
                             Mr. STRINGER. It increases the tax--not less than 10 nor more than
                                25 cents. It allows $1 50 per day. It requires two to four days for
                                personal privileges. It secures the district tools for road
                                working.
                             Mr. STRINGER'S amendment was then adopted. So, the bill passed the
                                House--yeas 61, nays 7. 
                            On motion of Mr. WHITESIDE, The House took a recess till 7 1/2
                                o'clock P. M.
                        
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                         SPEAKER resumed at 7 1/4 o'clock P. M.

                        
                            GRANT COMMON PLEAS.
                            
                            Mr. JAMES asked and obtained leave te introduce a bill [H. R. 202] for an act to fix
                                the times of holding the Common Pleas Court in the County of Grant,
                                and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith:
                            Which was passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. JAMES and Mr. COFFROTH stated that there was a conflict as to the
                                time of holding the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts in Grant county.
                                They were both appointed to be held at the same time.
                            Mr. J. moved that it be declared expedient to suspend the
                                Constitutional restriction, for the purpose of reading the bill the
                                second and third times.
                            Mr. DUNHAM said his vote in the affirmative should not be taken as
                                acquiescing in the ruling, that two motions could be taken under a
                                single vote. 
                            The SPEAKER stated that though he had doubted, his mind was now free
                                from difficulty on the subject.
                            

                            The restriction was suspended-yeas 68, nays 0.The bill was then read
                                the second time by title, considered as engrossed, read the third
                                time and passed the House of Representatives-yeas 70, nays 0.

                            Mr. DUNHAM called for the special order, but yielded to--
                        
                        
                             RAILROAD CONSOLIDATION-CINNCINNATI AIRLINE.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE. He moved for and obtained unanimous consent to take up
                                the consideration of Mr. Church's railroad bill [H. R. No. 107 ]
                            Mr. LOCKHART proposed to amend, in section 2, by striking out the
                                words "or intersect."
                            It was adopted.
                            Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend the first section in the 12th line, by
                                adding: "until the annual election by the stockholders." And
                                striking out in the third line of the 4th section the words, "in
                                perpetuity."These amendments were severally adopted.
                            The bill was then read the third time.
                            Mr. WOODS. Did he understand that this bill gave power to every
                                railroad in the State to consolidate in one grand, great big
                                monopoly? [Laughter--'No, no.'] He wanted every railroad comply to
                                have a board of directors within this State.
                            Mr. WHITESIDE was frank to say that this bill was introduced to serve
                                the Cincinnati Air Line road. He responded to the objections of Mr.
                                Woods. Did not the gentleman hear the amendment offered by the
                                gentleman from DeKalb? He also was ia favor of every rail, road
                                coming into the State, having an office within this State. But
                                simply because this bill does not contain this provision, it was not
                                a consideration that should defeat it. The only new provision of law
                                in the bill, was, to admit railroads of the State to consolidate
                                with continuous lines running out of the State.
                            Mr. WRIGHT. While the Legislature holds the power to regulate the
                                tariff, there was nothing to apprehend from the power of
                                consolidation.
                            Mr. HENRICKS desired to offer amendments; but objection
                                prevented--the bill having been read the third time.
                            Mr. KILGORE said it was time that we should be cautious of what we do
                                in this direction. Twenty-five out of thirty of all the railroads in
                                the State had passed into the hands of capitalists outside of the
                                State. Resident stock holders will soon find that the controlling
                                power has passed away from them. He gave examples. He appealed to
                                gentlemen to protect the rights of citizens of Indiana. Already
                                legislation in this direction was much needed. Every railroad bill
                                of the session had been for extending the privileges of these
                                corporations. He accepted only Mr. Lockhart's bill.
                            Mr. COFFROTH spoke in favor of the bill. Its provisions were that the
                                company may fix the number of directors, because of the invalidity
                                of the clause in the general railroad law. Then if a director die
                                the county may fill the vacancy. And the other provision ot the bill
                                was that our railroads may consolidate with any railroad running
                                part in and part out of the State. These were the only features of
                                the bill which distinguish it from the general railroad law. The
                                bill makes almost every woodpile a station for shipping. And it
                                allows damages for depreciation in the value of freight while it may
                                be detained from shipment.
                            
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, demanded the previous question,and there
                                was a second, and under its pressure, the bill was rejected--yeas
                                22, nays 59.
                            Mr. HIGGINS made an ineffectual motion to take up the bill No. 27, to
                                legalize records.
                        
                        
                            MORGAN AND OTHER REBEL RAIDS.
                            Mr. DUNHAM now insisted on the special order, viz: the consideration
                                of the Morgan raid bill [S. No. 15--see page 34 ]
                            On motion by Mr. DUNHAM, (it being declared expedient to suspend the
                                constitutional provision for the purpose--yeas 67, nays 7,) the bill
                                was read the second time by title, [and by unanimous consent the
                                suspension was understood to carry the bill to its passage.]
                            Mr. DUNHAM had intended to answer Mr. Shuey's opposition to the bill.
                                But be would  not now take up
                                the time of the session. The bill, he thought, was carefully
                                prepared, am he supposed it could be passed without extended
                                discussion.
                            The committee had proposed to amend by striking out "one," and
                                inserting "three" commissioners.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK explained the amendments.
                            Mr. DUNHAM believed the amendments judicious; but considering the
                                lateness of the period of the session, perhaps it were better to
                                pass the bill without amendment.
                            Mr. COFFROFH moved to postpone the bill and make it the special order
                                for to-morrow morning 10 o'clock.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed an amendment which was read for
                                information:
                            Any citizen of Indiana, who has at any time aided the enemy, shall
                                not ba entitled to receive compensation for damages as provided in
                                this bill.
                            Mr. DUNKIRK. There was already a clause to that effect in the
                                bill.
                            The House refused to postpone.
                            Mr. DUNHAM said this amendment for to conventions had been distinctly
                                voted down in the Senate.
                            The amendment was adopted. The next amendment. The Commission shall
                                examine the claims of Railroad Companies, take the testimony and
                                report the same for the action of future legislation of the State or
                                of the future General Government, was adopted.
                            The further amendments, (merely verbal, were concurred in.
                            The last, amendment--to section 9--dividing the claims into classes,
                                as to injury done respectively by troops under order of State
                                officers, Federal officers, and rebels, being read--
                            Mr. BUSKIRK explained that he had copied this provision from the Ohio
                                legislation on this subject.
                            It was adopted.
                             The next amendment proposed to change the per diem of the
                                Commissioners from $8 to $6, being read--
                            Mr. THACHER ineffectually proposed $5.
                             The committee amendments were then adopted, and further literal
                                amendments re parted by the committee were concurred in.
                            Mr. BROWN earnestly desired the passage of the bill. But he did not
                                think it policy to press the final vote to-night.
                            Mr. PETTIT accepted the principle on which the bill is based--that
                                these losses shall be borne by all. But no improper burdens would be
                                thrown upon the State. He would avoid the aggregation of these
                                claims in the hands of assignees. To guard against this he proposed
                                an amendment to this effect:
                            It shall not be lawful for any person to receive any warrant for
                                allowance under this act until he shall have filed his affidavit to
                                the effect that he is the original claimant, and has not sold or
                                transferred the same to any person whatever, and does not intend to
                                do so; and any such transfer shall vitiate the claim.
                            He thought this a better provision than a mere naked prohibition,
                                without any penalty.
                             Mr. BROWN now suggested that the bill be read the third time and
                                then passed over.
                            Mr. PETTIT. Then, better not read it the third time.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK suggested whether there should not be some provision made
                                for those who have gone into the army and left a power of attorney
                                for others to look after the matter for them.
                            Mr. DUNHAM concurred in the amendment of the gentleman from Wabash,
                                [Mr. Pettit] and the suggestion of the gentleman from Monroe, [Mr
                                Buskirk.]
                            Mr. BUSKIRK stated the provision of the bill, which limits the
                                aggregate amount that shall be allowed by the Commissioners, to
                                $300. 
                            The subject was then made the special order for to-morrow morning at
                                9 1/2 o'clock.
                        
                        
                            STATUTES.
                            On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the House took up Mr. Gregory of Warren's
                                bill [H. R. 197] for the copyright of Gavin and Hord's Revised
                                Statutes of Indiana; and it was read the second time.
                            Mr. BRANHAM was opposed to the bill.
                            Mr. PETTIT put several interrogatories with reference to this
                                purchase. The naked copy right could do the State no good, unless we
                                go on and print the book.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Why should the bill prohibit the printer
                                from selling the book for less than $2.
                            Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said he had suggested the purchase; but the
                                bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee. Its
                                object was economical. He would be willing to lay it over till to
                                morrow.
                            Mr. GLAZEBROOK moved ineffectually for indefinite postponement.
                            It was then postponed till to-morrow at 11 o'clock A M. 
                        
                        
                            THE BRIGHT LANDS.
                            On motion of Mr. JOHNSON, his bill [H. R. No. 78] for the sale of the
                                State lands in the counties of Jasper and Newton at public outcry,
                                provided said lands shall not be sold for less than $1,50 per acre
                                the first time they are offered for sale, and providing for right of
                                pre-emption at the same price. Lands unsold one year from the time
                                they shall be first offered maybe sold for one dollar an acre.

                        PERSONAL.
                        Messrs. BENNETT, BRADLEY and PEDEN, noticing in these Reports that they
                            were recorded as absent on last Monday evening, explained the reason of

                        Mr. HORD stood opposed to the bill. He could not vote for it in its
                            present shape, and cited cases where the bill would prove a damage to
                            the State if it were allowed to pass.
                        Mr. BENNETT could not see the force of the objections urged against the
                            bill, and hoped it would pass.
                        Mr. OYLER also favored the passage of the bill.
                        The bill was then passed the Senate by yeas 32, nays 14-as follows:

                        SALARY OF JUDGES.
                        On motion by Mr. BONHAM, the bill S.
                                126 (page 138) was read the second time.
                        Mr. VAN BUSKIRK made an ineffectual motion to amend--yeas 13, nays 31--by
                            increasing the salary of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
                            $2,000.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by increasing the salaries of Common Pleas
                            Judges to $1,250.
                        Mr. RICHMOND moved to amend the amendment by substituting $1 500.
                        Mr. WRIGHT moved to lay both amendments on the table.
                        Mr. WILLIAMS demanding a division of the question--

                        
                        The Senate refused to lay the amendment to the amendment on the table by
                            yeas 21, nays 26.
                        Mr. BROWN of Wells favored the substitution of $1,500 as the salary of
                            the Common Pleas Judge.
                        Mr. CULLEN regarded the amendment as right and just, and hoped it would
                            be adopted.
                        Mr. HORD had been striving to crush out the Common Pleas Courts, but as
                            the Senate has decided otherwise for the present, he was in favor of
                            sustaining the dignity of that Court, and should vote for the
                            amendment.
                        Mr. WRIGHT opposed this increase of salaries to lawyers.
                        
                        The question recurring on the motion to lay the amendment (Mr. Williams')
                            on the table--it was agreed to by yeas 37, nays 15.
                        The amendment, (Mr. Richmond's) was then agreed to by yeas 29, nays 17,

                                        Gifford, Hyatt, Jenkins, Mason, Milligan, Moore, Oyler,
                                        Terry, Vawter, Williams and Wnght--17.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the amendment was agreed to.
                        Mr. OYLER moved to amend by making the salary of the President of the
                            Sinking Fund $2,000.
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 34,
                            nays 13.
                        On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the salary of the Superintendent of Public
                            Instruction was fixed in the bill at $1 500.
                        Mr. COBB moved to further amend the bill so as to make the salaries of
                            Supreme Judges $3,000.
                        Mr. PEDEN understood the Judges now pass upon all cases in full bench,
                            which requires the presence of Judges here nearly all the time, and from
                            that one fact alone, their expenses will be much more than formerly.
                            Hence he thought the proposition to be eminently just.
                        Mr. CORBIN thought the Judiciary should have an ample salary, and was
                            satisfied the present salaries of the Supreme Bench were not
                            sufficient.
                        Mr. CULLEN. There is nothing that gives more character to a State than
                            the management of the Supreme Court. The motion out to prevail, for the
                            present salaries of Supreme Judges are a disgrace to the State. No other
                            State in the Union pays these officers so small a salary.
                        Mr. CASON. You make the compensation sufficient, and all the judges will
                            examine every case of importance. The present compensation compelled the
                            judges to divide out, the cases and make the decisions the individual
                            option of one of the judges--the others severally concurring.
                        Mr. BROWN, of Wells, thought three thousand dollars was small
                            compensation for these men at the present prices. The amendment was then
                            agreed to by yeas 36, nays 16--as follows:

                                        Hamilton, Brown of Wells, Cason, Chapman, Cobb, Corbin,
                                        Cullen, Davis, Douglas, Downey, Dunning, Dykes, Gaff, Hanna,
                                        Hord, Marshall, Milligan, Newlin, Peden, Richmond, Thompson,
                                        Van Buskirk, Ward, Woods and Wright--3O.
                                    NAYS--Messrs. Barker. Bowman, Bradley, Culver, English,

                                        Staggs, Terry, Vawter, and Williams--22.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. CORBIN moved to amend by making the salary of the Warden of the State
                            Prison $2 000.
                        On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 37,
                            nays 3.
                        Mr. OYLER understood the bill as making the salary of Common Pleas Judges
                            a tax on the State Treasury, and although he would like to vote for the
                            increase to the Supreme Judges, he was compelled to vote against the
                            bill.
                        On motion by Mr. COBB, the constitutional provision was suspended, and
                            the bill read a third time and passed by yeas 30, nays 17.
                        On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the vote just taken was reconsidered.
                        Mr. BENNETT obtained unanimous consent to strike out from the bill all
                            that applies to the Adjutant General and Quartermaster General.
                        
                        The bill was again put upon its passage, and failed for want of a
                            constitutional majority--yeas 21, nays 10.
                        Mr. CASON demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered, when--
                        The Senate took a recess till 2 o'clock.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                         The Lieutenant Governor being absent, the Principal Secretary called the
                            Senate to order.
                         On motion by Mr. VAWTER, Mr. Dunning took the chair.
                        Mr. OYLER demanded a call of the Senate.
                        It was ordered, and sixteen Senators failed to answer.
                         On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the absentees were sent for.

                            Mr. VAWTER, from the select committee thereon, submitted a report
                                returning the bill  H. R. 58,
                                with amendments equivalent to a new bill on the subject,
                                recommending passage. 
                            The report was concurred in. 
                        
                        
                            ADJUTANT GENERAL.
                            Mr. BENNETT, from the Committee on Military
                                    Affairs, presented a report on the condition of the
                                Adjutant General's office exactly similar to the one presented to
                                the House of Representatives last Thursday, and described on page
                                304 of the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.

                             On motion by Mr. OYLER, the bill, S. 64, (see page 63) was read the
                                second time and ordered to be engrossed for the third reading. 
                        
                        
                            SALARIES OF JUDGES.
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT farther proceeding under the call were
                                dispensed with.
                            Mr. CASON obtained unanimous consent to amend the bill, by providing
                                that the salaries of Common Pleas Judges shall be paid in the manner
                                now provided by law.
                            The bill, S. 136, (see page 138) was then passed the Senate by yeas

                                    S. 178. (see page 283,) was read the third time and

                                    H. R. 140, (see page 169.) was read the second time, and
                                under a suspension of the rules, was read the third time and passed
                                by yeas 44, nays 2.

                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to take up the bill H. R. 59, (see page 83.)
                            Mr. BENNETT demanded a call of the Senate. It was ordered and every
                                Senator answered to his name except one [Mr. McClurg,] who had leave
                                of absence.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to amend the motion by substituting the bill H. R.
                                153, (see page 179,) legalizing the acts of Governor Morton
                                concerning the President's advance of $250,000.
                            
                            Mr. Cobb made an ineffectual motion--yeas 20, nays 27--to lay the
                                amendment on the table.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS then asked for a decision on the point of order he
                                raised just previous to the adjournment of last evening.
                            Mr. OYLER argued to show that the point of order amounted to
                                nothing.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS sustained his point of order in a few remarks.
                            Mr. BENNETT contended that in absence of a rule on this question the
                                Senate can make a rule for itself at any time.
                            Mr. CULLEN was of the opinion that the point of order cannot be
                                raised now under rule No. 30 of the Senate.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS, for the purpose of saving time, withdrew his point of
                                order.
                            Mr. CORBIN inquired why legislation of this kind is thrust into our
                                face in advance of the in any important measures now before the
                                Senate.
                            Mr. CULLEN demanded a call of the Senate.
                            It was ordered, and two Senators were reported absent without
                                leave.
                            On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the absentees were sent for.

                            Mr. BENNETT offered the following :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That a committee of three
                                            Senators be appointed to inquire into and report to the
                                            Senate the amount of stationery drawn by the committees
                                            and officers of the Senate, specifying the committees
                                            and officers, and the amount so drawn by each.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the resolution was amended by providing
                                that the elective officers report the number, names, and employment
                                of their appointees.
                            The resolution, as amended, was adopted.
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR subsequently made the committee to consist of
                                Messrs. Dunning, Cason and Downey. 
                        
                        
                             THE LENGTH OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS offered the following :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved by the Senate, (the House
                                            concurring therein,) That the Constitution gives power
                                            to the General Assembly to pass bills until Saturday
                                            night the 4th inst.
                                    
                                
                            
                            On motion of Mr. CASON the resolution was referred to the
                                    Judiciary Committee with instructions to
                                report thereon as soon as possible.
                        
                        
                            THE PRESIDENT'S ADVANCE OF $250.000.
                            The further call of the Senate was dispensed with.
                            
                            The Senate agreed to the amendment, (Mr. Bennett's,) proposing to
                                take up the bill H. R. 153--by yeas 27, nays 19. 
                            
                            The bill again failed to pass for want of a constitutional majority
                                --yeas 25, nays 24--the same vote as yesterday afternoon.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to take up the Whitewater Valley Canal
                                bill, [H.R. [59]  [H.R. 59,]
                                and demanded the previous question thereon but there was no
                                second.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT--yeas 27, nays 22--the motion was laid on
                                the table.
                        
                        
                            ORDERS OF THE DAY.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved that the Senate proceed to the orders of the
                                day.
                            
                             Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion--yeas 17, nays 32--to lay this
                                motion on the table.
                            
                            The motion to take up the orders of the day was agreed to by yeas 31,
                                nays 18.
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK the Senate proceeded to consider bills
                                on the third reading. 
                        
                        
                            CLERKS AND SHERIFFS.
                             The bill S. 24. (see page 38,) was read the third time and laid on
                                the table. 
                        
                        
                            AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.
                            
                            


                            The bill S. 119 (see page 138)
                                was read the third time and passed by yeas 45, nays 0.

                        
                        
                             THE LENGTH OF THE SESSION.
                            Mr. BENNETT moved to take up the message just received from the
                                Governor--the same as the one printed in the House proceedings of
                                this day--it having been presented to that body first.
                            
                            Mr. COBB made an ineffectual motion-yeas 23, nays 26--to lay this
                                motion on the table.
                            
                            The Senate then agreed to the motion to consider the message by yeas
                                33, nays 14.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the message was referred to the judiciary
                                committee by yeas 41, nays 5.
                        
                        
                            SALARIES OF JUDGES.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells--yeas 35, nays 13--this House
                                amendment to the bill S. 326, (see page 138) was taken up. 
                            The amendment was concurred in. 
                        
                        
                            SESSION HOURS.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. VAWTER the vote adopting the order for a night
                                session was reconsidered upon a division--affirmative 27, negative
                                not counted.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BENNETT the resolution was amended by changing the
                                hour, from. 7 1/2 o'clock P.M., to 9 o'clock to-morrow-
                                morning--yeas 42, nays 4.
                            The resolution as amended was adopted.
                        
                        
                            STATUTES FOR SENATORS.
                            Mr. MOORE, from the Committee on Claims, reported
                                in favor of the account of David Stevenson for 50 setts of Gavin and
                                Hord's statutes for Senators, $500.
                            Mr. NOYES, as one member of theCommittee on
                                Claims, announced that he dissented from this report.
                            The report was concurred in.
                            And then the Senate adjourned.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                        FRIDAY, March 3, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 8 o'clock A. M. and directed the reading of the
                        journal of yesterday.
                    On motion of Mr. BROWN the further reading of the journal was dispensed
                        with.
                    Mr. BROWN asked but could not obtain leave to introduce a resolution for the
                            per diem of Mr. Lee, Representative from Washington
                        County,--he having been detained at home a few weeks of the former part of
                        the session, by an injury from a horse.
                    Mr. BOYD from the Committee on Claims, returned sundry
                        allowed claims ; and the $5,000 claim of Edwin May, for services as
                        Architect of Northern Prison--withdrawn at the request of said May.
                    Mr. SULLIVAN of Posey and Vanderburgh, from the Committee on Rights
                            and Privileges, returned the petition of the Friends Yearly
                        Meeting against the 13th article of the State Constitution, &c.,
                        recommending that it lie on the table.
                    Mr. BURNES from the same Committee, submitted a minority report, reasoning
                        for the repeal of the 13th article of the Constitution, and for a revision
                        of the school laws, in that regard. 
                    
                        COSTS OF ELECTION CONTESTS.
                        Mr. KILGORE, from the Committee on Elections, reported
                            resolutions to allow the four parties to the Putnam contest $50 each for
                            Attorneys' fees, and to allow then all jointly $163.15, the amount of
                            certified costs in the case.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN demanded the yeas and nays thereon, resulting--yeas 27, nays
                            51: so the resolutions- were rejected.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, voted in the negative for the purpose of moving a
                            reconsideration, which he did. He said his own seat had been contested,
                            and the contest was pursued with a pertinacity worthy of a better cause.
                            A member's pay was $183. His actual expenses in that contest had been
                            $120.00, and if that were not allowed to him, a simple calculation would
                            show the amount of his per diem left.
                        Mr. SHUEY hoped the vote just taken would be reversed, for the precedent,
                            if nothing else. Such a precedent as this vote would make, would reader
                            impossible for a poor man to make a contest for a seat here. He
                            submitted other considerations.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion to reconsider on
                            the table Affirmative 22, negative 51.The question then recurred on the
                            motion to reconsider. 
                        Mr. LOCKHART thought it not right to pay the expenses of these contests.
                            He gave the case of the contest of the seat of Senator Dickinson from
                            his county.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN submitted that Lane and Hamrick, from Putnam, and Miller, from
                            Clinton, had asserted their claims, and the contests had exhibited
                            plausible cases. The Senate had allowed these expenses both at the
                            present and former cessions.
                        Mr. KILGORE set forth the facts belonging to the case, and reasoned for
                            the propriety of making the allowance. The consequence of refusing these
                            expenses would be to discourage contests where there is fraud. If we do
                            not make these allowances, more than half these fraudulent cases would
                            go without contest, and men would occupy seats here to which they would
                            have no right.
                        Mr. OLLEMAN. Adopt this policy and it would encourage frivolous contents
                            like that which came from Clinton county.
                        Mr. BROWN. Was it right that Mr. Miller should bear his part of the
                            expenses of a contest which he did not provoke?
                         Mr. OLLEMAN replied.
                        Mr. CHURCH. It had cost him $150 to prevent frauds in
                            his election. He attended to these matters that might come up in contest
                                before the election, and his expenses therein were
                            $150. If his place had been contested his people would have borne the
                            expense.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK interposing, said we had already expended more in debate than
                            the money involved in these resolutions, besides putting aside important
                            business.
                        Mr. CHURCH replied, deprecating lengthy "constitutional'' speeches, and
                            insisting that these expenses ought to be paid by the people and parties
                            at home. He referred to the refusal of members to vote money for more
                            reasonable claims.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, proposed to amend by adding the cost of the
                            gentleman's whiskey bill on the Dog law.
                        Mr. CHURCH showed that the House made unjust discriminations, and
                            withdrew his opposition.
                        Mr. KILGORE said the parties were willing to amend the resolution so as
                            to strike out the Attorneys' fees.
                        Mr. LANE. If it is not proper and customary and right we did not want it.
                            He would be satisfied either way,
                        Mr. GLAZEBROOK said, Attorneys generally encouraged these contests; and
                            as the lawyers generally encouraged contests, he was like the Dutchman
                            that, when he found which way the lawyers were going, he "turns his pack
                            and goes shust de oder way." [Laughter.]
                        Mr. DUNHAM. As this matter seems to protract itself, he demanded the
                            special order.
                        The SPEAKER. The motion to reconsider has precedence.
                        Mr. DUNHAM, then demanded the previous question; and there was a
                            second.
                        
                        The yeas and nays, haying been ordered, were taken, resulting yeas 29,
                            nays 47: so the House refused to reconsider.
                        Mr. BROWN submitted that the other report from the Committee on
                                Elections that with reference to the expenses of the
                            Clinton contest--should be now made.
                        It was then submitted by Mr. KILGORE allowing by resolution to Hamilton
                            and Miller each $100 for their costs in said contest. He demanded the
                            previous question.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH would strike from the resolution the name of Thomas M.
                            Hamilton.
                        Mr. CHURCH called for a division of the question.
                        The SPEAKER ruled that the question is not susceptible of division.
                        There was a second for the previous question, and the main question was
                            ordered.
                        
                        The yeas and nays resulted yeas 25, nays 49: so the resolution was
                            rejected.
                    
                    
                        CALVIN F. ROOKER.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved to suspend the special order and take up the Specific
                            Appropriation bill.
                        Mr. BRANHAM desired the House first to determine whether it was intended
                            by the resolution in his hand, to pay Calvin. F. Rooker (an ordnance
                            officer) $2 a day,, who had been already fully paid.
                        Mr. SHUEY moved to reconsider the vote adopting said resolution.
                        Mr. BROWN moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK bore testimony to the efficiency of this officer
                            [Rooker.]
                        Mr. BRANHAM. Rooker was a clerk, employed at $90 a month; and the
                            officers of the department, say it is enough.
                        Mr. LOCKHART should vote no more money in this direction,
                        Mr. GRIFFITH said that $5 a day was little enough for the compensation of
                            a clerk.
                        
                        Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question on the motion to reconsider;
                            and, under its pressure the vote was reconsidered--yeas 54, nays 28.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the resolution be laid on the table; and then, on
                            his further motion, this subject was laid aside for the consideration
                            of--
                    
                    
                        THE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATION BILL.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK (the constitutional restriction having been
                            suspended for the purpose--yeas 81, nays 0) the bill No. 200 was read
                            the second time by title.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend by adding a section, allowing to Holloway,
                            Douglass & Co. the sum of $375 for extra copies of the Indianapolis
                            Daily Journal furnished to members of the House and charged to their
                            stationery account.
                        Several members stated that they had  paid their accounts with that Company for the Journal.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB explained, that these papers were ordered through the
                            stationery clerk.
                        The SPEAKER explained.
                        Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend the resolution by making it an inquiry of
                            the Committee, and to extend the inquiry to the extra copies of
                            newspapers furnished by the proprietors of the Daily State Sentinel.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, and Mr. BUSKIRK. It was simply carrying out
                            the action of the House in. the matter. It was too late to inquire into
                            its wisdom.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB accepted the modification.
                        Mr. HIGGINS saw no necessity for this resolution.
                        Mr. COFFROTH asked and obtained leave to have referred with the
                            resolution the accounts with the State Sentinel as to the matter of
                            newspapers just handed to him by the Stationery Clerk.
                        The subject was accordingly referred.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Clinton, submitted a resolution reciting the allowance by
                            the Report of the State Prison north, of the claim of D. J. Silver for
                            extra-lawful interest, and directing the Committee on Ways and
                                Means to incorporate the same ($1500) in the specific
                            appropriation bill.
                        Mr. GROVES. Was it the determination to pay men who took a contract
                            knowing that there was no appropriation, not even for lawful
                            interest--to say nothing about damages? These parties looked this thing
                            in the face, and made their contracts accordingly.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB read section 24, article 4 of the Constitution, to the point
                            that it was utterly incompetent for the Legislature to pass a law
                            allowing damages.
                        Mr. BROWN. It was not a proposition to pay damages but a clear and just
                            claim. He referred to the valuable public results from these contracts
                            in the construction of the Northern Prison; and reasoned therefrom for
                            the adoption of the amendment.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. The Committee unanimously reported in favor of paying
                            Silver's damages. Silver borrowed money at 12 per cent, interest. He
                            paid between $3,500 and $4,000, and after putting in the 6 per cent,
                            interest there was no other way than to put in this $1500 damages.
                        Mr. HENRICKS. This damages should go to the parties holding this scrip
                            for the $27,000 that the State should have paid two years ago. Upon what
                            data does the gentleman figure up the damage?
                        Mr. GRIFFITH. Upon the fact that the money was due and unpaid.
                        Mr. KILGORE had known Mr. Silver for the last ten years. He knew this
                            fact, that during the last two years Mr. Silver had been embarrassed.
                            His losses had been four times this allowance. What scrip he did retain
                            has been pledged for loans at 12 per cent. If there ever was a just
                            claim before a legislative body, this was one.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. If he had the power to sue the State he could recover but
                            six per cent. We had some two or three millions of State bonds lying
                            useless in the drawers and safes of our creditors. We voted nothing as
                            damages to Winslow, Lanier & Co. But gentlemen could not get over
                            the constitutional restriction he had read.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The same question was staring the gentleman in the face when
                            he voted for the Winslow & Lanier matter.
                        He demanded the previous question, and there was a second.
                        
                        And under the force thereof the instructions to the Committee were
                            rejected-- yeas 36, nays 45.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, called for the orders of the day.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK called for the special order, viz: the consideration of the
                            Senate Morgan raid bill. No. 15.
                        Mr. BRANHAM desired to suspend the special order for the consideration
                            and engrossment of the general appropriation bill.
                    
                    
                        GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to dispense with the special order and take up the
                            general appropriation bill.
                        The motion was agreed to; and the amendments thereto, reported from the
                                Committee on Ways and Means, were severally read,
                            considered and agreed to.
                        On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. Montgomery obtained leave of
                            absence--indefinite-- sickness in his family.
                        Mr. MEREDITH proposed to add $10.-000, so as to make $60,000 for each of
                            the two years for the Blind Asylum expenses; which was agreed to.
                        Mr. HOWARD proposed to add a clause for $6,000 for the purchase by the
                            Directors of the Southern Prison of six acres or land owned by Joseph D.
                            Smith,immediately south of said prison, provided it shall not cost more
                            than $1,000 an acre.
                        Mr. HOWARD and Mr. BUSKIRK showed that this ground was essential to the
                            Prison, and that it would be economy for the State to purchase it
                            now.
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        The bill was then ordered to the engrossment and third reading.
                         Mr. GREGORY of Warren, (by consent) submitted an order making the Senate
                            bill (No. 190--described on page 328 of these Reports,) prescribing the
                            order of business for the consideration of matter going over from the
                            present to the extra session of the General Assembly, if an extra
                            session should be called by the Governor, special order for to-morrow
                            morning.
                        
                        The order was adopted.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH submitted a resolution (which was read) allowing to each of
                            the four parties to the Putnam county contests--Messrs. Puett, Colover,
                            Lane and Hamrick,--the sum of $75 each, toward expenses by them incurred
                            in said contests. 
                        Mr. CHURCH objected.
                        The bill for general appropriations was then read the third line by the
                            clerk.
                        Mr. HIGGINS submitted the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the Stationery Clerk be
                                        instructed to report to the House a detailed statement of
                                        the Stationery furnished to the different committees of the
                                        House.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted.
                        On motion by Mr. GROVES, the House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        
                        The CLERK called the House to order at 2 o'clock P. M., and Mr. Henricks
                            was called to the Chair.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER stated the consideration of unfinished business,
                            viz: the final passage of the general appropriation bill [H. R. No. 176.]
                        Mr. ZEIGLER and Mr. OLLEMAN obtained leave of absence after to-day--on
                            account of sickness.
                        

                        The general appropriation bill was passed the House of
                            Representatives--yeas 74, nays 0. 


                        
                            MORGAN RAID BILL.
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER now returned to the special order, viz : the
                                consideration of the Morgan and other rebel raids bill [S. 15.]
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. submitted an amendment to this effect: Strike out all
                                after the word "state" in section 5 ; and add a provision for the
                                appointment of a clerk for said Commission at $5 a day.
                            The latter clause of section 5, he said, makes it the duty of the
                                Attorney to discharge the duty of clerk. The two positions were
                                incompatible. The amendment was to strike out that portion of
                                section 5 which authorizes the Attorney to act as clerk ; and to
                                authorize the appointment of a clerk, Mr. B. gave way, and
                            Mr. PETTIT renewed his amendment offered yesterday. His first
                                proposition being to strike out the last proviso to section 1, and
                                at the end of section 13, insert to this effect:
                            It shall not be allowed to any person to receive anything under this
                                act, till he or his Attorney shall have first filed with the Auditor
                                of State his affidavit, which shall be dated not more than ten days
                                before the issuing of the warrant, that he is the original claimant,
                                and that since the passage of this act, he has not sold or
                                transferred the same to any person whatever, or agreed or stipulated
                                for the same : and any such transfer shall vitiate the allowance;
                                and it may be recovered back, &c.
                            The amendment was adopted.
                             Mr. BUSKIRK'S amendment was then adopted.
                            
                            Mr. BUSKIRK made an ineffectual motion to make the compensation of
                                the Attorney for the commission $6 a day, instead of $5--affirmative
                                26, negative not counted.
                            Mr. BRANHAM. Was there any provision for raising the money to pay
                                these claims ? There would be no more money in the Treasury than
                                would be necessary to carry an the State Government.
                            Mr. WRIGHT proposed to publish the notice of the sessions of the
                                commission in some newspaper in each county named in the bill.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB submitted a new section to this effect :
                            That, if the payments to be made by the State under the provision of
                                this act shall leave a deficit in the Treasury, it shall be the duty
                                of the Governor, Auditor and Treasurer, or of a majority of them, to
                                borrow so much money as may be necessary to make such payments, for
                                which they shall give the obligation of the State payable not later
                                than the 4th of March, 1867, with interest at six per cent.
                            It was adopted.
                            
                            The bill was then passed the House--yeas 56, nays 26.
                            Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to confirm this action, by
                                motions to reconsider, and lay the motion to reconsider on the
                                table.
                            So the bill passed with an amendment of title, viz : "And to
                                authorize the Governor and Auditor and Treasurer of State to
                                contract a debt for the purpose of reimbursing the Treasury of the
                                State for the amount hereby disbursed."
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, made an ineffectual motion to take up the
                                Agricultural College bill, No. 6.
                        
                        
                            EXTRA SESSION BILL.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, [the bill [S. No. 190] providing for the completion of the
                                unfinished business of any regular or special session of the General
                                Assembly at the next special session ot the same General Assembly,
                                was taken up and passed to the second reading.
                            On his further motion, (the constitutional restriction having been
                                suspended for this purpose,) the bill was ordered to the second
                                reading, and read the second time by title.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB moved that it be read the third time now.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK hoped the gentleman would admit of another suspension to
                                remove all constitutional doubt about the validity of the
                                proceeding.
                            

                            Mr. NEWCOMB acquiesced. It was easier to suspend than to debate. And
                                then on his further motion, the constitutional restriction was again
                                suspended--yeas 62. nays 14,--and the bill was read the third time
                                and passed--yeas 63, nays 16.

                        
                        
                            NORMAL SCHOOL.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. RHOADS, the Normal School bill  [No. 119] was taken up.
                            
                             Mr. OLLEMAM desired an amendment so that the Board of Trustees of
                                the School shall be elected by a concurrent vote of the two Houses
                                of the General Assembly.
                            It was taken by unanimous consent.
                            Mr. HAMRICK submitted an amendment, in the 11th section striking out
                                so as to place all students of the institution on an equality,--with
                                no charge for tuition : which was taken by unanimous consent.
                            

                            The bill was then passed the House--yeas 58. nays 20.

                        

                        
                            SALARIES OF THE JUDGES, &C.
                            

                            On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the order of business was suspended, and
                                the bill  [S. 126] to amend
                                section 1 of the act relative to the salaries of public officers,
                                &c., was taken up, and passed to the second reading.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. The only purpose of the bill was to increase the
                                salaries of the Supreme, Circuit and Common Pleas Judges. He moved
                                to suspend the constitutional restriction and read the bill the
                                second time now.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, moved to amend the motion so that the
                                suspension shall admit also of the third reading.
                            The amended motion was agreed to--yeas 64, nays 11--and the bill was
                                read the second time.
                            Mr. LANE proposed to amend the bill by striking out "$1300'' and
                                inserting in lieu thereof "$1600" for the Superintendent of Public
                                Instruction.
                            Mr. HIGGINS proposed to reduce the allowance of salary to the Supreme
                                Court Judges from $3000 to $2500 and make the salaries of the
                                Circuit Court Judges $1750 ; and the salaries of the Common Pleas
                                Judges $1250.
                            Mr. PETTIT gave considerations in favor of the provisions of the
                                original bill. He would bring to an end this law of unrequited
                                service, so far as the Judiciary is concerned.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH commended the remarks of the gentleman from Wabash, [Mr.
                                Pettit.] He would not have the judges seeking out of the way places
                                for cheap living. And he trusted that while gentlemen might be ready
                                to requite the services of the Judiciary, they would not, at the
                                proper time, forget themselves.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe, the amendment was laid on the
                                table--yeas 61. nays 28.
                            Mr. OLLEMAN moved to reduce the salary of the President of the
                                Sinking Fund Commissioners from three thousand dollars to two
                                thousand dollars.
                            On motion by Mr. BROWN, it was laid on the table.
                            On motion by Mr. PETTIT there was added a section to the bill,
                                declaring that the provisions of this act shall not affect any other
                                than the salaries of the Judges and the Superintendent of Public
                                Instruction.
                            The final vote on this bill resulted--yeas 51, nays 24 : so the bill
                                passed the House of Representatives.
                            Mr. BRANHAM asked, but did not obtain leave to report the specific
                                appropriation bill from the Committee on Ways and
                                    Means. 
                        
                        
                            THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
                            
                            On the motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the bill [S. No. 20.] to amend sections
                                1 and 2 of the act fixing the per diem and mileage
                                of the members of the General Assembly. &c., approved June 4,
                                1852, was taken up and read the second time.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to strike out "five" and insert "three dollars
                                for every twenty-five miles travel."
                            Mr. BROWN desired that the gentleman would withdraw the amendment. It
                                could not pass the Senate if amended here.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. There was inequality.
                            Mr. KILGORE. How much mileage did the gentleman from Marion receive
                                ?
                            Mr. NEWCOMB did not live one mile from the State House.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH concurred with Mr. Newcomb in the matter of mileage. He
                                would stand by the bill; but feared, if the amendment is not made it
                                would be lost.
                            Mr. MILROY demanded the previous question, and there was a second,
                                and the main question was ordered.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered.
                            The vote resulted--yeas 37, nays 44.
                            So the amendment was rejected.
                            The bill was then ordered to the third reading.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH moved to suspend again the constitutional restriction,
                                to admit of a motion that the bill be put on its passage now.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, said he had moved to suspend the
                                restriction for the second and third readings.
                            But to assure the House against error in the clerk's notes
                            

                            On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, the restriction was again suspended--yeas
                                63, nays 13--and then the bill was again ordered to the third
                                reading, read the third time and passed the House--yeas 53, nays
                                28.

                            On motion of Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, a night session for to-night
                                was ordered. 
                        
                        
                            DEARBORN COMMON PLEAS.
                            

                            
                            On the motion of Mr. GREGG the bill 
                                    [S. 195,] to legalize and declare valid the proceedings of
                                the Common Pleas Court of Dearborn county for February, 1865, was
                                taken up and ordered to the third reading, read the third time and
                                passed--yeas 70, nays 3.

                        
                        
                        
                            SPECIFIC BILL.
                            Mr. BRANHAM, (by unanimous consent ) now reported back the specific
                                appropriation bill [H. R. No. 200.] with amendments thereto,
                                numbered from 101 to 143 both inclusive.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to amend by inserting the amount of the claim
                                of Dr. Woodburn, $800 for expenses incurred by him for the benefit
                                of the Hospital for the Insane. The Commissioners have expressed the
                                opinion that this claim ought to he allowed.
                            Mr. BRANHAM explained how this Superintendent draws $600 salary. This
                                was a claim for pay for the gentleman's acquisition of professional
                                skill. How much would each member here have to expend, in order to
                                qualify himself for his public duties?
                            On motion by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, it was laid on the table. 
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to allow Messrs. Lane and Hamrick $75 each for
                                expenses incurred in contesting their seats.
                            It was rejected.
                            Mr. GRIFFITH proposed to pay each of the members of the Prison
                                Committee $15 for expenses incurred in visiting the Prisons.
                            Mr. WRIGHT proposed to amend, by allowing members of these
                                committee's mileage.
                            Mr. LOCKHART spoke against the amendment.
                            Mr. MILROY. This was the first time that the House had refused to pay
                                the expenses of these committees. Gentlemen traveling were at
                                expenses of eating and sleeping.
                            Mr. HIGGINS had understood that the Senate had allowed mileage to
                                their committees, and he moved to amend the amendment, by allowing
                                mileage to the members of these committees.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE DAYS.
                            
                            

                            The following message from the Governor was received and read by the
                                hand of an Executive Messenger :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            To the House of Representatives of the
                                                State of Indiana:
                                        
                                        The Constitution of the State limits the legislative term
                                            to sixty-one days. In counting these days, heretofore,
                                            Sundays have been included. I am satisfied, however,
                                            from a careful examination of the Constitution, in
                                            connection with several usages and principles of law
                                            that are well recognized, that the practice has been
                                            erroneous, and that sixty-one working day are meant. By
                                            common consent in this and other States, Sunday is not
                                            considered a legislative day, and it is specially
                                            excepted from the three days during which the Governor
                                            has time to consider a bill. In analogy to this, Sunday
                                            is not considered as a judicial day to be counted in the
                                            term of court in any State where the common law
                                            prevails.
                                        It will not be denied by any one that the legislative
                                            term established by the Constitution, as heretofore
                                            construed, is too short for the dispatch of the
                                            necessary business of the State, and if, by proper
                                            construction, it can be extended for a few day , will be
                                            of great importance to the public interest
                                        Accordingly, I have asked the opinion of the four Judges
                                            of the Supreme Court upon the questions which they have
                                            given to me in writing as follows:
                                    
                                
                            



                            
                                
                                    
                                        INDIANAPOLIS, March 8,1865. 
                                        
                                            To His Excellency O. P. Morion,
                                                Governor:
                                        
                                        Sir, in response to your request for our opinion upon the
                                            question whether "the term of sixty-one days") to which
                                            the session of the Legislature is limited by the
                                            Constitution, includes intervening Sundays, we beg to
                                            say that we have given the subject such consideration as
                                            time would permit, and that we deem the better opinion
                                            to be that business days only are embraced. Various
                                            considerations tend so strongly to support this view
                                            that if a contrary practice had not heretofore
                                            prevailed, we would hardly entertain a doubt upon the
                                            subject.
                                        If the Legislature should now be of the opinion above
                                            indicated, and should act upon it, of course it, would
                                            go far to annul the influence of the former practice of
                                            that body as a precedent, and at any rate if the
                                            question be deemed a doubtful one, the courts would not,
                                            it is well settled, be justified in holding void the
                                            action of a co-ordinate department.
                                        This being simply question of public importance which
                                            cannot, as we suppose, involve any party considerations,
                                            or mere private and personal interests, we have felt no
                                            delicacy in giving our view upon it. We have not meant,
                                            however, to depart from that rule of silence which we
                                            have prescribed to ourselves, as to measures of
                                            legislation which may be pending.
                                        
                                             CHAS. A. RAY,
                                             J. T. ELLIOTT,
                                             JAS. S. FRAZER,
                                             R. C. GREGORY.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                                
                                    
                                        I have also consulted the President of the Senate, and
                                            the Speaker of the House of Representatives, both able
                                            and learned lawyers, and find that they concur in the
                                            opinion expressed by the Judges of the Supreme
                                            Court.
                                        In view of the importance of the subject, and the present
                                            condition of the business of the Legislature, I have
                                            thought it proper to call your attention to the subject
                                            in a special message.
                                        
                                            O. P. MORTON,
                                             Governor of Indiana.
                                        
                                    
                                
                            
                            On the motion of Mr. COFFROTH, (by unanimous consent,) the foregoing
                                message was taken up, and read by the clerk.
                            Mr. COFFROTH, regarding the communication of such a character as to
                                demand the immediate attention of the House, moved that it be
                                referred to a special committee of five members.
                            Mr. DUNHAM regarded it as an impudent and impertinent interference on
                                the part of the Executive in the proper business of a co-ordinate
                                branch of the government, and proposed to amend the motion to refer,
                                by substituting an order, that the message be respectfully returned
                                to His Excellency, with the information that this House is
                                abundantly able to interpret the Constitution, and to determine for
                                itself what shall be its action undor that instrument. It was an
                                impudent interference with the legislative authority, the
                                legislative powers and duties of the House of Representatives. It
                                was an attempt at interference by the Executive, such as he
                                undertook to say, was never before heard or read of in the
                                legislation of any State of this Union or in the Congress of the
                                United States. He was quite certain that in the Congress of the
                                United States, made up as it was with the political partizans of Mr.
                                Lincoln, such a message would not be tolerated, for a single  moment. To receive such a
                                message here would be to give up at once the dignity that belongs to
                                a legislative body. When we come in here and take upon ourselves the
                                oath to support the Constitution, as representatives of the people,
                                what was it but a solemn legal announcement of the right and duty of
                                interpreting that Constitution for ourselves. To receive this
                                message would be to accept the Governor as the Executive of our
                                action. But the terms of the Constitution makes him the Executive of
                                the State--simply the Executive of the edicts of the people of the
                                State made through their representatives in this body. And if there
                                is a single line in that instrument that makes the Governor or the
                                Judges of the Supreme Court to stand for us as interpreters of the
                                Constitution for the direction of our duty, he had never yet been
                                able to comprehend it. The powers of this government are three: the
                                Legislative is first, because it comes directly from the fountain
                                and source of all government--the people. The next is the Judiciary,
                                whose duty it is to interpret nothing but the action of the
                                Legislative power. And then comes the Executive power, which is to
                                execute what the legislative power have passed upon, and that which
                                the Judiciary have declared. Such was the duty of the Governor, and
                                he has no duty beyond that. And he repeated the declaration, that
                                there was neither power in the Constitution nor precedent in
                                legislation for such a communication as this addressed by the
                                Executive to the legislative branch of the government: and there
                                cannot be found one scintilla of authority in the Constitution that
                                gives right or permission to the Governor to come in here with any
                                such address as this to the Representatives of the people of the
                                State, and undertake to tell them what are their legislative rights,
                                powers and duties: And for one, he undertook to say, at the
                                threshhold, that he would resist it--not by physical force--but he
                                would resist it to the utmost of all the political power he
                                possessed. He declared this night, that he would not stand for one
                                single hour under the dictation of His Excellency,neither enquiring
                                after other men's views, nor earing what anybody else might do or
                                say, for he believed that in thus deprecating and denying this
                                attempted interference of the Executive he announced the rights and
                                liberties of the people, and but asserted the dignity of a
                                representative of the people. In doing this, he believed that lie
                                was trying at least to bring back and reassert that sovereign power
                                which was stealing away from the American people, and which must be
                                recovered or free government is gone. There was nothing in which he
                                could engage with more earnestness than in the work of resisting the
                                interventions of the Executive in any matter which lies wholly with
                                the people and their representatives. These were inalienable rights,
                                and he would guard them jealously, and allow not the first symptom
                                of interference: and for one--come weal or woe--he would stand by
                                them and defend them to the utmost of his power.
                            Mr. KILGORE interposing. How was this message an interference with
                                the Legislative power ?
                            Mr. DUNHAM. It was an interference simply because the. Constitution
                                never contemplated that the Executive should attempt to interpret
                                the Constitution for us, and define our duty : simply, because each
                                one of us is supposed to have and to exercise the same power of
                                reasoning and common judgment with His Excellency, and the same
                                right to interpret the Constitution. For we are all required to cake
                                the same oath that he has taken : and it is not his right to come in
                                here in the way of interference in our prerogatives. He did not say
                                that this was the exercise of any power, but he characterized it as
                                an interference with the right and the dignity of the House of
                                Representatives.
                            Mr. SIM (interposing.) Had not the Governor a right to advise with
                                the General Assembly ? There was nothing like dictation in it.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. It was the right of the Governor to suggest such matter
                                of legislation as his judgment shall approve as conducive of the
                                interests of the people: but this is a matter of conscience of legal
                                interpretation for our legislative action and guidance, not
                                contemplated in the Constitution.
                            Mr. KILGORE. Did he understand the gentleman to say that the Governor
                                has no right to call the attention of the House to this matter ?
                            Mr. DUNHAM. The Governor had no right to address the House except to
                                call its attention to matter of legislative action.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. That was what he supposed the Governor desired in this
                                message. He did not regard it as in any sense a dictation on the
                                part of the Governor ; but it was simply calling our alteration to
                                the fact, that there is a contrariety of views on the question
                                whether Sunday is a legislative day--giving his own views and those
                                of the Supreme Court Judges and others. He did think, on the first
                                blush, and he still thought the ruling was wrong and it was for that
                                purpose--to investigate the matter--that he had moved to refer it.
                                He did not regard the message as in any sense offensive, or in the
                                spirit of dictation.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. As it appeared to him, there was nothing
                                in this message either unusual, or inconsistent with the duty of the
                                Executive, nor anything that could be considered otherwise  than as a suggestion for the
                                public good. He hoped it would be referred.
                            Mr. REESE moved to refer the message to the Committee on the
                                    Judiciary.
                            Here there was a demand and second of the previous question, and
                                under its force Mr. Reese's motion was rejected.
                            And then the message was referred to a select committee of five.
                                Whereupon--
                            The SPEAKER announced the following gentlemen as members of said
                                committee ; viz : Messrs. Coffroth, Church, Newcomb, Buskirk and
                                Miller of Tippecanoe.
                            Mr. COFFROTH moved to reconsider the vote whereby the night session
                                was ordered ; which was agreed to.
                            And then the order was rejected.
                            On motion by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, the bill S. 168 fixing the times of
                                holding courts in the Third Judicial Circuit was taken up and read
                                the second time.
                            On motion by Mr. OSBORN the bill S. 173 to enable boards of trustees
                                of incorporated towns to authorize persons to enclose fronts for
                                shade trees and ornamental purposes, was taken, up and read the
                                second time.
                             And then at 6:10 P. M., the House adjourned till to-morrow morning
                                at 9 'o'clock.
                        
                    

                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1865.
                    
                    The Senate met at 9 o'clock. A. M.
                     On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the reading of yesterday's journal was
                        dispensed with.
                    
                        THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM.
                        
                        
                        On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the constitutional provision was twice
                            suspended--yeas 31, nays 9--and the bill H. R .178 (see pages 136, 137,
                            138, 113 and 313 of the BREVIER REPORTS,) was read the first and second
                            times by title only.
                        On motion of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, the Senate resolved itself into a committee
                            of the whole, Mr. Van Buskirk being called to the chair--and proceeded
                            to the consideration of the bill H. R. 178.
                        Mr. NILES advocated the increased rate of taxation for the support of
                            common schools. The bill under consideration had been prepared with the
                            concurrence of the former and present Superintendents of common schools,
                            and of the committees on education of both Houses. It is our highest
                            duty as legislators to provide for the education of the children of the
                            State. The bill makes a small increase of revenue for the purpose, and
                            though he would cheerfully vote for twenty cents on the hundred dollars,
                            the rate agreed upon by the House is the best we can hope to obtain at
                            the present session. He was aware that taxes for bounties and other
                            purposes are to be very heavy, but nobody complains of the school tax.
                            He hoped the bill would be passed without amendment.
                        Mr. CARSON moved to amend the bill by fixing the tax at 10 cents instead
                            of 16 cents on the $100.
                        Mr. DOUGLAS would prefer twenty cents, and offered an amendment to the
                            amendment to that effect, but immediately withdrew it at the request of
                            several Senators.
                        Mr. TERRY was also in favor of twenty cents.
                        On motion by Mr. CULLEN, the amendment was laid on the table.
                        Mr. HORD moved to strike out that portion of the bill which provides that
                            the fund shall not be diminished by the expenses of its collection. He
                            thought this Legislature was strangling the energies of the people by
                            imposing upon them so much additional taxation.
                        
                        On motion of Mr. ALLISON, the amendment was laid on the table, upon a
                            division--affirmative 28, negative not counted.
                        Mr. COBB was satisfied this bill was an improvement on the old law, and
                            although he could not endorse everything in it, still, with its defects,
                            he hoped it would pass without amendment. Any amendment would certainly
                            defeat the bill.
                        Before the bill was half read--
                        On motion by Mr. DOWNEY, the committee rose, reported progress, and asked
                            to be discharged from the further consideration of the bill.
                    
                    
                        RAILROAD TAXATION
                        On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, it was
                        
                            
                                
                                     Resolved, That the House of
                                        Representatives be requested to return to the Senate House
                                        Bill No. 158, which was transmitted to the House, as having
                                        passed the Senate, by mistake.
                                
                            
                        
                        On motion by Mr. CASON, the rules were suspended for the third time
                            to-day, and the bill H. R. 178
                            (see 135 and subsequent pages,) was ordered to be read the third
                            time.
                        Pending the reading thereof came the recess for dinner.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The third reading of the common school bill H. R. 178 was resumed and
                            concluded.
                        On the demand of Mr. VAN BUSKIRK, a call of the senate was had, which
                            discovered the fact that 12 senators were absent.
                        On his further motion the absentees were sent for.
                        When the absent senators appeared, further proceedings under the call
                            were dispensed with.
                        Leave of absence was granted to Mr. Fuller.
                        Mr. CARSON moved to recommit the bill to a special committee of one from
                            each congressional district, with instructions to amend by striking out
                            of section one the words "sixteen cents," and inserting in lieu thereof
                            the words "ten cents." 
                        
                        
                        On motion of Mr. RICHMOND the motion to recommit was laid on the table by
                            yeas 31, nays 11.
                        Mr. CULLEN moved to recommit the bill with instructions to incorporate
                            therein the following :
                        SEC. That teachers in the common schools of this state shall teach the
                            principles of the national and state governments, so far as the same may
                            be practicable, and shall inculcate in the minds of the people, the love
                            of country.
                        On motion by Mr. MASON, the motion to recommit was laid on the table.

                        
                            DRAINING CALUMET RIVER VALLEY.
                            The judiciary committee returned the bill H. R.
                                55, (see page 83) with amendments recommending its passage.
                        
                        
                            SINKING FUND COMMISSIONERS.
                            The committee on finance returned the bill H. R.
                                47, (see page 73,) increasing the powers of sinking fund
                                commissioners, &c., with amendments., recommending its
                                passage.
                        
                        
                             THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM.
                            >The question being, shall the bill--H. R. 178-pass?
                            Mr. HORD spoke of the general and particular objections to the way
                                this long hill of one hundred and ninety-nine sections had been
                                pushed through the Senate. He could not say that he was prepared to
                                vote for the bill, for it was certainly too onerous a burden to
                                place upon our already overtaxed and overburdened people.
                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK replied to the objection's urged and endeavored to
                                convince gentlemen that they were not well founded.
                            Mr. CULLEN much regretted the fact that this bill came in at so late
                                a day in the session. While he had the utmost confidence in the
                                ability of the committee reporting it, yet he could not consent to
                                the passage of the bill without presenting his objections to the
                                Senate. He objected particularly to that part of section
                                twenty-live, which confers upon the trustee the power of making
                                repairs upon, or of removing or erecting school houses. The people
                                of the district have the right to direct as to these things, and no
                                man should disregard that right. He also protested against the
                                passage of the bill without the amendment which he had the honor to
                                offer a short time since, but which the Senate saw fit to lay on the
                                table. Notwithstanding his objections, however, he should vote for
                                the bill, relying upon the record of the Senate proceedings to show
                                his position more clearly than him vote would.

                            On motion by Mr. NILES, the House amendments to the bill S. 6, (see page 63) were taken
                                up. 
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to concur with an amendment striking out the
                                prohibition so far as it relates to recorder.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BENNETT, the amendment was laid on the table, by
                                yeas 26, nays 17.
                            Mr. WILLIAMS moved to indefinitely postpone the bill.

                            On motion by Mr. MARSHALL the bill
                                    H. R. 202 was read the first time--the second and third
                                times under a dispensation of the constitutional provision, and
                                passed by yeas 46, nays 0.

                        
                        
                            APPROPRIATIONS FOR 1865 AND 1866.
                            Mr. CHAPMAN moved to take up the general appropriation bill H. R. 176.
                            Mr. HORD moved to amend by taking up the White Water Valley Canal
                                bill H. R. 59.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND moved to lay the amendment on the table. His motion was
                                agreed to by yeas 28, nays 19.
                            Mr. VAWTER moved to amend by substituting the Morgan raid bill, S.
                                15.
                            
                             On motion by Mr. CULLEN this amendment was laid on the table--yeas
                                29, nays 18.
                            
                            Mr. HORD made an ineffectual motion to lay on the table the original
                                motion (Mr. Chapman's,)--yeas 18, nays 29.
                            Mr. CASON demanded the previous question. It was seconded by 26
                                Senators.
                            
                            Mr. HANNA made an ineffectual motion--yeas 16, nays 39--to
                                adjourn.
                            
                            The main question was ordered by yeas 33, nays 13.
                            
                            The main question being on the motion (Mr. Chapman's) it was agreed
                                to upon a division--affirmative 29, negative not counted.
                            The general appropriation bill, H. R. 176 was read the first
                                time.
                            
                            Mr. CHAPMAN made an ineffectual motion--yeas 30, nays 16--to suspend
                                the constitutional provision and read the bill the second time
                                now.
                            On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the bill was read by title only, and
                                referred to the committee on finance.
                            
                            That committee then had leave of absence for consultation.
                        
                        
                             THE MORGAN RAID BILL.
                             Mr. COBB moved to take up the Morgan raid bill, S. 15.
                             Mr. ENGLISH appealed to Senators to take up this bill and let the
                                House amendments be concurred in.
                            Mr. BENNETT opposed the motion.
                            On motion of Mr. CULLEN the Senate took a recess till 7 1/2 P. M.
                        
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                         The Senate met at 7 1/2 o'clock P. M.

                        
                            RIGHT TO PROLONG THE SESSION.
                            Mr. NILES, as chairman of the judiciary committee by unanimous
                                consent, said that the committee in obedience to the resolution of
                                the Senate had under consideration the message of the Governor, as
                                to the right to continue the session after Monday. The committee
                                were in session again last night till near midnight without being
                                able to arrive at an unanimous conclusion. In a matter of such grave
                                importance it was desirable, if possible, that unanimity be secured.
                                The committee hoped to be ready to report on Monday morning, which
                                would be in time for all practical purposes.
                            He remarked that in his opinion, the words of the constitution fixing
                                the term of the session might reasonably be construed to mean
                                working days. In counting the mere lapse of time, for example the
                                days which a bill of exchange has to run, we reckon by revolutions
                                of the earth upon its axis. But since the sixth century of the
                                Christian era in counting working days, such as days for judicial
                                and legislative purposes, Sunday has been considered a dies non as completely as if Saturday night lapped
                                directly on to Monday morning.
                            That usage was brought to this country with the common law, as part
                                of our civilization. In the absence of any contemporaneous
                                construction to the contrary, weekdays alone would be included in
                                the sixty-one days ; but it was only fair to say that, according to
                                his recollection of the proceedings in the convention, sixty days
                                was first proposed for the duration of the session, but afterwards a
                                revisory committee changed it to sixty-one days, as he supposed, in
                                order that the session might terminate on Monday, instead of
                                Sunday.
                            The question, in his mind, was chiefly one of expediency, as to
                                whether it is wise now to depart from what seems to be a settled
                                usage, for a temporary benefit, however great, or whether it is
                                better to apply the old maxim stare decisis.
                        
                        
                             CLAIMS.
                            The committee reported favorably to Mr. H. Good's for $9 and $12, and
                                adversely on Werden & Co.'s for $40.19 
                        
                        
                            THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE.
                            Mr. BROWN of Wells. (Mr. Dunning in the chair) offered the following
                                :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the thanks of the Senate
                                            be and they are hereby tendered to the Hon. Conrad
                                            Baker, lieutenant governor, for the able and impartial
                                            manner in which he has, during the present session,
                                            discharged his duties to the Senate as its presiding
                                            officer.
                                    
                                
                            
                            The resolution was adopted by a standing vote.
                        
                        
                            THE SINKING FUND.
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK the bill H. R. 199, providing for the
                                distribution of the interest from loans of the sinking fund, was
                                read the first time and the second time, under a dispensation.
                            Without objection the bill was amended by striking out the word
                                "fond," and in lieu thereof inserting the word "revenue." 
                            On motion by Mr. VAN BUSKIRK the constitutional provision was again
                                dispensed with, and the bill read the third time and passed by yeas
                                21, nays 18.
                            On motion by Mr. DUNNING the vote on the passage of the bill was
                                reconsidered, and--
                            After some conversation across the hall. cad in order to save
                                time--
                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK withdrew his motion to read the bill a third time
                                now.

                            On motion by Mr. HANNA, the bill H.R. 122, (see page 158) was read the third time under a
                                dispensation of the constitutional provision, and finally passed by
                                yeas 46, nays 0. 

                        
                        
                            INDIANA REPORTS.
                            On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the House amendment to the bill, S. 101, (see page 125)
                                striking out the copy right, was concurred in. 
                        
                        
                            THE MORGAN RAID.
                            Mr. COBB withdrew his motion, made just before the recess for supper,
                                to take up the Morgan and other rebel raids bill, S.15.

                            The committee on financereturned the general
                                appropriation bill.  H. R.
                                    176 with amendments, recommending its passage.
                            Messrs. BENNETT, DUNNING and COBB expressed the opinion that the bill
                                had better be passed without amendments for fear it might not find a
                                quorum in the House to pass the Senate amendments ; and Messrs.
                                BEESON, CHAPMAN and CULLEN assigned similar reasons for the votes
                                they cast upon the passage of the bill.
                            
                            On motion of Mr. BENNETT the committees' amendments were laid on the
                                table by yeas 36, nays 9.
                            On further motion of Mr. BENNETT the constitutional restriction was
                                suspended and the bill read the second time.
                            

                            Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to further suspend the constitutional rule and
                                read the bill the third time now.
                            Leave being granted Mr. BROWN, of Wells, offered the following :
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the previous order of
                                            business be suspended and that the following bills be
                                            taken up in the order named and brought to a direct
                                            vote, namely: The Morgan Raid bill, White Water Railroad
                                            bill, the Morton bill, the appropriation bill, and that
                                            by the adoption of this resolution, Senators pledge
                                            themselves to carry out the order named.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. CORBIN then addressed the Senate at some length reviewing the
                                action thereof for the past few days. During his remarks several
                                Senators grew impatient and points of order were raised that he was
                                not confining himself to the question before the Senate.
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR finally decided that the points of order were
                                well taken.
                            Mr. CORBIN appealed from the decision of the Chair and demanded the
                                yeas and nays on the question of appeal.
                            
                            The question being : "Shall the decision of the Chair stand on the
                                judgment of the House?" it was decided in the affirmative by yeas
                                36, nays 3.
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, withdrew his resolution.
                            Mr. ALLISON demanded the previous question and there being a second
                                the main question was ordered.
                            
                            The constitutional provision was then suspended and the bill passed
                                by yeas 42, nays 3.
                            Pending the roll call--
                            Mr. BROWN, of Wells, said he voted for the bill under protest. He
                                would not like to see it fail for want of his vote.
                            Mr. CARSON rather than see the measure defeated would vote
                                ''aye.''
                            Mr. DOUGLAS saw many things in the bill he did not like, but
                                preferred to vote for this one rather than the House should adjourn
                                without passing any general appropriation bill.
                            Mr. DOWNEY had not obtained his own consent to act upon a measure of
                                so much importance, it having been before the Senate but so short a
                                time, and requested that his name, should be passed till he saw the
                                result of the vote.
                            Mr. VAWTER voted under an arrangement with gentlemen that other bills
                                now before the Senate should be acted upon to-night.

                            And so the bill passed. 

                        
                        
                            WHITE WATER VALLEY CANAL.
                            Mr. ENGLISH moved to take up the Morgan and other rebel raids bill S.
                                15.
                            Mr. COBB moved to amend by substituting the White Water Valley Canal
                                bill H. R. 59.
                            
                            Mr. CULLEN made an ineffectual motion--yeas, 22 ; nays 25--to lay the
                                amendment on the table. 
                            Mr. GIFFORD demanded the previous question, and the demand was
                                seconded by twenty-seven senators.
                            
                            The main question was ordered by yeas 30, nays 16, and the amendment
                                agreed to by yeas 30, nays 15.
                            
                            The original motion as amended was also agreed to by yeas 31 nays
                                15.
                            The question then being on the passage of the bill H. R. 59--
                            Mr. COBB demanded the previous question and there was a second.
                            
                            Mr. CULLEN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 8, nays
                                36.
                            The main question was ordered by yeas 33. nays 10.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 8, nays
                                37.
                            Mr. CORBIN moved to reconsider the vote ordering the main
                                question.
                            
                            On motion by Mr. VAWTER the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                table--yeas 35, nays 11.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 8, nays
                                39.
                            
                            The first part of Mr. Cullen's amendment to section 1, (see page 348
                                of these Reports.) was read and rejected by yeas 12, nays 34.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 8, nays
                                37.
                            
                            The second part of the amendment just described was read and rejected
                                by yeas 12, nays 34.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn;yeas 9, nays
                                33.
                            The amendment offered by Mr. Oyler (see page 348) was read and
                                rejected by yeas 12, nays 35.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 12, nays
                                34.
                            Mr. BENNETT, in pursuance of an understanding had at the time the
                                other amendments were offered, submitted the following :
                            Amend by adding to the first section the following; And
                                    provided further, That the grantee, or lessee of any canal
                                granted or leased under the provisions of this act, shall construct,
                                and put in working order, a railroad along the line of such canal,
                                as above provided, within three years from the date of such grant,
                                or lease, or on failure so to do, forfeit all the rights and
                                privileges so granted.
                            
                            The amendment was rejected by yeas 12, nays 32.
                            
                            Mr. OYLER made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 15, nays
                                30.
                            Pending the roll call--
                            Messrs. CARSON and DOWNEY announced as an explanation of their votes
                                that it was after the hour of twelve, midnight.
                            Mr. OYLER, as he was a conscientious man and didn't like to work on
                                Sunday asked to be excused.
                            So the Senate refused to adjourn.
                            The bill H. R. 59 was ordered to be read, the third time now by yeas
                                28, nays 7--5 refusing to vote.
                            
                            Pending the roll call--
                            Mr. CORBIN as it was past midnight objected to casting any more votes
                                and asked that his objection might be spread upon the journals.
                                [Voices- "I object."]
                            Mr. CULLEN said this being the Sabbath day. I refuse to vote.
                            Mr. OYLER said this being the Sabbath day I decline to vote, and ask
                                that it may go upon the journals.
                            So the Senate refused to adjourn.
                            
                            Mr. RICHMOND made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 13, nays 24. 
                            Mr. RICHMOND moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
                                ordered to be read the third time.
                            On motion by Mr. DUNNING the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                                table by yeas 25, nays 74 refusing to vote. 
                            On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS it was
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That when the Senate
                                            adjourns, it adjourns to meet on Monday morning at 9
                                            o'clock.
                                    
                                
                            
                            
                            Mr. WILLIAMS made an ineffectual demand for the previous
                                question--but 23 Senators seconding the demand.
                            
                            Mr. CULLEN made an ineffectual motion to adjourn--yeas 12, nays
                                21--refusing to vote 2.
                            
                            Mr. CULLEN made an ineffectual demand for a call of the Senate--yeas
                                3, nays 25--refusing to vote 4.
                            There being no quorum present--
                            The Senate adjourned at twenty-five minutes before one o'clock a.
                                m.
                        
                    
                
                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         SATURDAY, March 4, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 9 o'clock a. m., directing the roll-call to
                        determine a quorum.
                    Mr. BECKETT moved that the reading of the journal of yesterday be dispensed
                        with.
                    Mr. DUNHAM and Mr. COFFROTH objected and demanded the yeas and nays on the
                        question of dispensation.
                    The vote resulted--yeas 46, nays 34: So the reading of the journal was
                        dispensed with, and it was approved without reading.
                    
                        THE RIGHT OF PROTEST.
                        Mr. BROWN rose to a privilege question. He had understood that the
                            protest of a number of members preserved last Monday, was not entered
                            upon the journal. He now asked, as a matter of right, that it be ordered
                            to be spread upon the journal.
                        The SPEAKER said the motion was not in order when petitions are called
                            for. Then the question as to what is a protest, is for the determination
                            of the House ; and it is subject, to the order of the House, whether it
                            shall go on the journal or not. It is not a matter of discretion with
                            the clerk.
                         Mr. COFFROTH moved to suspend the order of business, in order to admit
                            of a motion to spread the protest on the journal. He had not much
                            experience in legislation: but, as he understood it, a protest went upon
                            the journal as a matter of course. And he was surprised, that the Chair
                            should direct that it should not be spread upon the journal.
                        The SPEAKER. No motion is in order whilst the Chair is executing a
                            standing rule of the House, which is the presentation of petitions.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB suggested, that a committee be appointed, and that that paper
                            be referred to it, with instructions to inquire and report whether it is
                            a protest or not.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. We will not consent to anything of the kind. I appeal from
                            the decision of the Chair. I appeal from the decision of the Chair to
                            the judgment of the House. 
                        Mr. BROWN rose to a privilege question. He submitted that, under the
                            constitutional provision, which he read, any member has the right to
                            have his reasons for the protest spread out the journal, and that when
                            the protest is presented, it goes on the journal as a matter of
                            right.
                        The SPEAKER. Whether it is a protest or not, lies with the House to
                            decide. Neither motion nor debate thereon is in order.
                        Mr. DUNHAM said that would take away the right of members.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair begs to be relieved from all controversy with the
                            gentleman from Floyd [Mr. Dunham,] at this time, and while he occupies
                            this position of Speaker.
                        Mr. DUNHAM still remonstrated--standing in his place.
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Floyd will take his seat.
                        Mr. DUNHAM continued without regard to direction of the Chair and
                            demonstrations with the hammer.
                        The SPEAKER. The proper officers will cake charge of the gentleman from
                            Floyd.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Having said what he intended, he would now take his seat.
                        Some confusion followed--one of the assistant doorkeepers executing the
                            order of the Chair, was directed by Mr. Dunham to get away from him, as
                            it appeared, Mr. D. made some demonstration with his hand.-- Members
                            rose in different parts and many called to order. Order being
                            restored--
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman rose to a question of privilege which the
                            Chair overruled ; the gentleman from Jackson rose also to another
                            question of privilege, which the Chair could not determine: the matter
                            was stated--and both being overruled, the interruption by the gentleman
                            from Floyd had prevented the Chair from entertaining the question of
                            appeal. The gentleman from Huntington will now send up his appeal in
                            writing. Nothing can be  in order
                            now till the question of appeal shall be settled.
                        Mr. COFFROTH submitted the following.
                        
                        "From the decision of the Chair, ruling out of order the motion of the
                            gentleman from Huntington and Whitley to suspend the order of business
                            to enable him to move that the protest of certain members of this House
                            be spread upon the journal, we appeal." (Signed)J. R. COFFROTH,J. B.
                            BROWN, and others. 
                        Mr. COFFROTH. The House usually suspended business for the purpose of
                            deciding these questions.
                        Mr. BUSKlRK. If the Chair held, that the motion to spread the matter upon
                            the journal is not in order till we reach the order for resolutions and
                            motions, he thought that was correct. It would not be in order to make
                            that motion without a suspension of the order of business. He knew no
                            rule, nor did it occur to him that there was any reason why the order of
                            the presentation of petitions might not be suspended as well as any
                            other order of business.
                        The SPEAKER. The Chair will remark from the gentleman from Huntington
                            [Mr. Coffroth.] in regard to the general ruling of the Chair. The
                            reading of the journal of yesterday was dispensed with. There is a
                            standing rule of the House, which requires that after the reading of the
                            journal petitions shall be presented. When petitions are presented
                            nothing else can be done. So also when committees are reporting nothing
                            but reports can be heard. But when we reach joint resolutions, bills and
                            motions then it is in order to make motions in reference to taking up
                            business of any kind. This is the principle upon which the Chair has
                            uniformly ruled, on both sides, without being actuated by any partizan
                            feeling.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK did not see why a motion to suspend the rules was not in
                            order.
                        The SPEAKER, For the reason that no motion is in order when petitions and
                            reports are in order. The Chair had called for petitions when the
                            gentleman rose and asked for a suspension.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. It was before petitions were called if I mistake not.
                        The SPEAKER. It was after petitions were called.
                        
                        Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on the appeal, and
                            the decision of the Chair was sustained by the judgment of the
                            House--yeas 44, nays 33,
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren explaining, said that, at the proper time he was
                            willing to vote that the protest go upon the journal, but at this time
                            he voted to sustain the decision of the Chair.
                        So the decision was sustained.
                    
                    
                        REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the Committee on
                                Education, returned a Wayne county petition for the German
                            Language in the Common Schools, reporting that the same is not
                            practicable.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the Committee on Claims, returned
                            and reported the allowance of sundry claims.
                        Mr. BONNER, from the Committee on the Sinking Fund,
                            returned the claim of John T. Smith, recommending that it be laid on the
                            table.
                        Mr. COOK, from the Committee on Rights and Privileges,
                            returned Mr. Woods partition fence bill No. 29, recommending that it be
                            indefinitely postponed.
                        Mr.STENGER, from same committee returned Mr. Miller of Canton's fee bill,
                            No. 56, recommending that it be laid on the table.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK from the Joint Committee on Corporations,
                            returned sundry bills for amendment of the general corporation acts,
                            reporting that the Senate bill on that subject now pending in the House,
                            will, in the opinion of the Committee remedy all defects in the City
                            Charters.
                        Mr. HENRICKS, from the special committee on Mr. Reese's Railroad bill No.
                            30, returned the same with an amendment, striking out all after the
                            enacting clause, and inserting new matter.
                    
                    
                        THE PROTEST.
                        Mr. BROWN now submitted again the minority protest which was presented by
                            Mr. Coffroth last Monday, (see pages 331 and 332 of these Reports.) and
                            asked that it be entered on the journal of the House.
                        The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman want it read ?
                        Mr. BROWN. No sir.
                        Mr. HIGGINS. If it were not objectionable in character, and if it
                            correctly stated the facts, he would not object to its going on the
                            journal. But if, as he had understood, there was a paragraph on the
                            first page of the protest, impugning the motives and the action of the
                            majority, he should object. 
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, hoped it would be allowed to go on the
                            journal. The report of a committee could settle any question is to the
                            facts.
                        Mr. BOYD said, he regarded it as no protest--as nothing but a stump
                            speech. If gentlemen would bring up something in the shape of a protest
                            against any action of the House he could not object, but he did object
                            to recording this protest against no action of the House.
                        Mr. BROWN. The parties signing it were the exclusive judges whether it is
                            a protest or not. It protests against a certain action, and then gives
                            the reasons for it. It was taken up, endorsed and filed as a protest,
                            notwithstanding the opinion of the learned gentlemen from Lawrence. He
                            would say to that gentleman that the minority here have the power--not
                            to say the muscular, physical power--but the political, power to assert
                            the right of deter-  [deter]mining
                            whether this is a protest or not. The gentleman from Tippecanoe was
                            right --instead of denying the right of protest to meet protest by
                            protest. It was a thing unknown to parliamentary law, for the Majority
                            to assume to deny that such a paper is a protest. This was a clear right
                            which the constitution secures to every lumber of the House : and for
                            the exercise of it, he would not ask the permission of any gentleman,
                            party friend or not. Be submitted that a protest goes on the journal
                            without the action of the House ; and if the learned Speaker should rule
                            otherwise--and doubtless he would--be would appeal from the decision to
                            the judgment of the House. It was a right which has never been
                            questioned in all the long years of legislation at this capita--secured
                            by the traditions of the past and by the constitution of the State--to
                            have our protest written on the journal, whether we are right or wrong
                            in presenting it.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB moved to amend the motion, by adding: That the protest, when
                            to entered on the journal, shall be referred to a committee to report
                            whether it is a protest or not. He supposed gentlemen on the other side
                            could have no objection to that.
                        Mr. BROWN. If the constitution is right, he submitted that the other
                            party have no right to interfere,--but to oppose protest to protest.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, demanded the previous question ; and there was a
                            second. And then the protest was ordered to the journal and referred to
                            a select committee of five.
                    
                    
                        CYRUS L. DUNHAM.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB submitted the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Whereas, Cyrus L. Dunham, a member of the
                                        House, did on this day arise in his place and proceed to
                                        discuss a question which the Speaker decided was not
                                        debateable; and Whereas, said Dunham, after the ruling of
                                        the Speaker, did contumaciously proceed in his remarks, and
                                        in consequence thereof was ordered by the Speaker to take
                                        his seat; which said Dunham refused to do : whereupon the
                                        Speaker directed that the proper officers of the House
                                        should enforce the order so made by the Speaker; and
                                        whereas, Wm. W. Browning, an Assistant Doorkeeper of this
                                        House, in obedience to the mandate of the Speaker,
                                        approached to the said Dunham to perform the duty imposed
                                        upon him by the said order of the Speaker; and whereas said
                                        Dunham did violently strike said Browning in the presence of
                                        and within the Bar of the House, while the latter was in the
                                        discharge of his duty under the direction of the Speaker:
                                        therefore--
                                    Be it resolved, That, for the offense
                                        aforesaid, the said Cyrus L. Dunham be and he is hereby
                                        expelled from this House. 
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. DUNHAM had but one thing to say ; and that is, that, in the preamble
                            to the resolution, there is a mistake as to the facts. Before the
                            Doorkeeper approached me, or spoke to me--as all, I think, will bear
                            testimony around me--I was in the act of taking my seat,, I was part way
                            down when He put his hand on my shoulder. It was clearly, Mr. Speaker,
                            an attempt to arrest me when I was obeying orders. It was for that
                            reason I told him to go away from me.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, stated his observation of the matter, The
                            gentleman from Floyd said he would set down, but in obedience to the
                            order of the Speaker. I think also that the Doorkeeper came to the
                            center of the aisle and waited there, till I thought he was not going to
                            obey the order of the Chair. The gentleman from Floyd was in the act of
                            setting down, but I doubt whether the Doorkeeper understood it or not.
                            The action of the Doorkeeper was mild and forebearing. It was not done
                            as though he would commit any violence upon the gentleman from
                            Floyd.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Was it not a just inference for me to draw, that the
                            Doorkeeper, when he saw I was in the act of sitting down, wanted to make
                            a show of authority?
                        The SPEAKER directed the clerk to read a report from the
                                Committee on Enrolled Bills, and the announcement
                            that he had signed sundry bills.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB, At the time of the acts named in the resolution there was a
                            good deal of excitement in the House, and he believed that some degree
                            of that excitement remains yet. Gentlemen had come to him declaring that
                            if such conduct was tolerated they would abandon this Legislature. For
                            this reason be did not want to consider this resolution further now, and
                            moved that it be made the special order for 2 o'clock.
                        Messrs, COFFROTH, BROWN, DUNHAM and others objected.
                        Mr. ABBETT. Was it in order to move an amendment to the motion?
                        The SPEAKER. Yes.
                        Mr. ABBETT would move then that the resolution be made the special order
                            for Monday two weeks.
                        VOICES. "Object," "Object."
                        
                        Messrs. COFFROTH and BROWN demanded the yeas and nays. The special order
                            was made according to Mr. Newcomb's motion--yeas 45, nays 27.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Does the Chair decide that it is competent for a majority
                            to make a special order? He understood that this motion was an
                            equivalent to the suspension of the order of business.
                        The SPEAKER. The gentleman well understands that the order of business
                            had not been called for, and that at this time it is competent for any
                            gentleman to offer a resolution, and it may be adopted by a majority
                            vote.
                        Mr. COFFROTH. Is it competent for a majority to make a special order?
                        Mr. SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it is, and has never ruled otherwise.
                    
                    
                         MR. LEE'S PER DIEM.
                         Mr. BROWN submitted a resolution for an order for the allowance of per
                            diem to  Jamison Lee,
                            Representative from Washington county, for the entire term of the
                            session. He stated again the circumstances under which Mr. Lee was
                            detained at home, and the fact that the Speaker had advised Mr. Lee that
                            he could not issue his warrant for per diem before the
                            time he was sworn in.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. That was the same resolution offered yesterday morning to
                            which he objected. He did so because, before the gentleman came here he
                            had heard that he declared he was not corning to sit In this House with
                            a d--d abolition Legislature. But from conversation with Mr. Lee since,
                            he was satisfied that if any such remark was made it was in a jocular
                            way. He was not influenced by partisan bias, wished to do justice to Mr.
                            Lee, and withdrew his objection.
                        The SPEAKER. In drawing orders for per diem the Chair
                            is limited to the actual term of service. It was therefore that he did
                            not feel at liberty to sign Mr. Lee's order without the order of the
                            House.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The Chair was acting under the law and could not do
                            otherwise.
                    

                    
                         MILEAGE.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, submitted the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That each member of the
                                            House Committees on State Prisons be
                                        allowed mileage for going to and returning from said
                                        Prisons.
                                
                            
                        
                        He said there was a disposition to refuse this, but it had always been
                            customary to make this allowance. He submitted that It was not treating
                            members fairly or justly to refuse this allowance. He did not ask for
                            $5, or $10-but for simple justice, and that was the allowance of
                            mileage.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, desired to amend by including in the resolution
                            the members of the committee on Education for mileage
                            whilst they were looking after a location for the Agricultural
                            College.
                        Mr. RHOADS thought it was the duty of the House to bear their
                            expenses--simply pay their railroad fare: but to pay fare and allow
                            mileage was not fair.
                        Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay. An attempt had been made to obtain expenses, but it
                            failed.
                        Mr. RHOADS. Had not a resolution been already passed for that?
                        Mr. HIGGINS knew that some of the members of these committees had rode
                            all night two or three nights, and he submitted that they ought to be
                            allowed something extra.
                        
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren demanded the previous question; and, under its
                            force, the resolution was rejected--affirmative 36, negative 37.
                    

                    
                         WITNESSES.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House took up Mr. Newcomb's bill [H. R. 19] in relation to
                            witnesses, with the engrossed amendments of the Senate thereto: which
                            were read by the clerk. 
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House concurred in the amendments.
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM. the House took up Mr. Emerson's bill [H. R. No. 15--see page 57--there
                            erroneously ascribed to Mr. Spencer] with the engrossed amendment of the
                            Senate;
                        The amendment was concurred in.
                    
                    
                         THE SPECIFIC BILL.
                        On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House took up the specific appropriation
                            bill [H.R. 200]--the question being on Mr. Griffith's amendment for
                            allowance, of expenses to the members of the Prison
                                Committees.
                        
                        The amendment was rejected--affirmative 18, negative 36.
                        The several amendments by the Committee on Ways and
                                Means were then agreed to.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted an additional section for allowances to E. J.
                            Metzger, Holloway & Douglass, and others. 
                        Mr. HIGGINS moved that the allowance to Holloway & Douglass be
                            stricken out. He had paid his private bills. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said the printers had no other way of getting their pay for
                            newspapers furnished through the stationary clerk. He explained.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, moved to make the allowance of the Speaker's
                            clerk equal with the other clerks of the House. 
                        These amendments were agreed to. 
                        And then the bill was ordered to the third reading, and read a third
                            time.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK (by unanimous consent) proposed $1500 for 600 copies of the
                            BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of the Proceedings and Debates of the
                            present session of the General Assembly, or so much thereof as may be
                            necessary to pay for the same at two-thirds of a cent per page per copy. 
                        Mr. NEWCOMB proposed $1200 for 600 copies.
                        The latter amendment was adopted without a division.
                        Mr. BOYD proposed an allowance of $25,00 to A. P. Newkirk for services in
                            the organization of the House of Representatives for the year 1863.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the balance of the account of Samuel L. Rugg, late
                            Superintendent of Public Instruction, for $981.10 actually paid out by
                            him. 
                        Mr. BOYD made a statement of the case.
                         Mr. BUSKIRK called for the reading again of the allowance for the
                            BREVIER REPORTS.
                        Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, proposed to add, that one copy thereof for each
                            member and elective officer of the House be bound in sheep.
                         It was taken by consent. 
                        
                        The Specific bill was then passed the final reading--yeas 70, nays 4.
                    
                    
                    
                         THE CALENDAR OF SENATE BILLS.
                        Mr. COFFROTH moved that the rules be suspended for the consideration of
                            bills from the Senate on the third reading.
                        It was agreed to.
                    
                    
                         MOTION TO POSTPONE ACTIONS AT LAW.
                        
                        

                        On motion by Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, the House took up the bill [S. 168.] to amend section ,322
                            of the Practice Act, [with reference to motion to postpone actions on
                            account of absence of witnesses affidavit,] and it was ordered to the
                            third reading, read the third time, and passed the House--yeas 73, nays
                            0

                    
                    
                         COUNTY TREASURERS.
                        
                        

                        The bill  [S 14] to amend section
                            1 of the County Treasurer's Act, of June 14, 1852, coming up--it was
                            ordered to the third reading, read the third time and passed the
                            House--yeas 70, nays 2.

                    
                    
                         SWAMP LAND BOOKS.
                        
                        

                        The joint resolution  [S. No.
                                11,] requesting the Governor to appoint some suitable person
                            to revise the Swamp Land books in the office of the Auditor of
                            State,--coming up--it was ordered to the third reading, read the third
                            time and passed--yeas 73, nays 0.

                    
                    
                         TURNPIKE TOLLS.
                        The bill, [S. 65.] to amend section 13 of the Plank and Gravel Road Act
                            of May 12, 1852, coming up--
                        Mr. OLLEMAN opposed the bill. He said these plank and gravel roads were
                            originally constructed by the people along their lines, and had been
                            chiefly sold to capitalists. As a director of a road, and a farmer, he
                            hoped the House would not consent to nearly double the tolls for the
                            benefit of the new owners.
                        Mr. HOWARD. The bill raises the toll for a horse and vehicle one cent a
                            mile. The toll for two horses and wagon five miles, according to this
                            bill would be about 40 cents. He thought that too steep : and in view of
                            all the facts, he thought the bill in its present shape ought not to
                            pass. The present tolls were about high enough.
                        Mr. RICK had been informed that the roads could not be kept up under the
                            present rates, especially where the soil is clayey.
                        It was then laid on the table for the present.
                    
                    
                         SCHOOLS.
                        The Senate joint resolution to amend the constitution so as to give
                            additional powers to cities and towns with reference to Schools, coming
                            up
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said if this were submitted to the people, it would exclude
                            the possibility for two years of submitting any other amendment of the
                            constitution.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB If we meet in extra session, we shall be the same General
                            Assembly, and may propose other amendments.
                        Mr. WOODS spoke in favor of the proposition.
                        
                        The joint resolution was defeated--yeas 41. nays 31--a constitutional
                            majority not voting in the affirmative.
                        The Senate joint resolution No. 3, relative to conditional amendment for
                            schools, was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                         TWELTH CIRCUIT.
                        
                        

                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill [S.
                                68.] fixing the time of holding courts in the Twelfth Judicial
                            Circuit, was taken up, and passed the final reading in the House--yeas
                            70, nays 0.

                        The bill  [S. 63] to prohibit
                            certain county officers from practicing law, coming up--
                        On motion by Mr. HIGGINS, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock, P.
                            M.
                    
                    
                         AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed at 2 o'clock P. M., stating the opinion of the Chair,
                            that there was not a quorum within the Bar, and a roll-call was ordered
                            and proceeded till the fact of a quorum was determined.
                        Mr. ABBETT submitted an order by way of resolution, allowing the three
                            firemen of the Hall $31 each for extra service.
                        It was adopted.
                        Mr. SIM submitted a resolution to allow to A. J. Casteter, stationery
                            clerk, and his two assistants, one dollar a day, extra of the $5
                            heretofore allowed, as to other clerks of the House.
                        
                        It was adopted--yeas 38, nays 32.
                        Mr. COX submitted an order, allowing to Martin Tyner $2 a day for
                            doorkeeper service for the Committee on Ways and
                                Means.
                        It was adopted.

                        
                             CYRUS L. DUNHAM.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB called for the special order, the resolution which he
                                offered in relation to the gentleman from Floyd, [Mr. Durham.]
                            Mr. BROWN. The gentleman from Floyd has been arrested by some outlaws
                                of the city, but we expect he will be back here shortly.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. The object he had in view was simply to get this
                                resolution out of the way.
                            Mr. COFFROTH would not pass this matter over. It was a grave charge
                                against a gentleman on this floor, and is worthy ot the
                                consideration of the House ; and the gentleman is entitled to a
                                respectful hearing. I simply have to say now that about a half an
                                hour since, upon the complaint of one of the doorkeepers, as I
                                understand,--not upon the complaint of Capt. Browning--some half
                                dozen individuals bearing the livery of policemen of this city
                                surrounded the gentleman from Floyd and proposed to drag him off to
                                some police court. I happened to be present at the  time and other gentlemen here ; and
                                all of us without respect to party felt indignant at the conduct of
                                these policemen. I myself, being fully authorized to do so. proposed
                                to give them band in ten, twenty or fifty thousand dollars that the
                                gentleman from Floyd would appear at any time and before any court
                                to which they would call him to answer. But this did not suit their
                                purpose. It seemed to be their purpose to inflict an indignity upon
                                him by dragging him off, and immediately he was surrounded, and the
                                offer of bail was of no avail whatever. I submit, therefore, that
                                under the circumstances the House ought to postpone this matter for
                                thirty minutes,and then the gentleman from Floyd will be here.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe. Was there not a warrant commanding them to
                                bring him forthwith?
                            Mr. COFFROTH. Suppose there was. Does not the gentleman know that
                                half a dozen Republicans and Democrats were ready to pledge
                                themselves that the gentleman from Floyd would answer? He insisted
                                that it was an outrage for the police to come here and brandish
                                their bowie knives and revolvers. It simply indicated the character
                                of a people that would make officers of such a class of men.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB submitted whether it was competent for the gentleman to
                                animadvert on the character of the people of Indianapolis.
                             Mr. COFFROTH. He would except the gentleman from Marion, [Mr.
                                Newcomb.] He was simply asking that this resolution be postponed
                                till 3 o'clock.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to make it the special order for 8 o'clock.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker the gentleman from Floyd is here and I
                                withdraw the motion to postpone.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB urged his motion to postpone till 8 o'clock.
                            VOICES"No," No." "No more legislation to-day till this is done."
                            Mr. COFFROTH. We have no more legislative duties to perform till this
                                matter is disposed of.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB said his object was to get though, with this, and
                                consider something else. As to the imputation of the gentleman, that
                                he was actuated by ill-feeling to the gentleman from Floyd, that was
                                a mistake. His intercourse with that gentleman had been friendly.
                                But he thought it was due to the dignity of the House to introduce
                                this resolution, and he professed that he had no party or personal
                                feeling in the matter. The House of course would act its own
                                pleasure. He was not going to propose to postpone with a view of
                                staving off the matter beyond the adjournment, nor for the purpose
                                of embarrassing the gentleman from Floyd or the gentleman from
                                Huntington, [Mr. Coffroth. ] He still thought it best to postpone,
                                but if gentlemen are determined that no more legislation shall be
                                done till this is disposed of he did not, want to be in the way of
                                legislation.
                            Mr. DUNHAM had just got into the House and the first thing he had to
                                say was that he had just got out of limbo, for which I am much
                                obliged to my friends. I hope that my friends, if I have any on this
                                floor, will consider this matter calmly and considerately, and
                                whatever decision they may choose to make I shall most cheerfully
                                abide by it. I am a law-abiding man. I believe a little in the
                                higher law but do not often evince it. But in this body I am under
                                the civil authorities of the land, and I believe the constitution
                                and civil law to be the supreme law of the land. I have already
                                bowed to it once today and I shall bow to it again respectfully and
                                cordially in this case whatever may be the decision of the House.
                                But it was my object to say, it gentlemen will pardon me; that I
                                could scarcely believe the gentleman from Marion could be actuated
                                by anything like unkind personal feeling. The gentleman and myself
                                have been acquainted ever since we were young men--and this is a
                                much longer time than delicacy will allow me to mention. Therefore I
                                shall not speak of our relations further than to say they have
                                always been of a cordial and friendly character. I have no doubt
                                that the gentleman has acted upon what he felt at the time to be his
                                public duty. But still I think it quite likely that the gentleman's
                                sense of public duty might have been stimulated somewhat by the
                                excitement the moment, Had that entirely passed away I doubt whether
                                he would have introduced the resolution. I have no resentments, sir
                                whatever towards the Doorkeeper, [Capt. Browning.]I have known him
                                for a long time. He and I have been fast friends for the last ten or
                                twelve years ; and I here say in all sincerity that I have not a
                                scintilla of resentment toward him. I felt for the moment that he
                                had trespassed on my rights as a citizen. If I was in error I abide
                                the consequences ; and to those consequences I shall submit with all
                                the grace I can.
                            Mr. KILGORE. The gentleman from Huntington has, I think, made an
                                unjust assault upon the police of the city by stating that they had
                                dragged off the gentleman from Floyd, refusing to recognize
                                bail.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. At first they did. But after a little talk--for Mr.
                                Speaker, I am a persuasive man--they yielded.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. I desire to do this justice to the doorkeeper, Captain
                                Browning. It was not on his affidavit that the gentleman was
                                arrested. He did not know the fact till the last five minutes.
                            Mr.COFFROTH Who made the affidavit?
                            
                            Mr. DUNHAM. I do not know, and I care less. I know very well Mr.
                                Speaker, that I violated the civil law. But fortunately I had a
                                little money--a circumstance which I believe every member on this
                                floor cannot always boast of--and I paid the fine.
                            Mr. BUSKlRK. Captain Browning requests me to say for him that he has
                                had nothing to do with the arrest of the gentleman from Floyd, and
                                regrets that any steps were taken in the matter.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. I now move that the resolution be postponed till 8
                                o'clock this evening.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. If the gentleman would consult my feelings I would rather
                                it would be done with now. For if I am to be off I want to pack my
                                trunk and get ready, to-morrow is the Sabbath and I want to set my
                                house in order.
                            Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker. I beg leave to amend the motion of the
                                gentleman from Marion, by proposing that this matter be indefinitely
                                postponed.
                            Messrs. OLLEMAN and BONNER demanded the yeas and nays on indefinate
                                postponement.
                            
                            And it was decided in the affirmative--yeas 59. nays 26.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker. As the resolution is now indefinitely
                                postponed I feel that I owe it to the dignity of the House and to
                                myself to say, that, so far as any conduct of mine was a breach of
                                the decorum of this House. I desire to apologize to the House for
                                it. And as to the doorkeeper I never had and I have not now the
                                slightest ill feeling toward him.
                        
                        
                             LAW PRACTICE PROHIBITION.
                            
                            The PRESIDING OFFICER now returned to the calender of Senate bills on
                                the third reading.
                            The bill  [S. 63,] to prohibit
                                the Judges and certain county officers from practicing law, coming
                                up, unfinished--
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. Yesterday the salary bill was passed giving the common
                                Pleas Judge $1500 which would be sufficient to enable him to devote
                                himself exclusively to his duties as Judge ; he had therefore
                                proposed in the substitute for the bill, to exclude the common Pleas
                                Judges from practice.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. He made a suggestion against allowing the Common Pleas
                                Judge to practice, without caring whether it were regarded or not,
                                or whether the amendment was adopted or not.
                            And then, under the force of the previous question--the substitute
                                amendment was adopted, and the bill as amended, was ordered to the
                                third reading, and read the third time.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK explained that the bill prohibits the judges from
                                practicing law, and county officers from practicing law in the
                                courts of their own county. 
                            

                            The bill was then passed the House--yeas 65, nays 14,--with an
                                amendment of the title.

                            Mr. HIGGINS submitted a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing
                                the Committee on Ways and Means to consider the
                                Bank Department of the Auditor's office.
                        
                        
                             REPORTER TO THE SUPREME COURT.
                            The bill [S. 101,] relative to
                                the Reporter of the Supreme Court and the publication of the
                                decisions of said court, coming up it was ordered to the third
                                reading, and read the third time.
                             Mr. NEWCOMB. It made no change in the law, except to increase the
                                pay of the Reporter. This proposition will make the reports cost the
                                State $4.50 a volume, instead of $3, the present statute price. 
                            Mr. PETTIT. There was one thing in the bill that ought to be got rid
                                of; it is that these reports shall not be accessible to the public.
                                It is made incompetent; for any other person than the Reporter to
                                publish a decision, of a Judge of the Supreme Court. If he does it
                                he is liable to penalty of the law of copy-right. These decisions
                                are the common property of all--and hence his aversion to the bill.
                                The Reporter can exclude any publication of these decisions but his
                                own.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. There was not in the bill the change of a syllable, with
                                regard to copy right, as it stands now in the law. The law provides
                                that a brief abstract of these decisions may be printed in the
                                newspapers. The Reporter could not have the benefit of copy-right
                                till after the book is published, when the decisions would not be
                                sought for by the newspapers, Then the profession did not depend on
                                the newspapers for these decisions.
                            
                             The bill was rejected--yeas 37, nays 43.

                            The bill  [S. 173,] to enable
                                boards of trustees of incorporated towns to authorize street
                                enclosures for shade and ornamental purposes,--coming up--it was
                                ordered to the third reading, read the third time and, passed--yeas
                                61, nays 9.

                            The bill [S. 100,] fixing the
                                compensation of Township Assessors, coming up, it was ordered to the
                                third reading, read the third time and passed--yeas 61, nays 8.

                        
                        
                             ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.
                            On motion by Mr. HIGGINS, his legalization bill [H. R. 27,] to
                                legalize certain acknowledgements of deeds--coming up--it was
                                ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.
                            Mr. HIGGINS said, it was to legalize acknowledgements as may have
                                been made by a notany public, after the expiration of his
                                commission.
                            
                            The bill was passed the House--yeas 66, nays 4.
                        
                        
                        
                             RECORDS.
                            On motion by Mr. JOHNSON, the bill [S. 150,] to amend the act to provide against the
                                consequences of the destruction of records, was taken up and passed
                                to the second reading.
                            
                            On his further motion, (the constitutional restriction being
                                suspended for the purpose,) the bill was read the second time by
                                title, ordered to the third reading, read the third time and
                                passed--yeas 70, nays 0.
                            Mr. COFFROTH rose to a privilege question. In the course of his
                                remarks soon after dinner to-day, he took occasion, (because he
                                thought it to be his duty,) to animadvert on the conduct of the
                                police of this city in the matter of the arrest of the gentleman
                                from Floyd. He had since been informed by Col. Dunham, that he was
                                treated by the Chief of Police [Mr. Kramer,] with the utmost
                                kindness and courtesy. He wished to make this statement for the
                                benefit of the Chief of Police of this city. He would say also in
                                this connection, that he happened at the door of the Bates House at
                                the time of the arrest of the gentleman from Floyd, and heard the
                                gentleman telling them that his friends would be responsible for his
                                appearance ; and I immediately pledged my word that he should be
                                there at any hour or moment. But the police officers at once
                                refused. I then tendered a bond for $50,000. That was also refused.
                                Best I am informed that the Chief of Police [Mr. Kramer,] had no
                                part in refusing my word, or that of the gentleman from Delaware,
                                and the gentleman from Floyd.
                            He desired also to call the attention of the House to the privilege
                                of a member of the General Assembly. The constitution provides that
                                no member shall be subject to arrest during the session of the
                                General Assembly, except for treason and a breach of the peace. This
                                was claimed to have been a breach of the peace. But he would submit,
                                that, under such circumstances, a member is not subject to arrest,
                                except by permission of the House. He showed from Jefferson's
                                Manual, that the case is first to be laid before the House, that it
                                may judge of the facts and the grounds of the accusation, and how
                                far the manner of the trial shall restrict the rights of the
                                Legislature. Otherwise any designing man in power might destroy a
                                quorum of the House. He would add, on his own part, that if on any
                                occasion when questions implying intolerance or personal unkindness
                                have been sprung in the House, he has indulged in any words of
                                unkindness, in a few moments after he has regretted it.
                            Mr. DUNHAM said in this connection, with reference to the Chief of
                                Police, who was acting as Deputy Sheriff in his unfortunate arrest,
                                having been censured for his conduct,--that he must admit, that,
                                though one or two of the policemen behaved rudely in the matter, so
                                far as the Chief of Police was concerned he must bear this
                                testimony, that he is a gentleman in every sense of the word.

                                    135,] to amend the charter of the city of Evansville, was
                                taken up.
                            On motion by Mr. BRANHAM. (the constitutional restriction being

                                title, and the third time by sections.
                            

                            The bill passed the House without amendment--yeas 65, nays 4.

                            On motion by Mr. BROWN, (the constitutional restriction being

                             AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE SCRIP.
                            On motion by Mr. PETTIT, (Mr. Henricks in the Chair.) the bill [S. 119.] accepting the grant
                                of land made by Congress for the endowment of an Agricultural
                                College, was taken up and passed to the second reading; and then
                                (under a dispensation,) it was ordered to the third reading.
                            Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, desired to offer an amendment; but
                                objection being made--
                            On his motion (conformably to a previous order moved by Mr. Gregory,
                                of Montgomery.) the House took a recess till 7 1/2 o'clock p. m.
                        
                    
                    
                        NIGHT SESSION.
                        The SPEAKER resumed at 7 1/2 oclock, and directed the roll call, which
                            proceeded till a quorum was determined.
                        The SPEAKER stated the unfinished order, viz : the consideration of the
                            bill [S. 119]--the question
                            being, Shall it pass?
                        Mr. BUSKIRK stated that the bill simply accepts the congressional land
                            grant of 30,000 acres to each Senator and Representative in
                            Congress--(390,000 acres--) without locating the institution.
                        
                        The bill passed the House--yeas 64, nays 3.

                        
                            SUPREME COURT REPORTER.
                            
                            Mr. BUSKIRK moved for another vote on the passage of the Supreme
                                Court Reporter's bill  [S.
                                    101.]
                            The motion was agreed to.
                            He then proposed to amend the bill, by inserting the words "after the
                                same is published," and striking out the copy-right clause.
                            

                            The amendments were agreed to : and then the bill passed the
                                House--yeas 68, nays 1.

                            On motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the bill 
                                    [S. No 68.] to change the name of the Terre Haute and
                                Richmond Railroad company: [It extends the time seven years for the
                                company to complete their road to the Illinois line:] was taken up
                                and (the constitutional restriction being suspended for the purpose)
                                it was carried to the final passage without amendment--yeas 63. nays
                                4.


                            Mr. SIM submitted a resolution to allow certain assistant doorkeepers
                                and others Of the House police one dollar a day in addition to what
                                has been already allowed to them. It was laid on the table.
                            Mr. SHOAFF of Allen, submitted a resolution for an order that the
                                Secretary of State be required to cause the enrolled act known as
                                the dog law, to be printed and sent to the Township Trustees tor
                                information of the duties required of them by that act.
                            It was adopted. 
                        
                        
                            PERSONAL.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK rose to a privilege question. It was due to the gentleman
                                from Wabash [Mr. Speaker Pettit] and the gentleman from Cuss, [Mr.
                                Lasselle,] that I should make an explanation. Pending the discussion
                                of the question with reference to the order of business in the
                                latter part of last week, frequent allusions were made to what
                                transpired in a Democratic caucus held about that time. Sometime
                                Friday or Saturday, I had a conversation with the gentleman from
                                Wabash, in which I stated to him that the caucus had not acted as
                                stated, but that it was true, that they did pass a resolution. I did
                                not place any limitation as to the action of the caucus. A short
                                time afterwards the gentleman from Wabash made a speech, in which he
                                said that the Democratic caucus had voted by resolution not to
                                suspend the rules during the session. The gentleman from Cass rose
                                and contradicted the statement. The gentleman from Wabash then said
                                that he had been so informed. And I presume the gentleman was misled
                                by my remark. I placed no limitation upon icy remark, except to say
                                that it was a retaliatory measure. I suppose that my remark led the
                                gentleman from Wabash into the mistake. There was apparent
                                contradiction between these gentlemen, but I am satisfied that both
                                intended to state the matter correctly.
                            Mr. DUNHAM, wished the gentleman to state, that the only action in
                                the Democratic caucus was this : That if an illiberal course should
                                be pursued towards us, by keeping down measures in which the
                                minority was interested, we would retaliate simply by calling the
                                yeas and nays.
                            Mr. COFFROTH. There was no resolution about it, in the caucus; but
                                simply an understanding with reference to dilatory motions, if there
                                was a purpose on the part of the majority to postpone measures of
                                the minority, the only way to protect ourselves was to vote against
                                suspensions of the order of business.
                            Mr. BROWN asked whether the understanding was not restricted to
                                measures peculiarly odious to us?
                            Mr. DUNHAM. Without referring at all to the appropriation bills. It
                                was simply a matter of self protection.
                            Mr. BUSKIRK. My only purpose was to reconcile the apparent conflict
                                of statements between the gentleman from Wabash and the gentleman
                                from Cass--what I regard as an act of justice to these
                                gentlemen.
                            Mr. Speaker PETTIT, (Mr. Henricks ia the Chair ) I have felt
                                confident, from the time the gentleman from Cass used the language
                                which seemed to conflict with the language I used, that gentlemen
                                wonld do themselves the justice to explain. It was not alone on the
                                remark of the gentleman  from
                                Monroe, [Mr. Buskirk,] that I based my statement. I heard from other
                                gentlemen the same remark. And, as I then said, my rehearsal of the
                                matter was not for the purpose of embarrassing any one as my
                                informant. My information was simply of this character : that a
                                resolution had been adopted at a Democratic meeting, by which it was
                                determined to resist all suspensions of the rules. The sketch made
                                by the Reporters does me injustice. I do not think that I said that
                                the resolution went to the extent of suspending the rules during the
                                session. But I could only infer that it was intended to operate
                                during the whole session. I so understood it by the conversation
                                with the gentleman from Monroe, in which I expressed my surprise
                                that they should combine against taking up the appropriation bills
                                which the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr. Branham.] moved to take up.
                                And when I asked the gentleman from Monroe, he told me it was
                                resolved as an agreement in caucus. The language of the gentleman
                                from Cass, [Mr. Lassalle,] was that they adopted no such resolution.
                                The House has not understood me to say that there was a resolution
                                in writing ; but it was an agreement. I beg to say farther that when
                                this allusion was made it was not with a view of criticising the
                                minority ; but only to indicate the seriousness of the matter of
                                embarrassing the public business. And my friends about me had
                                similar information, without putting any limitation on the
                                matter.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. The gentleman says he had understood that the minority
                                were going to vote against taking up the appropriation bills. I did
                                so vote once against taking up an appropriation bill ; but I did it
                                at the solicitation of my Republican friend here [Mr. Rhoads,] who
                                had his pet measure in his mind with regard to the schools. Out of
                                sheer kindness and good neighborhood to him I did it.
                            Mr. LASSALLE stated that he was not correctly reported. My
                                contradiction intended to go to the extent of denying the
                                information of the gentleman from Wabash [Mr. Pettit,] whose
                                statement I understood to be that the resolve not to suspend the
                                order of business was to go to the end of the session. I did not
                                deny the statement in toto. I excepted as to that point of it. I
                                asserted that the Democratic caucus had not on that occasion, nor
                                any other, resolved to refuse to suspend the rules until the close
                                of the session. That was the only statement of the gentleman which I
                                intended to contradict. I made that in good faith and still adhere
                                to it. I was not permitted to go on and make a full statement. 
                        
                        
                            INDIANA FEMALE COLLEGE.
                            
                            On the motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the bill [S. 181] to amend the charter
                                of the Indianapolis Female College, was taken up, and (there being a
                                dispensation ordered for the purpose, it was carried to the final
                                passage--yeas 67, nays 0. 
                        
                        
                            ROADS AND HIGHWAYS.
                            On motion by Mr. WRIGHT, the bill [S. 56,] for amendment of the act
                                providing for the election or appointment of Supervisors of
                                highways, was taken up,and (under a dispensation.) it was carried to
                                the final reading.
                            Mr. JAMES hoped the bill would not pass. He thought it taxed the
                                people too heavily.
                            Mr. WRIGHT. Where the labor is insufficient, it authorizes the
                                supervisors to levy a tax of 10 cents on the $100 of property in the
                                district.
                            
                            The bill was rejected--yeas 10, nays 57.

                                125,] returned the same, and recommended that it be laid on the
                                table.

                            On motion of Mr. LOCKHART the bill 
                                    [S. 28,] making it a felony to poison stock, was taken
                                up--and, (under a dispensation.) it was carried to the final reading
                                and passed the House--yeas 66, nays 2.

                             On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, (under a dispensation of the
                                constitutional restriction,) the bill [S. 68,] to repeal the act
                                establishing the free negro colonization agency, was taken up and
                                carried to the final passage without amendment--yeas 63. nays 3.

                                the bill [S. 178.]authorizing
                                the construction of Water Works in cities, having special reference
                                to the wants of the city of Evansville, was taken up and carried to
                                the final passage--yeas 67, nays 1.
                            On motion of Mr. GRIFFITH, Mr. Shoaff's resolution with reference to
                                printing the Dog law, was taken up and made a concurrent resolution,
                                and so it was again adopted by the House.

                            Mr. BRANHAM submitted a resolution to the following effect:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That the Adjutant General be
                                            requested to make out a full and complete report from
                                            papers in his office which shall embrace the name age,
                                            and death of every officer enlisted in the service of
                                            the United States during the present war, with such
                                            other information as in his judgment may be of public
                                            interest; and that 2,000 copies thereof shall be printed

                                was taken up and carried to the final reading; but the lateness of
                                the hour forbade action; and the motion was withdrawn.
                        
                        
                            REVISION OF THE STATUTES.

                                        Be it resolved by the House of
                                                Representatives of the State of Indiana, That
                                            there be a committee consisting of three, two on the

                                            next meeting of the Legislature of the State of Indiana
                                            whether Special or Regular.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Pending which--at 12:20 A. M, Sunday, 
                            On motion by Mr. CHAMBERS, the House adjourned till Monday morning at
                                nine o'clock.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    IN SENATE.
                    
                         MONDAY, March 6, 1865.
                    
                     The Senate met at 9 o'clock a. m.
                     The journal of Saturday was being read, when--
                    On motion by Mr. COBB its further reading was dispensed with.
                    
                        JOURNALS, LAWS AND BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS.
                        Mr. DYKES offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Secretary of State be
                                        authorized to procure and send to each member of the Senate
                                        and to the officers and reporters thereof, two copies of the

                                        Acts of the present session, all to be bound in full
                                        sheep.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. OYLER moved to amend by striking out the word "two" where it refers
                            to the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS and inserting in lieu thereof the
                            word "three."
                        The amendment was agreed to.
                        And then the resolution as amended was adopted.
                        Mr. CORBIN offered the following :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the Auditor of State be and
                                        he is hereby directed to draw his warrant on the State

                                        so much thereof as may be necessary to pay two-thirds of a
                                        cent a page per copy for six hundred copies--being the usual
                                        number furnished the Senate every session since 1857--of the

                                        express to each Senator as soon as possible after the
                                        adjournment.

                                    YEAS--Messrs, Bennett, Bonham, Bradley,Brown of Hamilton,
                                        Brown, of Wells, Carson, Cason. Chapman, Corbin, Cullen,
                                        Culver, Douglas, Dunning, Dykes, Gifford, Hord, Marshall,
                                        McClurg, Newlin, Niles, Oyler, Peden, Staggs, Thompson, Van
                                        Buskirk, Williams, Woods, Wright--28.
                                    NAYS-Messrs Allison, Barker, Beeson, Bowman, Cobb, Davis,
                                        English, Gaff, Hyatt, Mason, Noyes, Richmond, Terry, Vawter,
                                        Ward--15.
                                
                            
                        
                        So the resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        A MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR
                        announced his approval of certain acts and a joint resolution.
                        
                         Mr. OYLER took occasion to express it as his opinion that the Governor
                            had no right to sign or approve, or in any manner to have anything to do
                            with any joint resolution except as the same may be directory to him. If
                            the Governor approves he may disapprove of a joint resolution. It has
                            been the custom for the Governor to approve and sign joint resolutions,
                            but the constitution does not provide for it. The 4th joint rule
                            provides that joint resolutions shall be sent to the Governor for his
                            approbation and signature, while the constitution says the Governor has
                            nothing to do with joint resolutions ; nor does the constitution speak
                            of their going to the Governor at all. Mr. O. entered his protest
                            against this irregular way of doing business.
                    
                    
                        LENGTH OF THE SESSION.
                        Mr. NILES submitted the following :
                        Mr. PRESIDENT: The Judiciary
                                Committee to whom was referred the Message of the Governor
                            in regard to the right to prolong the present session of the General
                            Assembly, report that they have spent considerable time in consultation
                            on the subject without having arrived at a unanimous conclusion. 
                        But the Committee are of opinion that it is not advisable to depart from
                            the established usage and to now unsettle what has been for fourteen
                            years, the practical construction of the constitution.
                        The Committee therefore recommend that the session be not extended beyond
                            sixty one days, counting by revolutions of the earth on its axis.
                        The report was concurred in.
                        Mr. DOWNEY submitted the following :
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                    Mr. PRESIDENT : The majority of the
                                            Judiciary Committee to whom was
                                        referred the question in regard, to the length of the
                                        sessions under the constitution, according to order, report
                                        as follows:
                                    This session of the general assembly began on the 5th day of
                                        January, 1865, and the question is, when must it end ? The
                                        language of the constitution on the subject is found in
                                        section 29, of article 4, and is as follows : "No session of
                                        the general assembly, except the first under this
                                        constitution, shall extend beyond the term of sixty-one
                                        days, nor any special session beyond the term of forty
                                        days."
                                    Words are to be understood in their plain and ordinary sense.
                                        A "civil day," or a day when mentioned in a constitution or
                                        statute, means a period of twenty four hours, beginning and
                                        ending at 12 o'clock at night. Sunday is a day as well as
                                        week days.
                                    There is no difficulty in arriving at what is meant by the
                                        word "session." It means, in this instance, the time during
                                        which the Legislature sits, with occasional intermissions of
                                        a day, or more, until its final adjournment.
                                    The word "term" used in this clause of the constitution, and
                                        as used in eight or ten other places in, the same
                                        instrument, means a period, or length of time, from one
                                        given date to another. To find the true meaning of the word
                                        when it is used in the constitution we must look at other
                                        paats of that instrument, as well as the one under
                                        consideration. All parts of it were made at the same time
                                        and by the same persons. A strange use may be made of a word
                                        in an instrument, but if you find the word used in many
                                        other places in many places in the same paper, in the same
                                        sense, it must have the meaning which from the whole
                                        instrument the party intended it to have. We do not mean to
                                        say that the word is properly used in this instance We think
                                        it is not. Let us look to its meaning in ether places in the
                                        coustitution. In article 2, section 6, the word "term" is
                                        used with reference to the term during which a person may
                                        hold an office. In art. 4 sec. 5, it is said senators shall
                                        be chosen for the term of four years, and representatives
                                        for the term of two years. In art, 5, sec. 9, the oflicial
                                        term of the governor and lieutenant governor shall commence,
                                        &c. In the same article, sec. 22, it is provided that
                                        the governor's salary shall not be increased or diminished
                                        during the term for which he shall have been elected ; and
                                        in sec. 24: neither the governor nor lieutenant governor
                                        shall be eligible to any other office during the term for
                                        which he shall have been elected. In art. 7, sec. 9: circuit
                                        judges shall hold their office for the term of six years
                                        &c.; and in sec. 16 of the same article; no person
                                        ejected to any judicial office shall, during the term for
                                        which he was elected, &c. In the 5th clause of the
                                        schedule, the word is used, and in the 13th clause it is
                                        twice used in the same sense.
                                    We cannot see that it can make any difference whether the
                                        period of time is to be computed by days, weeks, months or
                                        years. It is a continuous period, made up of successive
                                        days, in either case; and as Sundays are days, why should
                                        they be excluded, unless the language or words used, and for
                                        which a proper construction is sought, so expressly
                                        require?
                                    Had the language of the constitution been that the general
                                        assembly should not "sit" or not be "in session" more than
                                        sixty-one days, it might then be construed to exclude all
                                        days when the legislature was not actually in session or
                                        doing business, as well Sundays as other days. At this
                                        session, the sixty-one days, if we include Sundays, expire
                                        on the 10th of March. Now, if the general assembly shall be
                                        in session on the 10th of March, is not that "beyond the
                                        term of sixty-one days" from the time the session began
                                        ?
                                    We think that where a period or term of time is to be
                                        reckoned in days, months or years, that Sundays must be
                                        included, unless expressly excluded. If money is to be paid,
                                        or any other act performed, in thirty, sixty, or any other
                                        number of days, the Sundays falling within that time must be
                                        counted. Such is the rule in computing the ten days notice
                                        to a party sued, and such is the rule where a party is
                                        required to appeal within a certain number of days. The
                                        Sundays are counted against him, and yet they are not days
                                        on which he should be engaged in preparing his defense or
                                        perfecting his appeal.
                                    Where it is intended that Sundays shall be excluded it is so
                                        expressed in the constitution, and in our statues, and as
                                        Sundays are excepted in this section in regard to the
                                        approval of bills by the governor, it furnishes ground to
                                        suppose that if it had been intended in the other case it
                                        would have been so expressed. 
                                    Sundays and certain holidays are spoken of as non-legislative
                                        days; but we do not understand by this that legislative
                                        business cannot be done on these days, but only that by a
                                        kind of common consent it is not done. It is expressly laid
                                        down in Cushing's Manual that legislative business may be
                                        done on Sunday, and instances can be cited where it has been
                                        done; but still he says Sunday is a non-legislative day. We
                                        must not be understood as saying that legislative business
                                        ought to be done on Sunday. But suppose the legislature
                                        should sit on each successive day from the commencement of
                                        the session, and suppose bills to have one of their
                                        indispensable readings, or to be passed on a Sunday, would
                                        the act be void? There is no provision in the state
                                        constitution which prevents the legislature from being in
                                        session on Sunday. Legislation is not enumerated among the
                                        acts prohibited by the Sunday law. If it was, might it not
                                        in some possible case become a work of "necessity" and for
                                        that reason be allowable.
                                    There was a reason for fixing upon sixty-one days as the
                                        length of a session, rather than some more convenient and an
                                        even number of days. By a previous section of the
                                        constitution the time when the sessions must begin was
                                        fixed. It was fixed for Thursday after the first Monday of
                                        January.- -Counting sixty days from that time and the
                                        sessions would always close, or the time would expire on
                                        Sunday. We know from some who were members  of the convention, and it is
                                        pretty commonly understood, that sixty days was the term
                                        first agreed on, and that the odd day was added to prevent
                                        the termination of the period on Sunday.
                                     The legislature had had some kind of limitation nf its
                                        session prior to the adoption of this constitution but as it
                                        was only by virtue of a statute; it was subject to change,
                                        and as we now recollect it operated only by way of reducing
                                        or cutting off pay after certain lapse of time. There is an
                                        able report on this Subject in house journal, pages 449-50,
                                        in which it is shown that Sundays must be included. 
                                    Contemporaneous construction of constitutions and statutes is
                                        of very great weight, in ascertaining their true meaning;
                                        and by this we mean not only what occurred at the exact
                                        time, but also that which prevailed soon afterwards. The
                                        reasons for this are that those who lived at the time, and
                                        who were acquainted with the causes which induced the making
                                        of the provision or enactment and first had occasion to act
                                        upon it, or construe it, are presumed to be better able to
                                        know its true construction than those who live at a more
                                        remote period.
                                    The first session of the legislature under the present
                                        constitution was unlimited as to its duration.--At the next
                                        session, that in 1853, very little legislation was necessary
                                        - and the term closed before the sixty-one days expired,
                                        Sundays included.
                                    At the session in 1837 the question was raised, and was
                                        settled by a concurrent resolution passed by both Houses,
                                        which is found on p. of the journal of the House. Then the
                                        session began on the 8th of January, and, according to the
                                        resolution, ended on the 9th day of March, which made just
                                        sixty-one days, Sundays included.
                                    At the session in 1859 (in House journal, page 908,) the
                                        opinion of the judiciary committee is given in accordance
                                        with our opinion. (See page 273 vol. II. of the BREVIER
                                        LEGISLATIVE REPORTS )
                                    At the session in 1861 the subject was referred, in the House
                                        to the judiciary committee, and their report is found on
                                        page 961. (See page 364, volume IV of the BREVIER
                                        LEGISLATIVE REPORTS ) This session began on the 10th of
                                        January and ended on the 11th of March, just sixty-one days,
                                        Sundays included. 
                                    At the session in 1863, and on the 12th day of February,
                                        1863, resolutions were introduced and adopted, as found on
                                        page 330 of the Senate journal, which show that it was then
                                        believed that the session ended in sixty-one days, Sundays
                                        included.
                                    For these reasons we come to the conclusion that the session
                                        must end at the expiration of the term of sixty-one days,
                                        including Sundays, and that bills could only be presented to
                                        the governor for approval as late as Saturday, the the [?]
                                        inst. We recommend the adoption of the same resolution which
                                        was adopted by both houses in 1837, changing only the dates
                                        to make it apply to the present year, as follows ;
                                    
                                        
                                            
                                                Resolved, That this session of
                                                  the general assembly, which began on the 5th day
                                                  of January, must end on the 6th of March, and that
                                                  bills could be presented to the governor as late
                                                  as the 4th.
                                            
                                        
                                    

                                    
                                         PARIS C. DUNNING, FRANCIS T. HORD, THOS. R. COBB,
                                            A. C. DOWNEY. 
                                    

                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. DOWNEY moved to reconsider the vote adopting the report submitted on
                            this subject by the Senator from Laporte.
                        Mr. CASON would prefer that the Tote should not be reconsidered. He was
                            not willing to concur in the argument made in the report just read. If
                            this matter be taken up and discussed now, it will take too long,and in
                            order to save time he would prefer to see it lie on the table.
                        Mr. DUNNING had not read the arguments in this report, but concurred in
                            its conclusions. He was better pleased with the first report than with
                            the resolution appended to the report made by the Senator from Ohio. His
                            judgment was that bills could be passed to-day and could be presented to
                            the Governor, and in that opinion he had the concurrence of the best
                            legal talent in the city. He had no doubt of the validity of any law
                            that may be passed to-day were that the only objection to it.
                        Mr. COBB insisted that both reports go upon the records. He favored the
                            motion to reconsider, though he endorsed the conclusions of the
                            report.
                        Mr. HORD also concurred in its conclusions and he desired that the other
                            report should be adopted. He had given this matter some little
                            investigation, and hoped it would be acted upon as argument for future
                            reference in settling this question.
                        Mr. BENNETT favored the first report. Can any action of this Senate
                            to-day bind the act of any succeeding legislature? Most assuredly not.
                            He thought the matter had better be allowed to rest where it is. He
                            didn't think we ought to decide this question now as there is no
                            necessity for it. He thought he could see that certain members desired
                            this Senate to be put upon the records as against the Governor and
                            Supreme Bench.
                        Mr. COBB thought the Governor or the Supreme Court had but little to do
                            with this question, and that this was an attempt to compel this
                            Legislature to continue its session wrongfully--a species of
                            intermeddling that was unwarranted.
                        Mr. CHAPMAN moved to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
                        This motion was agreed to by yeas 22, nays 21--as follows:

                        Mr. WILLIAMS moved that the last report submitted be adopted as the sense
                            of the Senate.

                        The Committee on Military Affairs reported that, upon
                            invitation they had examined the military Secretary's office and found
                            the arrangement and management of the same complete.
                    
                    
                        THE PENITENTIARIES.
                        Mr. ALLISON submitted the following:
                        Mr. PRESIDENT : The Committee on
                                Prisons would respectfully report that we visited the
                            Southern Prison and examined into the manner the same, its book accounts
                            had been kept, the treatment of the prisoners, &c , for the last two
                            years.
                        We cheerfully bear testimony to the faithfulness of the Warden and his
                            competency for the position as to the government of the Prison.
                        From the hasty examination we were compelled to give the books and
                            accounts of the Prison we are not prepared to give an opinion of their
                            condition, They seem to be kept in a manner that would preclude a proper
                            examination without evidence outside of the books themselves. For
                            instance, there is one item of expense as follows: For corn, $1,994.22.
                            We called the Warden's attention to the fact that the single item of
                            corn seemed large. He then stated to us that that item embraced several
                            other things besides corn. In that item we were interned was embraced
                            potatoes, $700,00, turnips and other vegetables. Now if the accounts are
                            allowed to be made up in this way, great frauds might be perpetrated in
                            the hands of a dishonest man ; for suppose you allow the item of corn,
                            as set forth,, to cover up potatoes and ether articles, a dishonest
                            Warden might embrace in his corn account any item of his, private
                            expenses and not be detected; or he might be allowed for the amount of
                            corn in one item and charge for the potatoes or other articles
                            separately.
                        We would respectfully suggest that the Warden and Clerk be required to
                            keep a carefully itemised account, charging himself with each sum
                            received ; for what, and of whom received, and for what expended.
                        Your Committee would further report that the Directors of said Prison
                            have either acted fraudulently or with a total disregard to the
                            interests of the State in the contracts of hiring the Prison labor. They
                            made contracts to run until November 1867, at 40 cents per day for each
                            convict, when it costs more than that amount to feed and clothe them
                            each, and when it must have been well known to the directors that they
                            could have hired the convicts at from 70 cents to one dollar per day But
                            if they could not get but forty cents per day which is less than the
                            cost of keeping, why encumber the State with contracts running to
                            1867?
                        Your Committee would also state that the same practice prevails at the
                            Southern Prison that prevails at the Northern Prison ;that of the Warden
                            and his deputy using the convict labor about their private business
                            without accounting to the State for the same; which we recommend be
                            discontinued.
                        Your Committee found the Prison in a clean, healthy condition. The
                            present contractors have put up a large amount of expensive machinery,
                            thereby affording ample opportunity for employing all the convicts
                            inside of the Prison Walls; and many of the prisoners, we were informed,
                            have learned useful trades since their confinement. This we think much
                            more desirable than the old mode of allowing the convicts to be employed
                            at day labor on the outside of the Prison.
                        Your Committee would further report that the prisoners are not allowed
                            any but corn bread. This we think is cruel, to confine even Prison
                            convicts on corn bread without a change.
                        Your Committee would further state that the Directors of the Southern
                            Prison have assured us from time to time that the Prison would be
                            self-sustaining; and yet this year we are asked for an appropriation of
                            $15,675.14 to pay off the indebtedness of the Prison; and for $25,000,00
                            to defray the expenses of the next two years, which the Committee think
                            does not sustain the oft repeated promise of its being
                            self-sustaining.
                        We therefore recommend the passage of Senate Bill 153 which provides for
                            the leasing of the Prisons North and South,, which if carried into
                            effect will be a saving to the State of fifty thousand dollars per
                            annum.
                        All of which is respectfully submitted.

                            matter in detail, and therefore submit the  matter to the Senate upon the various
                            statements and accompanying documents.
                        Subsequently this report was laid on the table.

                                thanks for the kind consideration with which they have treated me
                                during this session of the Senate. I appreciate most highly their
                                good opinion, and I assure them that I extend to each one upon this
                                floor my kindest regards. I trust that they may have a prosperous
                                journey to their respective homes ; and they shall always have my
                                best wishes for their'happiness.
                            Mr. NILES said : I cannot well resist the impulse to reply, that the
                                kind and respectful sentiments expressed by the President are
                                undoubtedly reciprocated, without distinction of party, by every
                                senator on this floor. I may add, that, during a laborious and
                                exciting session, there has not existed one iota of personal
                                un-kindness among senators. The memory of that fact will remain
                                among the pleasantest recollections of my life.
                            The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, I now declare the Senate adjourned sine die.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
                    
                         MONDAY, March 6, 1865.
                    
                    The SPEAKER took the Chair at 10 1/4 o'clock, A. M.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK moved to dispense with the reading of the journal of
                        Saturday.
                    Mr. DUNHAM objected.
                    Messrs. DUNHAM and THACHER demanded the yeas and nays on the motion.
                    Mr. BUSKIRK was willing to modify  his
                        motion so as to admit of the reading of that part which refers personally to
                        the gentleman from Floyd.
                    Mr. DUNHAM was obliged to the gentleman from Monroe,--but would say, so far
                        as he was personally concerned in the journal, he did not care a cent about
                        it.
                    
                    The yeas and nays were then ordered and taken, resulting--yeas 45, nays 24:
                        so the reading of the journal was dispensed with.
                    
                        PETITIONS.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB presented sundry petitions from his constituents on the
                            subject of Temperance, which were referred without reading.
                    
                    
                        STATE OFFICES.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK from the Committee on Ways and Means
                            returned the communication from the Governor with reference to the
                            procurement of comfortable buildings for the State offices (see page 134
                            of these Reports) and reported thereupon the following concurrent
                            resolution :
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved by the House of Representatives,
                                        (the Senate concurring therein) that the Auditor, Treasurer
                                        and Secretary of State, be and they are hereby empowered and
                                        directed to contract for purchase from the Bank of the State
                                        of Indiana, the premises heretofore occupied by the Bank of
                                        the State, situated on Illinois street and Kentucky Avenue,
                                        to be used for the offices of State; that said officers
                                        shall report their proceedings to the next session of the
                                        Legislature for its approval that if said officers can not
                                        purchase the said premises, then they shall make an
                                        arrangement with the Sinking Fund Commissioners to occupy
                                        the building now occupied by the Sinking Fund for the
                                        offices of State ; and that if the said officers can neither
                                        purchase the old Bank building nor occupy the Sinking Fund
                                        building, then they shall rent some safe and suitable
                                        building for the use of the State officers.
                                
                            
                        
                        The communication from the Governor on the subject was then read by the
                            clerk.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The Committee on Ways and Means came to
                            the conclusion, that the most suitable premises was the old Bank
                            building. The State officers were not authorized to make a final
                            purchase, but were to report terms to the next Session of the
                            Legislature.
                        Mr. DUNHAM characterized this report as "a job." It was nothing but a job
                            to put money into the pockets of contractors and favorites. Any man that
                            knew the old Bank building must know very well, that it is totally unfit
                            for State offices. He was in favor of erecting a suitable building for
                            State offices on the grounds of the State on the opposite side of the
                            street--a building, such as in architecture aim in all respects was
                            demanded by the public interests in view of the progress of the State in
                            wealth and prosperity.
                        Mr. HAMRICK concurred in the remarks of the gentleman from Floyd. The
                            State's grounds on the north, or the old Treasury lot--either would make
                            a suitable site for the new building.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The lot on the corner--the old Treasury house and lot--was
                            authorized to be sold, and perhaps already disposed of. The Bank
                            building was a good, substantial structure, and required but Safes,
                            &c., for the temporary accommodation of the officers of State
                        Mr. NEWCOMB. If it were " a job," it could not be completed till a future
                            Legislature should pass upon it. He hoped the resolution would be
                            adopted.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK, so far as he was concerned, knew nothing of the matter us "a
                            job." The subject had come regularly be fore the committee, and they had
                            reported upon it in accordance with conscientious views of the public
                            interest.
                        Mr. DUNHAM had not supposed for a moment, that the knowledge of "the job"
                            had come to the notice of the gentleman from Monroe. There was not a
                            gentleman on this floor who will not readily concede, that the gentleman
                            from Monroe is totally innocent of "jobs'' of any sort, public or
                            private.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The action of the Committee was in obedience to the order of
                            the House. But we were now paying $3,000 a year for office rent of rooms
                            totally unfit for the State offices
                        Mr. GREGORY of Warren demanded the previous question, and there was a
                            second, and under the pressure thereof, the vote on the resolution of
                            the committee was reported--yeas 40, nays 28--as follows :

                        So the concurrent resolution was adopted.
                    
                    
                        COMMITTEE BOOKS AND FILES.
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following:
                        Mr. SPEAKER : The Committee on Ways and Means beg
                            leave to report that all books and papers appertaining and belonging to

                            Librarian has been taken, which receipt accompanies and is made a part
                            of this report.

                                    Received of Mr. S. A. Hoover, Clerk of the Committee

                            together with the Librarian's receipt for the same ; and he asked that
                            said report be spread upon the Journal of the House.
                        It was so ordered.

                        Mr. RIFORD submitted the following:
                         Mr. SPEAKER : The Committee on County and
                                Township Business to whom was referred Mr. Griffith's bill

                            under consideration and have directed me to recommend that the same lay

                            certain joint resolution and papers, and asked that the Committee be
                            discharged from their further consideration.

                            where said bill is erroneously ascribed to Mr. Buskirk,) and reported
                            the request of said Committee that the same be restored to the files
                            without any recommendation. 
                    
                    
                        PENSIONS.

                            United States upon an equal footing with others, their representatives,
                            &c., injured or killed in the regular service of the United
                            States.
                        Mr. WOODS asked and obtained leave to withdraw from the files a deed and
                            certificate, the property of one of his constituents. 
                    
                    
                        LEGISLATIVE DAYS.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, submitted the following:
                        Mr. SPEAKER: The Special Committee to whom was
                            referred the message of the Governor in reference to the construction of
                            the duration of the term of the Legislature, whether sixty one
                            legislative days was intended to exclude Sundays,have had the same under
                            consideration, and have instructed me to report, that in the opinion of
                            the Committee, without entering into a discussion of authorities or
                            giving a legal reason for our conclusion, we have unanimously agreed
                            that it would be inexpedient to unsettle the now established rule of
                            construing the session to be sixty-one consecutive days including
                            Sundays.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK said he supposed there should be some action taken on this
                            report.
                        The SPEAKER. The Committee do not report back anything calling for
                            action.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The Chairman of the Committee on the part of the Senate
                            considerered it very important that action should be had--that there
                            should be a construction and decision one way or the other, and the
                            matter settled.
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM considered that there was not time to make up a satisfactory
                            decision.
                        On motion by Mr. KILGORE it was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                        ELECTION LAWS.
                        Mr. KILGORE submitted the following:
                        Mr. SPEAKER : The Committee on Elections to whom was
                            referred Mr. Henrick's bill [H. R. No. 36,] entitled an Act to amend the
                            eighteenth section of an Act entitled an Act regulating elections and
                            prescribing the duties of officers in relation thereto, have instructed
                            me to report the same back and recommend that it be laid on the
                            table.
                        Mr. KILGORE also submitted the following:
                        Mr. SPEAKER: The Committee on Elections to whom was
                            referred Mr. Higgin's bill [H. R. No. 87.] entitled an Act to amend
                            section 15, and to repeal sections 29 and 30 of an Act regulating
                            general elections, and prescribing the duties of certain officers in
                            relation thereto, approved June 7, 1852, have had the same under
                            consideration, and have instructed run to report the same back and to
                            recommendation that it be passed.
                    
                    
                        SPEAKER'S CLERK.
                        Mr. HENRICKS submitted a resolution to allow the Speaker's clerk $61 in
                            addition to the compensation already allowed to that officer.
                        It was adopted.
                    
                    
                        INDIANA OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS IN THE SERVICE OF THE
                            UNITED STATES.
                        Mr. TRUSLER offered the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved by the House of Representatives,
                                        (the Senate concurring,)

                                    
                                         That the people of the State of Indiana have
                                            observed with pride and satisfaction the gallant conduct
                                            of the officers and men in the volunteer service of the
                                            United States from this State, and that they desire,
                                            through their representatives, to express their high
                                            appreciation thereof and to congratulate them upon the
                                            glorious record they have made for themselves, their
                                            State and country.
                                         That the Secretary of State cause a sufficient
                                            number of copies of the above resolution to be printed,
                                            and that the Adjutant General be requested to forward
                                            the same to the several commanders of Indiana volunteer
                                            regiments and batteries, who will order the same to be
                                            read upon parade of their respective commands.
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. WOODS proposed to insert appropriately the words "and Navy."
                        Mr. NEWCOMB said we have no organization which represents the State in
                            the Navy,The resolution was adopted without amendment.
                    
                    
                        S. A. HOOVER--L. A. FOOT.
                        Mr. SHOAFF of Jay, submitted a resolution which was adopted, allowing to
                            S. A. Hoover and L. A. Foot, belonging to the clerical force of the
                            House one dollar per day in addition to what they have already
                            received.
                    
                    
                        THE CONTESTANTS AGAIN.
                        Mr. CHURCH submitted a resolution to, pay the actual expenses incurred by
                            Messrs. Miller, Lane, Hamrick, Puett and Colover in the election
                            contests in which they were concerned.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB desired to offer an amendment to pay to Mr. Hamilton the same
                            amount. The very large vote against this contestor had seemed to justify
                            the supposition that it was a mere vexatious contest. He desired to
                            remove this impression. He thought it was doing injustice to Mr.
                            Hamilton. That contest was undertaken upon the deposition of one man,
                            pointing strongly toward tampering with the ballot box; but that
                            individual afterwards modified his deposition so as to do away with it
                            altogether. There was certainly a legal question in the case which
                            justified Mr. Hamilton in making the contest--though he himself thought
                            Mr. Miller was entitled to his seat. He would not insist on the
                            amendment.
                        Mr. MILLER, of Tippecanoe, renewed the amendment conceding at the same
                            time that Mr. Hamilton was not entitled, to the seat. But the evidence
                            indicating the fraud alleged in the testimony as first reported and
                            afterwards withdrawn, would have compelled the committee to sustain the
                            contest of Mr. Hamilton.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, demanded the previous question; and there was a
                            second, and the main question was ordered, whereupon--
                        
                        Mr. Miller's amendment was rejected--affirative 19, negative not
                            counted.
                        And then Mr. Church's resolution was agreed to.
                    
                    
                        THANKS TO THE SPEAKER.
                        Mr. BOYD (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,) submitted a resolution, tendering
                            the thanks of the House of Representatives to the Hon. Jno. U. Pettit,
                            for the very able, impartial and dignified manner in which he has
                            discharged the duties of Speaker during the present session.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER announced that the resolution was adopted by
                            consent. 
                    
                    
                        DAVID STEVENSON.
                        Mr. BOYD submitted a resolution to allow to David Stevenson the sum of
                            $1020 for 152 copies of Gavin and Kurd's Revised Statutes ; and that the
                            same be stricken from the specific appropriation bill which has failed
                            to pass.
                        Mr. BOYD stated, that Mr. Stevenson had actually paid out the money for
                            these books.
                        Mr. BRANHAM asked whether these statutes were not sold for $7 a copy.
                        Mr. BOYD explained. As the matter stood it amounted virtually to a
                            contract. Consequently we ought to pay the amount he paid.
                        Mr. CHURCH. If Mr. Stevenson did not act as the agent of the House he was
                            unwilling to pay the price charged in the claim.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH had enquired of Merrill & Co. and learned from them that
                            the price  was $12. He was also
                            informed by Stewart & Bowen that the wholesale price was nine
                            dollars.
                        Mr. BRANHAM did not know the price but had been told by a man (Mr.
                            Bryant) who had been selling the Statutes, that they were sold for seven
                            dollars.
                        Mr. BOYD. Mr. Bryant was not selling them now.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. If the House were going to pass this resolution to pay for
                            these books, it was equally competent to vote the payment of every item
                            in the specific appropiation bill. Members of the prison Committees who
                            had visited the penitentiaries, and expended large sums of money in
                            their travels, will have to wait 2 years for their money. He considered
                            this an injustice, and hoped therefore, that the House would take up the
                            specific appropriation bill, and pass it through the Senate by
                            resolution. [Laughter.]
                        Mr. GRIFFITH could not see how that could be done. He referred to the
                            hardship likely to result to Mr. Braden.
                        Mr. BRANHAM had not intended seriously to pass the bill by resolution,
                            but he wanted the House to see what is justice in the case and do it. He
                            had not posted up the items of the specific bill, but there were in it
                            an aggregate appropriation of $35,000 for deficiencies25.000 of that
                            amount were for deficiencies to pay the specific appropriations that
                            should have been made by the last Legislature. If it is competent to
                            pass a resolution to pay one of these items, it was competent to pass a
                            resolution to pay them all.
                         Mr. GREGORY of Warren. Many of these claimants had spoken to him this
                            morning. He suggested a legal difficulty in the terms of the resolution
                            before the House, whilst he declared himself ready to do justice to the
                            late Librarian and all these claimants.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired the attention of the House with reference to the
                            point made by the gentleman from Jefferson,. The constitution provides
                            that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in pursuance of
                            appropriation made by law. And in his judgment the officers of State
                            would not be justified in paying, out any money upon a simple resolution
                            of the House or Senate,.unless there is same law to justify it. But now,
                            the bill that was passed making appropriations for Legislative expenses,
                            provides not only for the payment of the members of the two Houses, but
                            for such items as may be allowed by resolution of the two Houses. He
                            submitted then, that, under that act, it was competent for the House to
                            direct the payment of any claim coming properly under the head of
                            expenses of the Legislature; but if the item does not come properly
                            under the head of Legislative expenses, then a resolution can't, draw
                            money from the Treasury.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. The first appropriation bill appropriated $75,000 for the
                            per diem and expenses of members. We afterwards found $25,000 of claims
                            allowed and unpaid for expenses of the session of 1863, which we
                            incorporated into the general appropriation bill. Then from the
                            committee on claims came in an aggregate of $25.000 more. But if there
                            should be amongst these items anything not properly included in
                            Legislative expenses, there is no-appropriation for such items. Men with
                            such claims have no appropriation whatever; and even if the Specific
                            bill were passed, they could not be paid. As fast as claims were ordered
                            by the House they were entered on the journal of the Committee
                                on Ways and Means, and it was from that journal that we
                            made up the bill. It was the intention that all these claims should be
                            provided for in this $125,000.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. That appropriation having been made by law, the only purpose
                            of the specific bill is to specify the amount each claimant is to
                            receive. With the gentleman from Jefferson, he thought it competent for
                            the House to direct by resolution the manner in which these legislative
                            appropriations shall be paid. But without that bill, it would not the
                            competent for the House to do so. He submitted whether it would not be
                            better for the Judiciary committee, or its Chairman, to examine this
                            question. Appropriations having been made in the general bill for the
                            unpaid expenses of the Legislature of 1863, and for this session, and
                            the specific bill pointing out those to whom the items shall be paid
                            having failed,--let the committee report whether it is competent for the
                            House now to point out the manner in which these sums shall be paid. If
                            that can be done, then, the injustice arising from the failure of the
                            specific bill might, be provided for. I move to refer the resolution to
                            the Committee on the Judiciary, with instructions to
                            inquire and report whether it is competent for the House to direct by
                            resolution, the payment of current and past Legislative expenses out of
                            the general appropriations heretofore made for that purpose.
                        Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe suggested that the resolution be laid on the
                            table.
                        Mr. HARRISON understood that they had a similar resolution under
                            consideration in the Senate.
                        Mr. Buskirk's motion was agreed to, and so the resolution was referred,
                            Whereupon--
                        On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the several members of the Committee
                                on the Judiciary, had leave of absence to consider the
                            matter.
                    
                    
                        THANKS TO THE SPEAKER.
                        Mr. BECKETT moved to reconsider the vote of this day by which Mr. Boyd's
                            res-  [res]olution of thanks to the
                            Speaker of the House of Representatives was adopted.
                        Mr. SHUEY inquired whether the gentleman from Dubois (Mr. Beckett,) voted
                            in the affirmative on the adoption of that resolution.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. The Speaker himself has ruled that certain matters shall not
                            be inquired into.
                        Mr. MILLER of Tippecanoe. I move to lay the motion of the gentleman from
                            Dubois on the table.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. Which I hope will not be done. But I expect the vote will
                            show, that the friends are afraid to have the subject discussed.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is not debateable.
                        
                        Mr. DUNHAM demanded the yeas and nays which, being ordered and taken,
                            resulted--yeas 40, nays 16--no quorum voting.
                        Mr. DUNHAM demanded a call of the House which proceeded till a quorum was
                            determined.
                        Mr. GRIFFITH asked ineffectually to be excused from voting on this
                            question.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK desired to give the reasons for his vote.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. I object. The gentleman has no right to give his reasons.
                            It's a speech he wants. And if that is recognized as a right. I want to
                            make my speech.
                        Mr. BUSKIRK. The question is on laying the motion to reconsider on the
                            table. If that is not voted down, the next question will be on the
                            reconsideration.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER stated the order. 
                        Mr. BURWELL desired to give reasons for desiring to be excused from
                            voting. Under the twenty-seventh rule he claimed the right to make a
                            brief, verbal statement of these reasons.
                        The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentleman can give a brief statement.
                        Mr. BURWELL. I was not present at the time the resolution was adopted,
                            and did not vote upon it. I will not now speak of the manner in which
                            the Speaker has treated me, but I will ask simply to be excused from
                            voting one way or the other in any form on this question.
                        The House refused to excuse Mr. Burwell.
                        The yeas and nays being now taken on Mr. Miller's motion to lay Mr.
                            Beckett's motion to reconsider on the table, the result was--yeas 47,
                            nays 19--(the Speaker being present and not voting,) as follows :

                                        Scott, Thacher--19. 
                                
                            
                        
                        So the subject was laid on the table.
                    
                    
                         DAVID STEVENSON-- THE SPECIFIC BILL.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB (by consent.) from the Committee on the
                                Judiciary, submitted the following:
                        Mr. SPEAKER; The Committee on the Judiciary to whom
                            was referred a resolution of the House for the payment of David
                            Stevenson for statutes furnished to the members of the House under a
                            resolution thereof, with instructions to report whether the House can
                            legally direct by resolution the payment of it current expenses and of
                            the general appropriations heretofore made for that purpose, have had
                            the same under consideration, and instruct me to report, that inasmuch
                            as appropriations have been made by law for the payment of the expenses
                            of this General Assembly, it is competent for the House, by resolution
                            or otherwise, to direct to whom said payments are due and payable, and
                            to order them to be paid. And to effectuate such payments the committee
                            recommend the adoption of the following resolution:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That there be allowed and paid
                                        out of the general appropriation made for the payment of the
                                        expenses of the General Assembly of 1863, and of the present
                                        session, the several sums embraced in the specific
                                        appropriation bill which passed this House on the 4th inst.
                                        for the payment of the legislative expenses of the House for
                                        the sessions of 1863 and 1865, including all books
                                        stationery, newspapers, or other supplies furnished for the
                                        use of the House, and also all allowances for services
                                        rendered to the House or by its orders.
                                
                            
                        
                        Mr. BRANHAM submitted the following, which (by unanimous consent,) was
                            ordered to be included in the general order for the payment of
                            Legislative expenses:
                        SEC.--. That Samuel L. Rugg be allowed the sum of nine hundred and
                            eighty-one dollars and ten cents, for money expended for the office of
                            Superintendent of Public Instruction.
                        Mr. DUNHAM demanded the yeas and nays on the adoption of the resolution
                            reported from the Judiciary Committee.
                        Mr. WRIGHT proposed to amend by an additional resolution authorizing the
                            disbursing officers of the treasury to pay $25 to each of the members of
                            the Prison Committees for traveling expenses.
                        Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, insisted on including in this amendment the
                            several members of the Committee on Education. It was
                            agree to; and Mr. Wright's amendment as amended was also agreed to.
                        The question recurred on the adoption of the Committee resolution, as
                            amended ---Messrs. Dunham and Milroy having demanded the yeas and nays
                            thereon.
                        Messrs. COFFROTH, KILGORE and NEWCOMB, appealed to Mr. Dunham to withdraw
                            the demand for the yeas and nays-- Mr. Newcomb stating that a great
                            portion of these items were due to his democratic constituents.
                        Mr. DUNHAM. I am glad, that for the first time I have found the gentleman
                            advocating the rights of Democrats.
                        Mr. NEWCOMB suggested the difficulty about getting in these claims unless
                            thedemand for the yeas and nays were withdrawn. 
                        
                         Mr. DUNHAM (referring to Mr. Kilgore's appeal not heard at this desk.) I
                            am the most soft and yielding man in the world, sir. I withdraw the
                            demand for the yeas and nays.
                        The resolution as amended, was then adopted without a division.
                    
                    
                        DOORKEEPER OF COMMITTEES.
                        On motion by Mr. KILGORE, an order was adopted without a division,
                            allowing $65 to the Doorkeeper of the committee rooms of the House.
                    
                    
                        THANKS TO THE CLERKS.

                        Mr. WOODS moved to lay the resolution on the table.
                        Mr. BRANHAM. There is a rule which carries all such resolutions to the

                            debate.

                            service splitting wood. 
                        Mr. BRANHAM. I understand that this man is employed by the State
                            Librarian to take care of the House at a specified salary. The question
                            is whether we shall pay him extra or not. 
                        The order was rejected.

                            and report that His Excellency has no further communication to make to
                            this General Assembly.

                            Legislative business that can be done during the present regular session
                            of the General Assembly, is now ready to adjourn.
                    
                    
                        REPORTERS.
                        Mr. BURTON submitted the following:
                        
                            
                                
                                    Resolved, That the thanks of this House be
                                        tendered to Ariel Drapier and Charles P. Baymiller for the
                                        prompt and impartial manner in which they have reported the
                                        proceedings of this House during the present session.
                                
                            
                        
                        It was adopted. 
                        Mr. CHURCH moved that the House do now adjourn sine
                            die--but withheld the motion for the concluding message from the
                            Senate. 
                        On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB the House took a recess till 2 o'clock p.m.
                    
                    
                        AFTERNOON SESSION.
                        The House met at 2 o'clock p.m.

                        
                            BULWIG & KINDLER.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB submitted the following:
                            
                                
                                    
                                        Resolved, That Bulwig & Kindler be
                                            allowed the sum of fifty dollars for repairs to the
                                            Representative Halls, made in December 1862, but if the
                                            same is provided for in the specific appropriation bill,
                                            it shall not be paid.
                                    
                                
                            
                            Mr. BOYD. My recollection is that we have allowed that in the
                                specific bill. 
                            Mr. NEWCOMB. I make the exception, that if it is in the bill it shall
                                not be paid.
                            Mr. BURWELL. It is competent for the House to act upon new business
                                after the adoption of the resolution that the business of the
                                sessions is finished. The resolution was laid on the table.
                        
                        
                            LEGISLATIVE DAYS.
                            Mr. NEWCOMB asked and obtained leave to submit (without reading) a
                                very short report from the Select Committee on the Governor's
                                message, understood to be on the question whether Sunday is a
                                legislative day.
                        
                        
                            CALL OF THE HOUSE.
                            
                            
                            Mr. HAMRICK moved a call of the House, which was ordered and
                                proceeded in accordance with the custom of former sessions. The
                                clerk reported the following members present and answering to their
                                names, viz:
                            Messrs. Atkinson, Banta, Bonner, Boyd, Branham, Burwell, Buskirk,
                                Chambers, Church, Cook, Croan, Crook, Dunham, Emerson, Glazebrook,
                                Gregg, Gregory, of Montgomery, Gregory, of Warren, Griffith,
                                Hamrick, Harrison, Henricks, Higgins, Hogate, Howard, Hunt, Kilgore,
                                Lockhart, Lopp, Miller, of Tippecanoe, McVey, Newcomb, O'Brien,
                                Olleman, Osborn, Reese, Rhoads, Rice, Riford, Shoaff, of Jay, Shuey,
                                Sim, Stewart, Stuckey, Sullivan, of Scott, Trusler, Upson, Veach,
                                Welch, White, Woods, Wright, Mr. Speaker--53. 
                        
                        
                            MR. COX IS WEARY.
                            Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker. I rise to a privilege question. This has
                                been a long and arduous sessions. And, at the end of this long and
                                arduous session, Mr. Cox is weary,--and-- I ask that he be
                                excused.
                        
                        
                            ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE.
                            A formal message from the Senate announced that that body also had
                                completed the business of the session, and was now ready to
                                adjourn.
                            
                             Mr. BUSKIRK now submitted the motion, that the House adjourn without
                                day. The motion was agreed to. Before the result was formally
                                announced--
                            The SPEAKER said: Before putting the pending motion to adjourn. I ask
                                the indulgence of the House to repeat my grateful acknowledgments
                                for the honor done me in selecting me for this place of honor, for
                                the steady support it has given me in upholding its authority; and
                                now, for the courteous resolution in which it has expressed its
                                approval of my conduct. I have endeavored to requite your
                                confidence, by administering conscientiously and consistently, your
                                rules as they came from yourselves; nor, now, looking back upon what
                                has been decided, can I find an instance which my present deliberate
                                judgment does not approve.
                            We have reached the end of that term when, by the usage of this body,
                                it becomes my duty to declare it dissolved without day.
                                Notwithstanding the great importance of a few days more time, to
                                perfect measures of pressing public justice and necessity, and
                                notwithstanding my clear conviction that, as an original question,
                                the authors of the constitution meant only legislative days as
                                forming the session, in this, as in all other examples in which I
                                have maintained the usages of this House. I cannot here and should
                                not oppose myself to its deliberate judgment and authority so
                                uniformly expressed.
                            Our separation now, which breaks our common bond and fellowship of
                                public duty, has its necessary pain, but I find in it the pleasure
                                of being able to remember when I shall recall it hereafter, a manly,
                                public-spirited, and generous intercourse, which has strengthened
                                our regard for each other and our love for the public service. Such
                                will be my only reward of this general assembly.
                            It will, I hope be cherished alike by all of us. If there have been
                                gusts of feeling, we can charitably set them down to the best side
                                of the weaknesses of human nature, honest impulses, andean now
                                afford to forget them--to forget them all. Our public duties have
                                conceive our love of country, and love of public order, industry,
                                education, progress. We have, I think, done much that aftertimes
                                will gratefully preserve. Nor should our interest in these objects
                                abate, because our official labors seem ended, and we shall soon
                                pursue walks of private life. The task of private duty will then and
                                always be on us for duty is but another name for the allegiance we
                                owe to the eternal throne.
                            The question on Mr. Buskirk's motion to adjourn sine
                                    die was announced as decided in the affirmative by the
                                House of Representatives at precisely 3 o'clock p. m. So the House
                                adjourned, sine die.
                        

                        
                            Amendment of the Constitution of the United
                                States.
                            The following remarks were submitted on the joint resolution [S. 16.] accepting and
                                ratifying certain amendments to the Constitution of the United
                                States, proposed by Congress to the Legislatures of the several
                                states, [under an order of the Senate adopted Feb. 17.] and should
                                have appeared after the speeches printed on pages 277, 278, 279 and
                                280, of these Reports;
                             Mr. CULVER. Mr. President; It is probable that no Senator will be
                                called on in his official capacity to cast a vote more important
                                than the one now pending. The Constitution of the United States
                                tolerates slavery; the resolution now before us, so far as Indiana
                                is concerned is to prohibit it. We have the right to amend the
                                Constitution by a two-thirds vote of Congress, ratified by three
                                fourths of the States. What then is our duty ? Has slavery been a
                                curse or a blessing to our government ? We have been testing it more
                                than three-fourths of a century. What lessons have been taught us by
                                tolerating this great National Crime ? Has it not been at war with
                                the best interests of our country? Do not states and society suffer
                                by its withering influence wherever it exists ?
                            But there are still better reasons why slavery should be forever
                                prohibited by a constitutional amendment at this time. Are not its
                                friends and advocates to day trying to destroy our government ? It
                                would not submit that a majority of the people, as expressed through
                                the ballot box should rule it. The great doctrine of popular
                                rights--the heart and mainspring of our government, has been defied
                                and trampled on by the advocates of the "peculiar institution." War
                                with all its consequences and horrors has been brought upon us by
                                this evil. Millions of men have been marshalled in deadly conflict
                                in this great rebellion; mourning for dear and lost ones has been
                                heard all over the land. What men or what principles are responsible
                                for this desolating war among ourselves? Who commenced this "dance
                                of death!" Slavery and its advocates, is the only true answer. If
                                this crime is at the bottom of all our National trials and troubles
                                it is our duty to remove the cause.
                            God and right dictates to every honest man to vote a "free
                                constitution to a free people."

                                "such allowances as may be provided by either House or Senate by
                                resolution;" and for the per diem of officers of
                                the Assembly and their Assistants: the pages three dollars per day,

                            SEC. 322. A motion to postpone the trial on account of the absence of
                                evidence, can be made only upon affidavit showing the materiality of
                                the evidence expected to be obtained, and that due diligence has
                                been used to obtain it ; and where the evidence may be, and if it is
                                for an absent witness, the affidavit must show where the witness
                                resides, and the probability of procuring his testimony within a
                                reasonable time, and that his absence has not been procured by the
                                act or connivance of the party nor by others at his request, nor
                                with his knowledge and consent and what facts he believes the
                                witness will prove, and that he believes them to be true, and that
                                he is unable to prove such facts by any other witness, whose
                                testimony can be as readily procured. If thereupon the adverse party
                                will consent that on the trial the facts shall be taken as true, if
                                the absent evidence is written or documentary, and in case of a
                                witness, that he will testify to said facts as true, the trial shall
                                not be postponed for that cause; and in such case the party against
                                whom such evidence is used shall have the right to impeach such
                                absent witness as in case where the witness is present, or his
                                deposition is used. Senate Bill No. 14.AN ACT to amend an act

                                and by publication in a newspaper printed in said county, if any;
                                otherwise in the newspaper of any county in the State nearest
                                thereto. The sale shall be made by the Auditor at public auction at
                                the door of the Court House of the county in which the land is
                                situate, and the Treasurer shall take an account thereof; and each
                                of the said officers for making such sale shall receive a fee of one
                                dollar, to be paid by the purchaser.

                                interest for the residue for one year in advance, and the residue in

                                Auditor to the Superintendent of Public Instruction,SEC. 56. On
                                failure to pay such annual interest when it becomes due, the
                                contract shall become forfeited, and the land shall immediately
                                revert to the township and the Auditor and Treasurer shall proceed
                                forthwith again to sell the same in like manner, and on the terms
                                above specified; if on such second sate such land shall produce more
                                than sufficient to pay the sum owing therefor, with interest and
                                cost, and five per cent, damages, the residue shall, when collected,
                                be paid over to the first purchaser or his legal representative.

                                sale and revive the original contract.
                            SEC. 58. In ease of such forfeiture, the original purchaser may be
                                sued for waste or unnecessary injury done to such land.
                            SEC. 59. Such suit shall be prosecuted by the Auditor in the name of

                                remain unsold, the county Auditor may dispose of the same at private
                                sale, for the best price that can be had therfor, not being less
                                than the minimum price affixed thereto.
                            SEC. 61. After the expiration of the term of four years after any

                                the same manner that they would have been, had such lands not been
                                previously offered for sale; 
                                Provided however, That such appraised value shall
                                not be below the minimum price as now fixed by law.

                                records of the Board of County Commissioners shall be delivered to
                                the purchaser when he makes his first payment, and shall entitle him
                                to a deed when the terms of such purchase shall have been fully
                                complied with.

                                as above required, shall pay ten, per centum on the sum bid, to be
                                recovered by action before any court having jurisdiction, to be
                                prosecuted by the County Auditor in the name of the State, for the

                                be sold to satisfy the mortgage cannot be divided without materially
                                diminishing the value thereof, or if an in-lot or out-lot, be

                                or in-lot, for more than the amount of principal, interest, damage
                                and cost, the excess if any shall be paid to the mortgager,

                                have been appraised, shall be sold in like manner and  if upon sale of any such land a sum is
                                realized which is more than sufficient to pay the principal,
                                interest, damages and costs, the surplus shall be paid to the
                                original mortgager, his heirs or assigns, when collected.
