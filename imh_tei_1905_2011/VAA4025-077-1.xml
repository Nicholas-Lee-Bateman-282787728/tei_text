            <p>One of the fascinations that the American frontier has had for historians is that its history
                    reflects the full development of new societies and their cultures within a remarkably short span of
                    time. Even a place as seemingly prosaic as the agricultural frontier of the early Midwest offers
                    inviting examples to demonstrate the process of cultural development. In a classic discussion of the
                    subject, Frederick Jackson Turner used the metaphor of mingling fluids to describe the diverse
                    elements that made up the culture of the Midwest. "Into this province," he wrote,
                    "came tides of settlement that, in rapidity of flow and in variety of sources, brought a
                    new American society into existence."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Turner's examination of
                    the process emphasized the impact of the newness and social emptiness of the frontier. Although
                    acknowledging that the freshness of the society gave unusual opportunities for change and
                    innovation, later historians—influenced by more recent theories of social
                    science—have placed more stress upon the cultural traditions carried to the frontier by
                    its varied settlers.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>It is not difficult to identify the various sources from which the population and the culture of the
                    early Midwest were drawn, but to do so does not necessarily account for the product that resulted.
                    The question remains as to why one cultural trait brought into the wilderness survived and another
                    did not.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Some scholars have described the process as one of conflict and
                    competition between cultures, but the cultural scene that resulted is much too complex for such
                        oversimplification.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Accommodation as well as conflict seems to have played
                    a role.</p>
            <p>An examination of the settlement patterns of early-nineteenth-century Indiana places the problem of
                    cultural development in the Midwest in a more specific context. Moving northward from below the

                    </placeName> and its tributaries about the turn of the nineteenth century. Before the coming of the
                    railroad, access to water transportation was of great importance to these settlers, and they
                    followed the valleys of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        "the total legacy of past human behavior effective in the present, representing the
                        accumulation, through generations, of the artifacts, knowledges, beliefs and values by which men
                        deal with the world." Williams also notes that this accumulation has a normative
                        effect, giving individuals prescriptions for proper actions and behavior.</item>

                        made in a series of statistical analyses by Elfrieda Lang in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine

            <p>Given this pattern of migration, it might be expected that the Indianans' culture would
                    reflect almost exclusively the lifestyles of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and the upland South—the regions from which the majority of the early
                    settlers came. The character of the state's culture and society is not, however, so easily
                    described. In the process of settlement and development the residents of Indiana apparently made
                    cultural choices from among a number of available alternatives, many of them traceable to eastern
                    areas. To understand the distinctively Indiana culture which resulted it is necessary to look not
                    only at the variety of influences which compose it but also at the historical conditions in which
                    these influences were combined. Such a study may in turn provide insight into the unfolding process
                    of cultural development itself.</p>
            <p>Attempts both to identify the culture and to account for the development of it in a place like
                    frontier Indiana meet with considerable problems of evidence. The written records favored by
                    historians are limited in value for this purpose. Travelers through early Indiana usually followed
                    well-worn paths that did not always touch the developing regions of the state's interior;
                    rarely did such visitors comment on other than the obviously eccentric or unusual character traits.
                    Since the testimony of participants in a frontier society cannot be expected to be particularly
                    revealing about the general characteristics of the newly forming society, scholars must turn to
                    other types of evidence in an effort to understand the culture and its formation. Such evidence
                    could include traces of the early culture left on the physical landscape or relatively enduring
                    features which are embedded in the more recent culture but which seem to derive from the period of
                    cultural establishment. The evidence should emanate from the people as a whole, not merely from a
                    more literate or articulate elite.</p>
            <p>Various kinds of evidence fulfill such criteria; for example, physical remains such as folk
                    architecture and the folkways of tools, agricultural practice, and foodways. The most systematically
                    and abundantly collected evidence, however, is that provided by language. The linguistic atlas of
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in preparation for nearly a half-century, has produced a variety of materials useful

                    regions, and a variety of studies of specific localities and areas as well as a project for a
                    dictionary of regional language. The geographical patterns of dialect that emerge from these
                    materials can tell the historian something of the influence of various cultures in a given region,
                    and scholars, by combining the linguistic and the more traditional historical sources, can perhaps
                    reconstruct the cultural interactions that produce dialect variations in specific areas.</p>
            <p>Linguistic evidence that might yield clues about the cultural development of Indiana began to be
                    collected in the years just before World War II. It was quickly apparent that the picture was a
                    complex one. In 1940 Albert H. Marckwardt, who for many years directed the project for an atlas of
                    the North Central States, published some preliminary findings for Indiana. His comments were based
                    upon interviews with a few elderly informants born from the 1840s through the 1870s; they thus
                    reflected speech habits learned at a fairly early date. While various dialect influences were
                    apparent among the interviewees, Marckwardt detected southern speech patterns in areas much farther
                    to the north than in the neighboring states of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. He pointed out many specific traces of the dialect of the upland South, a dialect

                    confirmed Marckwardt's analysis, but it also became clear that the state's
                    adherence to South Midland speech was far from uniform. Researchers also found traces of the North
                    Midland dialect—a speech derived directly from the Middle States of the eastern
                    seaboard—though they failed to identify a regular pattern to its use. As late as 1957
                    Marckwardt pointed out that more attention had to be paid to the influences of <placeName>

                    were plotted on maps to delineate more clearly the similarities and differences of language. Two
                    conclusions emerged. First, the "Northern" dialect area—that which bore
                    the impress of the stream of migration from New <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Second, a hilly area at the extreme southern end of the state, a triangle bounded by a

                    approximately two thirds of the state. It is in "central Indiana" that the mixing

                    specific localities, and sometimes the same individual will use North Midland words for some things
                    and South Midland expressions for others.</p>
            <p>Linguistic scholars attempting to define dialect areas and to draw boundaries between them obviously
                    face difficulty when such mixing of language occurs; some have resorted merely to stating the
                    frequency with which competing forms are found in a given area. The varying conclusions drawn by
                    dialectologists when they attempt to define a "boundary" between the areas of
                    North and South Midland in Indiana demonstrate the linguistic confusion there. Where the line is
                    drawn depends on what is considered basic to the dialect. If <hi rend="i">you-all</hi> is considered
                    to be essential to South Midland speech, the boundary will lie rather far to the south; if certain
                    agricultural words are used as determinants, the line will be further to the north. In a widely used
                    basic analysis of American dialects, Raven I. McDavid, Jr., in 1958 placed the boundary line close
                    to the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                    Marckwardt. Marvin D. Carmony, however, argued for a line further south, one running approximately
                    through the center of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    characterized as South Midland; the great variety of mixed usage in the central part of the state
                    led him simply to characterize it as a broad "transitional area."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>An effort to understand the background of Indiana speech (and thereby perhaps to understand the
                    origin of the state's culture) might best begin by accepting Dakin's premise that
                    the establishment of a clear boundary between dialect areas is not possible. Instead of trying to
                    impose a pattern upon a picture of linguistic confusion, perhaps it is better to seek the source of
                    the confusion and the process which created it.</p>
            <p>The usual explanation for the North Midland-South Midland admixture in Indiana centers on the
                    subsequent intrusion of migrating Pennsylvanians into the area where upland southerners had come
                    earlier. The Pennsylvanians are usually described as migrating along the route of the National Road,
                    that great project of "internal improvement" that ran from western <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> This explanation, however, presents problems in that much of the
                    area in question in central Indiana had been rather fully settled before the National Road became a
                    very usable route for migrants. Although surveyed in the 1820s, the road was not fully completed
                    across Indiana until after the panic of 1837 brought a collapse of land sales and the end of
                    Indiana's land boom.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> For example, <placeName>

            <p>Given the widespread diffusion of this mixed language across much of central Indiana, another
                    hypothesis might be offered to explain it, namely, that the admixture accompanied many of the
                    earliest settlers, who brought with them a speech already influenced by a variety of dialects. A
                    closer study of the migration process offers some support to this explanation.</p>

            <p>If, instead of seeking to divide the region, linguists considered the area of central Indiana as a
                    whole to be characterized by a commonly held linguistic heterogeneity, a different perspective
                    emerges. Such an approach is encouraged by the fact that there are other cultural aspects that the
                    region has in common and that distinguish it from extreme northern Indiana on one hand and the hilly
                    area of southern Indiana on the other. Folklorists and geographers, who in recent years have
                    attempted to map distinguishing characteristics of the folk culture in ways similar to those of the
                    dialectologist, have provided data to illustrate this point of view. Like the dialectologists, they
                    have attempted to link the diffusion of folk-cultural patterns with the routes of migration into
                    successive regions.</p>
            <p>One area of study which offers significant cultural data is the pattern of diffusion of
                    folk-architectural types.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Attempts to chart the prevalence of various regional
                    styles of early architecture have reinforced the conclusions of the dialectologists in many
                    respects. There seems to be a clear consensus that the northernmost one or two tiers of Indiana
                    counties are culturally related to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and are different in their culture from the rest of the state. In addition, one
                    folklorist, Henry Glassie, describes the southern hilly portion of the state near the <geogName>Ohio
                        River</geogName> as an area included in the upland South.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Here some

                    of architectural types, where houses and barns of nearly every derivation can be found, in a pattern
                    that cannot be easily sorted out on any clear geographical basis.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

               <p>The two dotted lines indicate the boundaries of "material folk culture regions"
                        as described by the folklore scholar Henry Glassie. The northern end of the state was included
                        in a "northern" region; the southern tip was included in the cultural area of
                        the upland South. Glassie considered the region in between to fall in a midwestern culture
                        region. The dialectologist Robert F. Dakin drew a line almost exactly like Glassie's
                        southern one to indicate the northern limit of the South Midland dialect. A wide
                        "transitional area" of complex linguistic patterns lay between the South
                        Midland and North Midland dialects, according to Dakin; his northern boundary of that
                        transitional area is indicated by the cross-hatched line. Sources: Henry Glassie, <hi rend="i">Pattern in the Material Folk Culture of the Eastern <placeName>

                    a common religious composition. Attempts to map systematically the dominant religions of the area
                    reveal the prevalence of evangelical Protestantism; these maps also show a clear distinction between
                    the central area and the two extremes of the state.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Methodists have always
                    constituted the largest religious element in central Indiana, as indeed they have in much of the
                    lower Midwest. Perhaps more significant is the strong concentration of various branches of the
                    Christian or Disciples of Christ denomination, which seem to claim this area and adjacent parts of

                    persistent vitality of this group in Indiana down to the present helps to mark the region as

            <p>Since agriculture was basic to the settlement and growth of Indiana, any attempt to come to terms

                    is more characteristic of the central Indiana region than of the northern and southern ends of the
                    state.</p>
            <p>Cultural evidence in general, then, seems to support the idea that central Indiana can be regarded as
                    a fairly distinct cultural subarea, different in a number of respects from the northernmost part of
                    the state and also from the hilly region near the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Cultural characteristics of this subarea also extend westward beyond the
                    state's boundaries through much of central <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and can be found as well in the Miami Valley region of southwestern <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The culture represents an amalgamation of influences from both
                    the upland South and the Middle States, and both the basic agricultural way of life and the
                    prevalent religious culture suggest that the forces producing this amalgamation were at work at a
                    fairly early point in the region's history, possibly as early as the period around the War
                    of 1812. The line of cultural division between the central and southern regions of Indiana
                    approximates the line between the area settled after the War of 1812 and that settled before it,
                    which suggests that cultural variations may derive from the differing experiences of those two
                    migrations. Also, the evenness with which the mixed language characteristics of central Indiana are
                    spread across the region raises the hypothesis that some, at least, of these characteristics may
                    have been brought into the region by its early settlers. Finally, the cultural affinity with the
                    Miami Valley region in southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> suggests that that area may have played a special role in the cultural development of
                    central Indiana.</p>
            <p>Clues that point to the cultural importance of the earliest processes of settlement in Indiana
                    corroborate the maxims of linguists and cultural geographers as to the significance of the founding
                    period in the process of cultural development. Among dialectologists it is axiomatic that the

                    Those who arrive first get to call the cultural tune, and while no culture remains completely
                    static, it is relatively more difficult for latecomers, even in fairly large numbers, to displace
                    the earlier-established patterns. The geographer Wilbur Zelinsky has stated this idea more formally
                    as the "Doctrine of First Effective Settlement": "whenever an empty
                    territory undergoes settlement, or an earlier population is dislodged by invaders, the specific
                    characteristics of the first group able to effect a viable self-perpetuating society are of crucial
                    significance for the later social and cultural geography of the area, no matter how tiny the initial
                    band of settlers may have been."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Another geographer, Fred Kniffen,
                    has also pointed out the importance of what he calls "initial occupance."
                    According to Kniffen, "The concept is important because it recognizes the initial impact as
                    long-lasting, surviving even where a new ethnic stock has succeeded the original
                    settlers…. Further, initial occupance is the base of reference for all subsequent
                        change."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As noted earlier, the story of the "initial occupance" of central Indiana is
                    clouded due to the paucity of written historical evidence, a problem not uncommon to isolated

                    availability of social statistics of the modern sort. The census before 1850 was little more than a

            <p>Although historical source materials describing the early cultural development in Indiana are
                    difficult to find, it is not difficult to define the time period of "initial
                    occupance" during which the society of central Indiana was created. At the end of the War
                    of 1812 there were few organized settlements between the <geogName>White River</geogName> valleys
                    and the upper <placeName>

                    well-established society existed. Records of land sales in the region reflect this rapid
                    development. The opening of government land to purchase after the war brought sales to a
                    quarter-million acres annually by 1822. After slackening in the mid-1820s, sales revived later in
                    the decade and reached a volume of over a half-million acres annually in the early 1830s. The next
                    few years brought a speculative fever that increased land sales to a high of nearly
                    three-and-a-quarter-million acres in 1836; there followed a sharp drop in the panic year of 1837. By
                    that time most of the desirable land in central Indiana was in the hands of private owners.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

                    population. The availability of federal land, after 1800 purchasable in small tracts at favorable

                    areas of the Miami country naturally extended to the valley of the Whitewater, which emptied into

                    Indiana border in an area where it was easy to be tempted by the rich lands to the west still held
                    by the Indians. The Whitewater settlers reflected the same varied origins as those of the Miami

                    shopkeepers, the speech was more frequently that of the Middle Atlantic states. It was also of
                    far-reaching importance that these two cultures represented two different economic ways of life; the
                    independent farmer of the upland South, who had previously had fewer opportunities for commercial
                    agriculture, was meeting the northern businessman. The ways in which the two interacted in the
                    changing economic environment of the first three decades of the 1800s were greatly significant to
                    the future development of midwestern culture. Much has been written of the Middle West as a scene of
                    conflict between the upland southerner and the New Englander and of the resistance of the former to
                    the moralizing of the latter.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Perhaps more should be said of the interaction
                    between the southerner's way of life and the culture of the Middle States; in this
                    comparison historians might find—rather than an open clash—a mutual
                    collaboration induced by the economic opportunities of the time, a collaboration that might lend

                    the years through 1815 squatters continued to move into unoccupied lands when they felt the Indians
                    to be safely held at bay; if marketing a surplus was difficult, settlers could still revert to older

            <p>The social historian looking back on the years of the early nineteenth century can see the emergence
                    of a new <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> culture that was being created with surprising rapidity by
                    the forces of change. The evolving society took the independent farmer of the upland South and tied
                    him to a new world of commerce, in which by necessity he was linked to the entrepreneurial and
                    merchant classes of the new cities of the region. In this society the early stages of the
                    transformation of American agriculture from self-sufficiency to commercial farming, pointed out by
                    Richard Hofstadter in a perceptive essay over two decades ago, are apparent. The result of the
                    transformation, as Hofstadter saw it, was a typical American farmer with a "dual
                    character," one who saw himself ideologically as a self-sufficient yeoman like the southern
                    frontiersman yet behaved most of the time with the keen entrepreneurial sense of the northern

                        the commercialization of agriculture should not be characterized as a sharp change from
                        "subsistence" to "commercial" but as a progression through
                        increasing stages of commercialism. For discussion of this point of view see Clarence H. Danhof,

                    pressures and land prices rose in older regions. Some had spied out the choicest tracts in areas not

            <p>In the critical period from 1815 to 1830, growing markets, the technology of transportation, and past

                    agriculture, the corn-hog economy. The upland southerner had long relied on corn and hogs as the

                    themselves until slaughtered, and they too had become a mainstay of frontier life. As the southern

                    on the ability to slaughter and preserve pork for the distant markets developing in the South, the
                    East, and overseas as well. While a small trade in salt pork had existed before 1812 in the

                    the Miami country before 1812. The interaction demanded more of the farmer than of the businessman
                    in that to adjust to the new market economy the farmer had to adopt some of the

                    would be transformed by the new commercial environment. The farmer of the lower Midwest was now

                    social-cultural pattern was set. The constant concern in the interior regions of pre-Civil War
                    Indiana over the political issue of internal improvements reflects the poor transportation situation

                    of Barton Stone into a "Christian" church of particular strength in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> The evangelical tradition spawned by the revival also found a place in the
                    older Protestant sects, and a century later Robert and Helen Lynd would remark on the spirit of

            <p>Thus, both cultural and historical evidence point to the genesis of an <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> culture that was born in the Miami country just before the War of 1812 and took
                    root in the next two or three decades in much of central Indiana and the regions west of it. At this
                    stage in the study of regional cultural differences, it is virtually impossible to undertake a
                    complete analysis of this developing midwestern culture. One can perceive, however, old southern
                    pioneer traditions altering under the pressure of a modern commercial economy; a populace retaining
                    the upland southerner's spirit of independence, yet becoming more acutely sensitive to the
                    cycles of the economy; a society that retained its attachment to the farm as a center of family life
                    even as the farm became a link in the chain of commerce; and a people forming new religious
                    institutions upon a tradition of evangelical Protestantism. In short, the beginnings of the
                    corn-belt culture of the lower Midwest appear, a culture which would undergo still further
                    transformation as it spread further west to the edge of the Great Plains and was influenced by newer
                    factors such as the prairie environment, increased mechanization, and the coming of the railroad.</p>
            <p>The evolution of new cultural patterns as seen in this Indiana example reveals a process of

                    limestone and marble building Wilson repeated the presidential oath, then in a stirring inaugural
                    address proclaimed that the time had come to reform America's society.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    In the days that followed, Wilson and his "New Freedom" administration commanded
                    the front pages of the country's newspapers, and on March 11 the twenty-seventh president

                    many local areas, as large an amount of rain has fallen in an equal length of time, but never has
                    there been such a heavy rainfall over so large an area in so short a time"<hi rend="sup">7</hi> (see Figure 1).</p>
            <p>The result of so much rain over such a vast area in so little time was one of the most devastating
                    natural disasters in American history: the flood of 1913.</p>
            <p>Because of considerable rainfall in the previous days of March, the ground across the upper
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> watershed, as well as in other parts of the country, was
                    saturated when the heavy rain commenced on March 23 and thus could absorb little of the downpour.
                    For the same reason the rivers and streams of the upper <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> were well
                    up in their banks. In the first twenty-four hours of the rainstorn, accordingly, rivers and streams
                    in the upper <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> began to overflow. In the days and weeks ahead large

            <p>For railroad men, of course, nothing was quite so frightening as the prospect of a great flood; and
                    as murky water inched up the measuring gauges in the upper <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> and
                    spread across the countryside in the last days of March, 1913, they saw their worst fears come true.
                    The water smashed against bridges and fills, passed over mile after mile of track, and flooded
                    stations and storage facilities. It brought freight and passenger operations to a virtual
                    standstill. Indeed, if all the armies of Europe had invaded the upper <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> on March 23, 1913, it is doubtful that in the next week they could have wrought as

                    locomotive (almost certainly an Atlantic) at the head of the train. Leaning backward out the cab
                    window, the engineer was peering down the length of the train at the conductor preparatory to
                    getting underway. As the conductor raised his arm to signal the highball, operator Al Gossett rushed
                    out of the station waving his arms and shouting. Gossett had just received word that the floodwater

                    a tractive force of 25,000 pounds. By 1913 the 401—a small machine even by standards of

            <p>A few minutes before 11:00 p.m., after the last sandbags had been removed from the train, a decision
                    was made—probably by Stevens—to return to the sandpit. Stevens, Shaffer, and
                    McLemore climbed into the cab of the 401 while (one may assume) fireman Reason Jackson rammed his
                    scoop into the coal pile, opened the fire door, and heaved the black combustibles into the firebox.

                    backward, tugged gently at the three-car train. Riding alone in the first boxcar was Otto McClellan,
                    one of the shopmen who had been recruited to work on the fill. In the third car were twenty other
                    workmen, and standing on the footboard of the 401's tender was switchman Daniel Tucker.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>As the tender of the 401 approached Blue Hole, Gharst closed the throttle and set the brake. Stevens
                    wanted to talk with the bridge carpenter who had been observing the trestle. Because of the roar of
                    the water raging through the piles and timbers, conversation must not have been easy, but the
                    carpenter shouted that the structure was perfectly safe. The men in the cab of the 401 were not
                    entirely persuaded and agreed among themselves that this would be their last trip across the

                    Tucker clung to the grab rail on the tender above the footboard with one hand; a flickering lantern
                    must have dangled from the other. The eight driving wheels of the 401 began to turn. The beam from
                    the locomotive's backup light pierced the darkness and cast an eerie glow over the water
                    that was cascading through the trestle.</p>

            <p>First the tender moved onto the trestle. Tucker's eyes probably were fixed on the two
                    ribbons of steel that reached into the darkness and glistened in the yellowish glow of the
                    401's backup light. Because of the rushing water it is doubtful that he could have heard
                    the muffled exhaust of the locomotive. Next the driving wheels of the 401 passed on to the trestle,
                    and after that the spoked leading truck.</p>
            <p>Then it happened.</p>
            <p>Without warning—perhaps a preliminary sway—timbers began to split, pilings to
                    snap. The initial collapse of the Blue Hole trestle came at a point between the locomotive and the
                    tender, causing the two main components of the 401 to close like a jackknife. Before the tender
                    could smash into the wooden cab, Stevens leaped into the water. Still clinging to the grab rail
                    above the footboard, Tucker was hurled in the air, his feet above his head. As the locomotive
                    splashed into the water on the downstream side of the trestle, he continued to grip the rail. While
                    the water lashed at the remnants of the 284-foot trestle—it did not complete its conquest
                    until the next morning—the 401 slid from view, was carried some thirty feet downstream by
                    the current, and settled on its right side in more than twenty feet of water.</p>

                    the surface, and grabbed a piece of trestle timber that was floating downstream. Fearing that the
                    current was drawing him toward the main channel of <geogName>White River</geogName>, he let loose of
                    the timber and through the darkness swam to a drift of limbs and branches. The drift proved no
                    refuge, for the trainmaster again found himself being sucked beneath the water. Then, as he felt his
                    strength ebbing away, he was propelled back to the surface. At that point he glimpsed the outline of
                    a row of treetops protruding from the water. The treetops were adjacent to Hawkins Creek, more than
                    a half-mile south of the B&amp;OSW fill. He grabbed a limb, planted a foot in the crotch of a
                    small tree, and began to shout for help.</p>
            <p>Tucker meanwhile was waging his own struggle for survival. Still clinging to the 401's
                    tender, Tucker plunged into the swirling water headfirst, stayed with the tender until it hit
                    bottom, then struggled to the surface where he collided with a trestle timber. He grabbed the timber
                    and was floating downstream when another timber jarred him loose. He latched on to yet another
                    timber, only to be knocked loose a second time. After slipping several feet under the water, he made
                    his way back to the surface where he spotted a large flat object that was floating
                    nearby—possibly the door of a boxcar—and pulled himself atop it. Then, like
                    Stevens, he feared that the current was moving him toward the main channel of the river. Paddling
                    frantically with his hands, he managed to change the course of his conveyance and through the
                    darkness sighted treetops. Again like Stevens, he had reached the vicinity of Hawkins Creek. Wet and
                    cold, the shivering switchman grabbed a limb and climbed into a tree. He made voice contact with
                    Stevens, and the two men stepped up their cries for help.</p>
            <p>Hearing the cries, residents of Maysville organized search parties, moved out in small boats across
                    the flooded landscape, and some three hours after collapse of the trestle rescued Stevens and
                    Tucker. There were no signs of Shaffer, McLemore, Gharst, and Jackson.</p>

            <p>Back on the fill meanwhile another act of the Blue Hole drama had played out. When the 401 began its
                    plunge into the depths of the hole at a few minutes past 11:00 p.m., it remained coupled to the
                    first boxcar of the work train long enough to cause the car to overturn. Although one of its doors
                    may have broken loose and provided a raft for Tucker, the width of the fill at track level was
                    sufficient to prevent the car from tumbling into the water. Sparks from the stricken locomotive set
                    the car afire, and the resultant flames illumined the area around Blue Hole for the next two hours.
                    Fortunately the sole occupant of the car, Otto McClellan, escaped with minor injuries. The remaining
                    two cars of the work train stayed on the rails, and the twenty men in the last of those cars were
                    unscathed.</p>
            <p>As might be expected, the shock resulting from the demise of the 401 and the men in its cab sapped
                    the workmen on the fill of any incentive to continue the battle against the churning water. Collapse
                    of the Blue Hole trestle, moreover, had cut off the approximately seventy men toiling to the west of
                    the trestle from their supply of sandbags. The great overbearing concern of the men thus became to
                    get off the fill, the more so since many of them feared in the aftermath of what had happened to the
                    trestle that the entire embankment might now wash away. There seemed only one path of escape: along
                    the fill to the <geogName>White River</geogName> bridge and thence to the town of Wheatland two
                    miles beyond.</p>
            <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-077-1-055"/>
            <p>Thus, while Stevens and Tucker were awaiting rescue, the workmen on the fill, led by foreman John H.
                    Jackman, began to trek westward—destination, Wheatland. After proceeding a mile from the
                    dislocated <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Creek girder bridge, the men approached the two-span truss bridge over <geogName>White
                        River</geogName>. Jackman ordeied the men to halt. He explained that he wanted to inspect the
                    bridge before leading them across. Then, before the inspection could begin, the men heard the
                    ghastly sounds of twisting and snapping steel, cracking crossties, and finally a mighty roar and
                    crash. The relentless floodwater had claimed the <geogName>White River</geogName> bridge and
                    isolated the men, several of them terror-stricken, on the fill.</p>
            <p>Some of the workmen now pondered another avenue of escape. Five hundred yards east of the fallen
                    river bridge a switch track angled away from the B&amp;OSW main. It led to a grain elevator at
                    the foot of Tom's Hill, a rise some five hundred yards north of the fill. Although
                    completely surrounded by water, the hill was in no danger of being inundated. Equally enticing, the
                    residence of E. Ervin Padgett stood near the top of the hill, and the men could see the light of
                    kerosene lamps inside the house. A few feet from the turnout, to be sure, the switch track was under
                    water, and there was no way to ascertain how deep the water might be farther along. There was,
                    moreover, the matter of the water's current and also the blackness of the night.
                    Approximately half of the men concluded that the risk of trying to push through the water to
                    Tom's Hill outweighed that of staying on the fill and awaiting rescue. Thirty-two of their
                    co-workers, including eight black men from Wheatland, decided otherwise.</p>
            <p>And so the intrepid thirty-two, led by Jackman and Charles Denson, waded single file into the water.
                    Unable to see where they were walking, they relied on one of the submerged rails to guide their
                    steps. The water was cold and eventually reached the shoulders of the shorter men. Fortunately the
                    current presented no hazard, although the men stumbled repeatedly in holes between the rails of the
                    seldom-used switch. For perhaps thirty minutes they pressed on through the water until at last they
                    reached the hill, then scrambled up to the Padgett house and pounded on the front door. The Padgetts
                    welcomed the cold and drenched men, built a huge fire in the stone fireplace, and served hot coffee.
                    Meanwhile the telephone wire from the Padgett house was transmitting the news that all of the men
                    who had been working on the fill were safe, thus squelching a rumor that had swept <placeName>

                    a pile-driver was pushed from the shops to the hole where, despite the fearsome current, bridge

            <p>Meanwhile an almost continuous search for the bodies of the four men who had gone down with the 401
                    turned up nothing. Professional divers hired by the B&amp;OSW scanned the bottom of Blue Hole
                    and found no trace of the missing men. Then, on April 20, Raymond Leonard, walking with trainmaster
                    Stevens near Hawkins Creek (looking for the tree in which Stevens had found refuge on the night of
                    March 27), spied a piece of cloth protruding from the sand. A tug at the cloth exposed the
                    decomposed body of Reason Jackson. Indications were that Jackson had been crushed and scalded when
                    the 401's tender jackknifed into the wooden cab. Later that same day four boys were moving
                    about the area above Hawkins Creek looking for pools of water that might contain stranded fish when
                    one of the youths saw a hand protruding from the sand. It was the body of Clifford McLemore. On a
                    finger was a ring denoting the night yardmaster's membership in the Brotherhood of Railroad
                    Trainmen. Like Jackson, McLemore had died when the 401's tender smashed into the cab.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>The last scene of the Blue Hole drama played in the first days of June, 1913: the retrieval of the
                    401. Fortunately the locomotive had fallen into the comparatively shallow northwest corner of Blue
                    Hole and, when the flood passed, was lying in barely ten feet of water. At length, workmen lashed a
                    huge chain around the boiler and frame of the 401 and to the chain attached a long cable. Next they
                    pulled the cable far down the main track toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Creek and connected it to a pair of locomotives, probably Consolidations. After several
                    snappings of the cable, the churning driving wheels of the two locomotives dragged the cabless and
                    grimy hulk from the water and to the foot of the fill. From that point a wrecker was able to lift it
                    to the rails. The tender was never recovered. The locomotive was slowly pulled into the shops where
                    it was restored, given a new tender, and returned to service. Retirement of the venerable
                    Consolidation came twenty years later in 1933.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>In the large perspective of events in the upper <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> during the great
                    flood of 1913, the incident at Blue Hole trestle on the night of March 27 did not loom particularly
                    large. Disasters elsewhere in the region were far more devastating. The high water and resultant
                    fires that ravaged <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, for example, claimed ninety-six lives and gutted large

                    Blue Hole etched itself into the consciousness of the people of the surrounding
                    area—particularly into the consciousness of the men who operated trains across the
                        <geogName>White River</geogName> bottomland for the next half-century and beyond. Scarcely an
                    engineman or trainman who has rolled back and forth across the Blue Hole trestle (its timber and
                    pilings now sheathed with reinforced concrete and strengthened with rock ballast that protrudes
                    above the water's surface) from 1913 to the present has not known the main points of the
                    tragedy. It seems fair to say that from time to time some of them have peered down into the murky
                    water and pondered the fate of Gharst, Jackson, McLemore, and Shaffer. As Edward Hungerford wrote in

            <head>Indiana History in the Public Schools: A Symposium</head>
            <p>For more than a decade historians and educators have expressed concerns about the status of history
                    in the public schools, often lamenting its apparent "decline." For some, part of
                    the response has been to argue that state and community history offers large possibilities for
                    invigorating the teaching of history generally. Many argue also that state history is exciting and
                    important in and of itself—for teachers and students. In Indiana, where state history
                    once thrived, such concerns led to a session on teaching Indiana history at the sixty-second Indiana
                    History Conference, November 1, 1980. The two papers presented at the session are printed below,
                    largely as they were delivered. The first is by Errol <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Stevens, a Ph.D.-trained historian on the staff of the Indiana Historical Society. The
                    second is by Albert A. Hodge, a classroom teacher at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Consolidated High School. Following the two papers are commentaries by Pamela J.
                    Bennett, director, Indiana Historical Bureau; Jane Lowrie, Indiana State Department of Public
                    Instruction; and C. Frederick Risinger, coordinator for school social studies, Indiana University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Together these five people state the major problems and offer responses, perhaps solutions, to the
                    common objective of improving and expanding the teaching of Indiana history. While they do not
                    always share the same views, they agree that the challenges of teaching Indiana history should be
                    the concern of all interested in public schools and in history.</p>

            <p>In 1912 members of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution conducted an investigation into the
                    teaching of Indiana history in the public schools. They were distressed to learn that the Indiana
                    Department of Public Instruction had no systematic program in state history. The extent to which the
                    subject was taught at all depended on the enthusiasm and knowledge of the individual teacher.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The reason for this neglect was not so much because of a lack of interest but
                    because of a lack of materials. Herbert Briggs, one of the investigators from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> SAR and a tireless promoter of Indiana history in the schools, observed that
                    "an examination of the textbooks on <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history used in the schools of the state as far back as 1860 shows that in each book an
                    average of about six words were given to the state."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The absence of Indiana history from the curriculum disturbed not only Briggs and his compatriots but
                    also others who regarded a knowledge of state history an essential element in the training of a
                    loyal citizenry. Ben F. Stuart of Delphi put it this way: "What our State needs and must
                    have to exist, is an honest, patriotic and loyal citizenship. To attain this standard, the citizens
                    must have a knowledge of the history of the State. This knowledge is just as essential to patriotism
                    as a knowledge of the Bible is to Christianity, and you can not <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> teach
                    patriotism without teaching history any more than you can teach Christianity without teaching the
                        Bible."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> At the 1924 Indiana History Conference Mrs. Isadore Wilson
                    emphasized the morally uplifting aspects of state history: "'tis the moral effect
                    that is most wholesome. <placeName>

            <p>It was the celebration of Indiana's 100th anniversary in 1916 that gave the first big boost
                    to state and local history in the schools. In 1915 the General Assembly established the Indiana
                    Historical Commission, which was responsible for planning and carrying out the centennial
                        activities.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The commission, along with other friends of Indiana history,
                    took several steps to do something about the lack of materials. In 1916 the county centennial
                    chairmen of the commission persuaded the Indiana State Board of Education to approve an Indiana
                    history supplement to the regular American history textbook.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The Educational
                    Committee of the commission worked with the Department of Public Instruction to prepare an outline
                    for a course of study in Indiana history for grades one through eight. The department published this
                    outline in the <hi rend="i">Uniform Course of Study for the Elementary Schools</hi> for the
                    1916–1917 school year.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> As an aid to teachers the History Section of
                    the Indiana State Teachers' Association sponsored a volume entitled <hi rend="i">Readings
                        in Indiana History</hi>, published by Indiana University and distributed at reasonable cost.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In recognition of the importance of state history in the centennial year, the
                    superintendent of public instruction required all township and city institutes in the
                    1915–1916 school year to deal with some phase of Indiana history.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All of this activity did much to encourage the teaching of Indiana history, but much remained to be
                    done. In 1916 the historical commission reported that "an interest in Indiana and her
                    history has been awakened in all our educational institutions," <list type="footnotes">

                    lethargy and inactivity. But as a statewide system it was an incident rather than an integral and

            <p>In 1919 the Society of Indiana Pioneers called a special conference of all state agencies interested
                    in the study of Indiana history. This was the first annual Indiana History Conference. The meeting
                    reopened the question of the status of Indiana history in the schools by authorizing the president
                    of the Society of Indiana Pioneers to name a committee to approach the State Board of Education
                    concerning the teaching of the subject.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The committee made five
                    recommendations to the board, which, after some study, adopted all of them at its regular meeting on
                    February 13, 1920. First, the board agreed to divide the time devoted to history at the eighth grade
                    level between <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history, Indiana history, and local history. A study of the state government was to be
                    included in the course on Indiana history. Second, the board ordered the superintendent of public
                    instruction to distribute to the schools a list of questions on Indiana history. These questions
                    were to test the students' knowledge of Indiana history and to provide a basis for
                    promotion to the upper grades. All diplomas granted graduates from the common schools were to have
                    space alloted for credits in the study of state history. Third, the board agreed to continue the
                    special supplement on Indiana history when the American history textbook came up for adoption in
                        1921.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    and local history appointed by the president of the Society of Indiana Pioneers. Its "sole
                    purpose and function" was to "persuade city and town superintendents, county
                    superintendents of schools, township trustees, and teachers, and other persons to co-operate in an
                    effort to develop State and Local History."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus by 1920 a pattern had been established that would remain unchanged to the present time. When the
                    subject has been taught at all, Indiana history has normally been part of the junior high school
                    curriculum—either at the seventh or eighth grade level, but most commonly at the eighth.
                    The rationale for this was that since most students did not continue through high school in 1920,
                    the eighth grade was the best (and last) opportunity to teach them the subject.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One should not assume that students received a great deal of instruction in Indiana history simply
                    because the State Board of Education made the subject part of the eighth grade curriculum. It should
                    be noted that the board did not specify how much time was to be spent on Indiana history. Although
                    the <hi rend="i">Digest of State Courses of Study</hi> recommended that a semester be devoted to
                    Indiana history and civics, a school could spend a day, a week, or a semester on the subject and
                    still meet the board's directive.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The board did demand some
                    proficiency in Indiana history by making some knowledge of the subject a condition of graduation
                    from the common schools, but graduation from grade eight was soon to be a thing of the past in <list type="footnotes">

                    the junior high school system expanded, an eighth grade diploma became a meaningless formality. The
                        <hi rend="i">Administrative Handbook for Indiana High Schools</hi> for the year 1928 makes no
                    mention of graduation from grade eight.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> All that we can conclude, therefore,
                    is that by the early 1920s Indiana eighth grade students were getting some instruction in state
                    history. Exactly how much depended on the school and the teacher.</p>
            <p>I should mention here that during the 1920s and 1930s the state legislature passed two laws that
                    assured that at least some Indiana history—in very incomplete form—would be
                    taught in both the junior high and secondary schools. In 1925 the General Assembly required that all
                    schools, in grades six through twelve, "provide instruction in the constitutions of Indiana
                    and of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>." Ten years later it mandated all high schools to provide a required study of
                    "the historical, political, civic, sociological, economic and philosophical aspects of the

                    state constitution does not require much history, but the laws do provide an entering wedge, or at
                    least an excuse, for some instruction in Indiana history.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>From the 1920s to the present it is possible to trace the emphasis that the State Department of
                    Public Instruction has placed on the teaching of Indiana history through the various outlines of
                    courses that the department has published. Again, I must point out that these outlines are merely
                    recommendations to the schools as to what a course might contain. In practice there has been
                    considerable variation in the amount of time that a school may devote to the subject; therefore, the
                    outlines suggest more what the DPI wanted to see taught rather than what actually was taught.
                    Nevertheless, I think that we can assume that a large percentage of schools followed the
                    guidelines—if for no other reason than that it is the easiest thing to do.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1920s the State Department of Public Instruction continued to recommend that the
                    second semester of the eighth grade be devoted to "Indiana History and the state and
                    federal constitutions."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> In 1933 the department issued a <list type="footnotes">

                    history was still taught at the eighth grade, but the time to be spent on the subject was much
                    reduced. The eighth grade American history course was divided into fourteen units, each of which
                    focused on some aspect of social, economic, or political history. Indiana history was one of these
                    units, the title of which adequately describes its theme: "How Indiana Has Influenced and
                    Is Reflecting American Life." The unit drew inordinately on the state's early
                    period for illustrations and examples. It included material on the Old Northwest, pioneer life,
                    geography, transportation, urbanization, and Indiana's war
                        "achievements."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1946 the State Department of Public Instruction announced a second revision of the social studies
                        curriculum.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The authors of the new program, the General Committee on
                    Social Studies, believed that several important developments in American society had made revision
                    of the curriculum necessary. "Society is dynamic," the report observed,
                        "<hi rend="i">ergo</hi>—the school curriculum, which reflects the
                    aspirations and highest ideals of society, cannot be static." The report listed the most
                    important societal changes as industrialization, urbanization, changes in family life, changes in
                    attitudes toward race and religion, the increase in school enrollments, and "the force of
                    recent events"—an obvious reference to America's role in World War II.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How did state and local history fit into the new program? The committee accepted the principle that
                    children's consciousness expanded outward from their immediate surroundings—
                    home, school, neighborhood—to the larger world—community, state, nation,
                    world. The course of study was designed to reinforce this natural progression. Local and state
                    history, therefore, was concentrated—much as it is today—in the earlier
                    grades, but the authors of the program were careful to emphasize that the study of local and state
                    history should not be "limited to the first three or four grades." Local examples
                    were to be utilized whenever possible to illustrate national and world trends. "There is no
                    terminus for the study of Indiana," the authors of the program stressed. "The

                    new program demoted Indiana history from grade eight to grade seven. One of the objectives of the
                    seventh grade American history course was to "gain an understanding of the important role
                    that the state of Indiana has played, and is still playing, in the history and economy of our
                    nation." The new course of study also recommended that Indiana history be offered as a
                    one-semester elective at grades eleven or twelve.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the late 1940s and early 1950s Indiana history was clearly on the wane. The 1954 <hi rend="i">Digest of Courses of Study</hi> barely mentioned the subject at all.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In
                    that year the Schools Committee of the Indiana Historical Society became concerned enough to try to
                    do something about the decline. The committee sponsored the preparation of teaching units, put
                    together packets of material on Indiana history, and made them available to school libraries and
                    history teachers. It also lobbied for legislation requiring that Indiana history be taught in the
                    secondary schools—an effort which came to nothing. In an attempt to determine just how
                    widely the subject was taught, the committee sent approximately one thousand questionnaires to the
                    state's public and private schools. Eighty-five percent of the 348 forms returned reported
                    at least some instruction in Indiana history. The subject was most commonly taught at the eighth
                    grade level. Probably the most revealing finding was that the subject was more popular in the
                    smaller rural schools than in the larger urban ones. State history apparently had the greatest
                    appeal in those schools that had the most traditional curricula and that were least susceptible to
                    new trends in the social studies.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    new course in "Area Studies of the Non-West" was instituted at grade seven. The
                    State Department of Public Instruction recommended that Indiana history be integrated into the
                    American history course to be offered at grade eight. The Commission on General Education also
                    approved Indiana history as an elective on the secondary level.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At about the same time other efforts were underway to improve the teaching of Indiana history. In
                    1961 Superintendent Wilson, himself an Indiana history buff, issued a <hi rend="i">Handbook on
                        Indiana History</hi> to assist teachers in preparing courses. At its 1964 convention the Indiana
                    Junior Historical Society passed the first in a series of resolutions calling for legislation that
                    would make Indiana history a required subject in the secondary schools. In 1967 such a bill passed
                    the Indiana House of Representatives but died in the Senate education committee.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There have been no major revisions of the social studies curriculum since 1965, although course
                    offerings have been modified in response to changing needs. Increasing emphasis has been placed on
                    the racial and ethnic diversity of America and on the importance of a global perspective in an
                    increasingly shrinking world. These changes have not favored the teaching of Indiana history. Until
                    1979 the list of approved electives for the social studies included numerous interdisciplinary
                    courses in Asian studies, African studies, current problems, and ethnic studies, but nothing in
                    Indiana history. (The Indiana history elective approved in 1965 was apparently dropped sometime
                    shortly afterward.) There is no question that the teaching of Indiana history has been on the wane
                    since the late 1960s. One explanation for this decline is that the subject has been crowded out of
                    the curriculum by interdisciplinary offerings. A second and probably more pertinent explanation is

            </p>
            <p>A bright spot on the horizon is the new course in Indiana studies which the Commission on General
                    Education approved in 1979. This course is a secondary-level elective described as an
                    "integrated program comparing and contrasting the nation's development with that
                    of Indiana" in the areas of "politics, economics, and history." It
                    utilizes history "as a basis for understanding current policies and practices to aid the
                    student in examining local government in action, follow state legislative procedures and be
                    motivated to participate in political action as a concerned citizen."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                    The State Department of Public Instruction designed the course to meet the requirements of the 1935
                    state law that mandated a study of the state and federal constitutions covering the
                    "historical, political, civic, sociological, economic and philosophical aspects of the
                        subjects."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> How such a course might operate in practice depends on
                    how the State Department of Public Instruction and the individual teacher interpret the law. If the
                    course focuses on government and the processes of government, it may well leave out much that is
                    essential for an understanding of how Indiana has developed. Because of this uncertainty, I feel
                    that the course should not be viewed as a substitute for a traditional course in Indiana history,
                    but as a supplement.</p>
            <p>Should we be satisfied with the place of Indiana history in the schools today? To answer this
                    question properly one must view the subject within the context of the social studies program in
                    general. Since World War II the social studies have increasingly emphasized the importance of a
                    world view in understanding American society. The State Department of Public Instruction's
                    social studies curriculum development guide stresses that American culture must be understood
                    "within the context of a treatment of other cultures, societies and nations, for the
                    reality is the growing interdependence between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and all other nations."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> I think that this is a healthy
                    trend, but I submit that there is a tension between this global perspective and the study of local
                        history.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-077-1-072"/> Some champions of local history have gone so far as to condemn
                    the study of the history of other countries. Ben F. Stuart said in 1922 that the study of Indiana
                    history was superior to "a life study of all the debauched and corrupt monarchs and rotten
                    monarchies of the old world. Hence I would eliminate much of the latter and substitute the
                        former."<hi rend="sup">36</hi> But most have rejected this untenable position and have
                    argued instead that while the study of other cultures was important, the study of state and local
                    history was essential. In 1916 the report of the Indiana Historical Commission noted that whatever
                    "an individual's knowledge of the world and in history in general, his education
                    and culture cannot in any wise be called complete unless he knows his own State and immediate
                    community, the past out of which they have developed, and the present which so vitally affects him
                    and his neighbors."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> More recently, Donald F. Carmony recognized the
                    "need for increased study of other countries" but emphasized that "both
                    children and adults need increased knowledge and understanding of the history of their own state and
                    country. Persons who lack such information and understanding are inadequately informed citizens of
                    their state and country, no matter how informed they may be about other areas of the
                        world."<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>Despite the tension between them, global studies and local studies are not mutally exclusive, but
                    complementary. We need to show students how events in distant parts of the globe can have a direct
                    impact on how we live in Indiana. We also need to show them how our own historical experience has
                    conditioned our responses to these larger events. The challenge, therefore, is to find the proper
                    balance between global and local studies so that they reinforce one another.</p>
            <p>A second trend in the social studies is the realization that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is a pluralistic society, not only in terms of the ethnic and racial backgrounds of
                    individual Americans but in terms of values. The new social studies recognizes that conflict and
                    diversity are normal parts of American society. This has not been the case with state and local
                    history as traditionally taught or written. Indiana history has been the domain of the white
                    Anglo-Saxon Protestant, and its subject matter has been drawn primarily from the frontier period of
                    our state when its population was, in fact, nearly homogeneous. Until recently, very little
                    attention has been given to blacks and <list type="footnotes">

                    recognition that different groups of Hoosiers have followed different value systems. Those who
                    championed local history at the beginning of the century knew what they believed in and saw local
                    history as a means of teaching important moral lessons. They emphasized the qualities which they
                    thought they saw in the early frontiersmen—courage, resourcefulness, individualism,
                    devotion to the family, and belief in Protestant Christianity.</p>
            <p>Teachers of local history must recognize that America is a diverse society and rise above the
                    provincialism that has characterized the subject. The study of racial, ethnic, and religious
                    minorities must be integrated into state and local history. Teachers should also realize that
                    Indiana history did not end with the Civil War. In correcting this image of America as a homogeneous
                    society, we should be careful to avoid creating the illusion of a fragmented society. We do not want
                    to trade courses full of WASP trivia for courses full of ethnic trivia. There is the danger of
                    opening new horizons of provincialism. Local history must show how these disparate elements of our
                    society have come together to make a nation.</p>
            <p>State and local history's greatest value comes when it shows how local events fit into the
                    whole. Local history is a kind of "case study" of the larger forces that are at
                    work in American society. One commentator advocated the study of Indiana in these words:
                    "It is as though some great eye had scanned American history and had plucked a sampling
                    from each era and episode, placed it in a neat little bundle, and called it ‘Indiana
                    History.’ To open that bundle is to plug the water melon [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] of
                    American history; its [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] like tasting the cake, or sampling the
                        wine."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In other words, local history helps us Find the universal
                    in the specific.</p>
            <p>The study of state and local history can also make concrete what might otherwise seem hopelessly
                    abstract to the student. The <hi rend="i">Uniform Course of Study for the Elementary Schools,
                        1914–15</hi> puts it this way: "The study of local history is important
                    … because such study helps to make all history real."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> We
                    can think of state history as a kind of laboratory course. In every community there are physical
                    legacies from the past that can be used to illustrate larger historical topics. The question is
                    whether or not teachers have enough knowledge, or energy, to make use of them.</p>

            <p>How should state history fit into the curriculum? First, it should be integrated wherever appropriate
                    into other course offerings to illustrate local manifestations of larger trends. I refer not only to
                    the traditional American history courses but to other disciplines such as economics, sociology, and
                    government. Second, as a separate course Indiana history should be taught <hi rend="i">after</hi>
                    the students have a firm grounding in American history. The proper place for such a course,
                    therefore, is in the senior high school, not in the eighth grade. Students must understand the
                    larger forces at work in the world before they can appreciate their impact on the state or their
                    communities. Otherwise, courses in local history are reduced to exercises in trivia.</p>
            <p>We do not need any great changes in the curriculum to accomplish these goals. I would like to see a
                    secondary-level elective in Indiana history added to the social studies program; in the meantime we
                    can make do with the new course in Indiana studies. The real obstacle that we must overcome is the
                    lack of good Indiana history materials for both teachers and students. As Herbert Briggs pointed out
                    in 1919, teachers "are willing to teach those things that are available but few persons in
                    the public schools have an opportunity to spend several hours in organizing facts."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> We cannot ask teachers to integrate state history into their courses and
                    teach a new one in Indiana studies unless they have the means to do it. The challenge before us
                    today is the production of new textbooks and supplementary materials in Indiana history.</p>

                    most students, and more significantly most teachers, know about Hoosier heritage and history.
                    Perhaps I was naive about the status of state history education twenty years ago. As I reflect on
                    it, DePauw University, my alma mater, did not offer Indiana history, and I picked up a class one
                    summer at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. By the way, it was at that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> class that I met Robert W. Montgomery, then director of the Indiana Junior Historical
                    Society, an event which had considerable ramifications. But I suppose that is another story.</p>
            <p>This paper is an outgrowth of a presupposition that having the opportunity to learn about
                    one's local and state history is a desirable opportunity for junior high and high school
                    students. I am keenly aware that the curricula of most high schools are so extensive that many
                    college-preparatory students do not have time in their schedules for classes they would like to
                    take. In the recent past in preparing for this paper, I have had discussions with some outstanding
                    authorities in the field of Indiana history who see a need for making a class in Indiana history a
                    requirement for graduation in our state. My contention is that an elective offering is preferable to
                    a required course. My reasoning is that social studies requirements in Indiana are already
                    extensive; so I am assuming that if state history were required, it would be at the expense of a
                    currently required social studies class. I also believe, after fifteen years of teaching, that
                    forcing students to be in classes they do not want to take is usually counterproductive, isolated
                    contradictory examples notwithstanding. I believe in the old cliche about leading a horse to water.
                    It has also been my experience that if a class is well taught by an enthusiastic teacher who is
                    conscious of keeping the course meaningful to the students and "selling" students
                    on the worth of the class, then enrollment will be stable or growing. When we have had classes fail
                    in our department at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School, it has been the outgrowth of dull teaching or failure to establish
                    relevance. I do think that it would be much more productive to work toward the restoration of a full
                    semester of Indiana history at the eighth grade level.</p>
            <p>As you know, state history is now presented at the fourth grade level. While I am not an elementary
                    teacher, I have been invited on several occasions to speak to fourth grade classes. I honestly
                    question if any teacher can present several of the most significant topics in Indiana history at a
                    meaningful level to fourth graders. If you doubt my judgment on this, I challenge you to go talk
                    about Utopian socialism, the millennium, and <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-077-1-076"/> celibate communal

                    </placeName> in a fourth grade classroom.</p>
            <p>There are several schools that do still present at least a six-to-nine-week unit on Indiana history
                    at the junior high level. One of the major points of this paper is to assert that before the Indiana
                    State Department of Public Instruction or the Indiana General Assembly is pushed to restore a
                    significant junior high state history requirement or to establish a high school course, attention
                    and money must be given to the development of a text and audiovisual materials as well as to the
                    training of teachers for Indiana history.</p>
            <p>Before turning to training and materials <hi rend="i">per se</hi>, we should consider another point.
                    In the past twenty years while the teaching of state and local history has been declining in the
                    classroom, there has been a concomitant mushrooming of interest in extracurricular activities
                    through the History Day competitions and the Indiana Junior Historical Society. Currently, these
                    activities are being directed through the Indiana Historical Bureau as a part of its responsibility
                    to support education in Indiana history. It seems that now we are considering how we can reestablish
                    Indiana history in the classroom with the same verve and success it enjoys outside the classroom.
                    The motto of the Indiana Junior Historical Society is "History Is Fun." I would
                    submit that with a well-structured set of materials and with well-trained, enthusiastic teachers, an
                    elective high school class in Indiana history can and should be fun.</p>
            <p>At <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School we instituted an elective one-semester class in Indiana history eight or
                    nine years ago. The class is open to any student, freshman through senior, but is aimed for average
                    to below-average students. If you have been wondering about that, our thinking was that most
                    college-preparatory kids were not looking for more alternatives while our offerings for noncollege
                    kids were very thin. It is interesting to note that most students who take Indiana history are not
                    people who belong to our history club. It was our intention to obtain junior high level texts to use
                    in this class. We quickly learned that no such books were available. Even Hubert H. Hawkins, then
                    director of the Indiana Historical Bureau, was unable to find us a set of texts. We could not even
                    get a set of used books. In the interim, Hawkins supplied a variety of materials published by the
                    bureau and a classroom set of readings in Indiana history. Finally we bought a set of William E.
                    Wilson's <hi rend="i">Indiana: A History</hi> from the Indiana University Press (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1966). The book was never intended as a text and is not satisfactory for classroom
                    use. Our program has <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-077-1-077"/> endured from the first through the efforts
                    of the teachers who have taught it.</p>
            <p>As alluded to earlier, one of the most basic needs for a worthwhile statewide program of teaching
                    Indiana history at the secondary level is the training of teachers. At one time Indiana colleges and
                    universities were forced to offer a class in Indiana history because teachers must have had the
                    class to get a certificate to teach history here. Today many of the private colleges and
                    universities no longer offer a state history class. Before much can be done in the public school
                    classrooms, we must return to training history teachers in Indiana history. Very few Hoosier history
                    teachers under the age of forty have any background in state history from their college training. In
                    turn, one might then consider the need for an updated college level text beyond John D. Barnhart and
                    Donald F. Carmony, <hi rend="i">Indiana: From Frontier to Industrial Commonwealth</hi> (<placeName>

                    </placeName>, 1954). But that is another topic, I suppose.</p>
            <p>Of more immediate concern to this paper is the crying need for text materials at both the high school
                    and junior high levels. Beyond Carmony's <hi rend="i">Brief History of Indiana</hi> (64
                    pages) from the Indiana Historical Bureau or <hi rend="i">Here Is Your Indiana Government</hi>
                    published periodically by the Indiana State Chamber of Commerce, I am not aware of any textbook for
                    Indiana history still in print for use above the fourth grade. It seems very unlikely that any
                    commercial publisher of textbooks will prepare an Indiana history text. By the standards of modern
                    publishing we constitute far too small a market to be profitable. Thus, some Hoosier agency, the
                    Historical Society, the Historical Bureau, the Indiana Committee for the Humanities, the Indiana
                    Council for the Social Studies, or one of the state universities will almost certainly need to
                    subsidize the publication.</p>
            <p>Last year a grant was given by the Lilly Endowment to the Indiana Council for the Social Studies to
                    begin work on a new text. Under the leadership of C. Fred Risinger, coordinator for school social
                    studies, Indiana University, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a committee of real-live classroom teachers was selected from around the state to work
                    for several weeks in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the initial draft of a new text in Indiana studies. Their approach varies from the
                    traditional history book in a couple of significant ways. First, there is an emphasis on political
                    and governmental information. The intent here is an intertwining of history and information about
                    current state government. In other words, this new book might serve as a history text and as a
                    substitute for the Chamber of Commerce's <hi rend="i">Here Is Your Indiana</hi>
                    <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-077-1-078"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Government.</hi> This governmental emphasis was, at least in part, a reaction to a bill
                    from the General Assembly a few years ago supporting an elective, high school class in Indiana
                    studies.</p>
            <p>A second unique characteristic of the ICSS project is the inclusion of many student activities, built
                    into the text. As Risinger pointed out when he presented a sample of the project to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> social studies teachers, the format is intended to keep students active participants in
                    the learning process, a point where many history and government texts fail.</p>
            <p>A third feature of this new effort, which we liked in the sample we saw, was a first-person
                    fictionalized account through the eyes of a young person. These segments, I understand, would appear
                    throughout the text for different time periods. It is hoped that these first-person accounts can
                    arouse the same sort of student interest as actual oral history accounts do of recent historical
                    events. Another feature which we liked is that much attention is given to recent events and to
                    profiles of famous Hoosiers, but these same features will make it necessary to update the text every
                    few years. Nothing turns kids off more than working with outdated material, even in history.</p>
            <p>While I have read only a fragmentary sample of this new Indiana studies material, I found it
                    interesting to read and clearly a step in the right direction. I am certain that purists in Indiana
                    history will find fault with the political-governmental emphasis, and they will have a valid point.
                    I am sure that Risinger and the teachers who worked on the project would agree that this is not a
                    perfect, definitive text. But as a classroom teacher, I would be quick to point out that this
                    material has to be better than what we have now since we have nothing now. I would strongly
                    recommend to the Committee for the Social Studies that both the Indiana Historical Society and the
                    Indiana Historical Bureau be given a full text of the work and asked for their input before a final
                    edition is locked in. It would be sad indeed if such a well-intentioned project failed to utilize
                    the resources and expertise of any and all groups concerned with improving the teaching of our
                    Hoosier history. I would also counsel both the society and the bureau to be as positive and
                    supportive as possible in cooperating with Risinger's group since its work is at the very
                    least a good starting point. At this point, when those of us out in the classrooms have no text
                    material to work with, we do not want to see groups with a similarly honest desire to meet our need
                    competing instead of cooperating. I am hopeful that we will be able to use the material on a trial
                    run in our <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School Indiana <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-077-1-079"/> history class in 1981. At any
                    rate, it is safe to say that all the groups are aware of the need for a new text and want to see the
                    need met.</p>
            <p>Another suggestion discussed by those of us on the long-range planning and development committee of
                    the Indiana Historical Society is a one-volume condensation or summation of the society's
                    multivolume history of the state. Obviously the first major obstacle to overcome with that idea is
                    for the remaining two volumes in the original project to be completed. A one-volume compilation
                    would be excellent for better high school students and for the much needed college-level classes,
                    but in my opinion it should not be set up as a text book <hi rend="i">per se</hi>, with review
                    questions at the end of each chapter and rigidly outlined structure.</p>
            <p>A third concept for a publication that I think would be a boon in teaching state and local history
                    would be a book of reprints of selected articles from the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History.</hi> I propose that such a book should be set up to follow chronological teaching units and
                    be part of an overall package with review material, tests, and activities program. It might be that
                    this volume of reprints could serve as "outside reading" to accompany the text
                    from the Committee for the Social Studies to balance its governmental emphasis, making a
                    well-rounded set and partially relieving the historical purists' doubts about the
                    "Indiana studies" approach. It seems to me that a committee made up of Indiana
                    Historical Society staff members along with someone from the Indiana Historical Bureau and classroom
                    teachers could select, edit, and tie together such a set of articles from the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> in a relatively short time. Certainly this approach would be more
                    expedient than an entirely original work for classroom use.</p>
            <p>The final item of concern I have on this topic of what we need if we are to do a creditable job of
                    teaching Indiana history is that any printed material be accompanied by a coordinated package of
                    supplementary materials. People who do not teach may not realize how important supplementary
                    packages such as student activity projects, tests, vocabulary lists, and review summaries are or how
                    often they make the difference in which text is selected for purchase. My thinking here is that even
                    in fairly large schools Indiana history is not likely to be a full-time teaching assignment. In most
                    cases a teacher is not going to have more than one or two sections of it a day out of five or six he
                    is teaching. Thus, he cannot or will not give it an extensive amount of preparation time outside of
                    class. Unless the teacher has a good background already, he is likely to rely <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-077-1-080"/> very heavily on the "package" to know something more
                    than the students who have the text. It may well be that a publication of suggested student projects
                    and activities could be compiled fairly easily from the activities and projects conducted over the
                    years by the history clubs. Reports of these activities are submitted annually to the Indiana Junior
                    Historical Society and are on file in their state office.</p>
            <p>Of much greater value than any printed supplementary materials, however, would be the creation of a
                    set of audiovisual materials to accompany any class in Indiana history. During the years I have
                    taught, undoubtedly the greatest change in education has been the utilization by classroom teachers
                    of video-taped television programs. My feeling is that a videotape does not have to be terribly good
                    to show kids more than I can with a traditional lecture format. At its best a series of videotapes
                    could do for Indiana what Alistaire Cooke's <hi rend="i">America</hi> series did for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history. To be worthwhile such a series of tapes would have to be done professionally
                    by a team of teachers, historians, and technicians. I most certainly am not espousing a set of
                    recordings of someone else using a traditional lecture method. I intend the programs to show
                    locations and artifacts a great majority of the time. You will notice that I have said videotapes,
                    not movies. If you are not familiar with the current situation in audiovisual materials, let me
                    assure you that the video casette is easier to use, familiar now to almost all teachers, and most
                    importantly, a great deal less expensive than sixteen millimeter films to produce. Movies have
                    become terribly expensive even to rent for classroom use. There are a couple of acceptable
                    alternatives to videotape which would be even less expensive. These would be automated sound
                    filmstrips or slide-tape combinations.</p>
            <p>Any number of local, amateur audiovisual productions in Indiana history have been produced by history
                    clubs, county historical societies, and teachers over the years. While most of them are of a subject
                    matter and quality which probably would limit them to local consumption, they would at least suggest
                    many areas of interest for a professionally written and produced series. A few professionally made
                    programs such as "The Guns of September" from Hook's Drugs on
                    Indiana's role in the Civil War may be ready now to be incorporated into an overall program
                    series. It might well be that the Indiana Historical Society should undertake the production of a
                    series of sound filmstrips, videotapes, or slide-tape programs based on their own publications.
                    These could be supplied to county or local historical societies as well as to schools; and I cannot
                    imagine <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-077-1-081"/> anyone teaching Indiana history not wanting color-sound
                    programs like <hi rend="i">The House of the Singing Winds, From Paddle Wheels to Propellers, Indiana
                        Houses of the Nineteenth Century, Alloys and Automobiles, <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName> from Our Old Corner</hi>, or the <hi rend="i">Walam Olum</hi> to show to his
                    students. And of course there could be programs on the diaries of Calvin Fletcher that would take a
                    student's entire high school career to see.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, as a history teacher and department chairman, I can attest to the dearth of both
                    teachers and materials for state and local history above the fourth grade level. I am confident,
                    based on the successes of History Day projects and the history clubs, that with good materials,
                    presented enthusiastically by a well-trained teacher, student interest will be generated and be
                    reflected in student enrollment in elective high school Hoosier history or Indiana studies classes.
                    What remains to be seen is whether the Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana Council for the
                    Social Studies, the Indiana Historical Bureau, and any other groups who recognize the legitimacy of
                    the need can work together to produce meaningful changes in teacher training and in instructional
                    materials.</p>
            <p>How important is it that we reach the students in our schools with the story of their Hoosier
                    heritage? How important is it that we reverse the commonly held adolescent view that Indiana is a
                    place to move away from as quickly as you are old enough? How important is it that students
                    recognize that we did not come to be what we are and to have what we have just by accident? Who
                    cares enough to replace good intentions with action? Who cares?</p>
            <p rend="center">Comment by Pamela J. Bennett<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both Errol W. Stevens and Albert A. Hodge call for materials for teaching state and local history as
                    a first step in getting Indiana history in the secondary school curriculum; Hodge issues a challenge
                    to the Indiana Historical Society and the Indiana Historical Bureau to produce such materials. Since
                    space has been limited, I will confine my comments to that challenge.</p>
            <p>What seems obvious from Stevens's historical examination and from my own experience over the
                    past few years is that one <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-077-1-082"/> major problem regarding the lack of Indiana history at the
                    secondary level is the inability of concerned individuals and groups to maintain constant and
                    effective contact. There have been spurts of interest from one group or another at various times,
                    but there has rarely been a concerted effort to cooperate, to initiate courses, to provide
                    appropriate materials and guides for class use, to monitor the use of such materials, to respond to
                    curriculum changes, or, in fact, to sustain efforts in any of these areas.</p>
            <p>For example, Indiana history is now required on the fourth grade level. There is no required
                    textbook; anything available is outdated. The Indiana Historical Bureau provides printed materials
                    for class use which date from the 1940s and 1950s and which are barely adequate; teachers use these
                    materials by the thousands, but how? A teaching kit has been developed with federal funds in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName>; it is apparently being used throughout the state with local modifications, but how
                    many teachers do not know about it and what are its strengths and weaknesses? There are other
                    teaching tools at the elementary level in various places; why can we not make these better known and
                    available throughout the state? Some historical museums in the state have hundreds of school
                    visitors; others have few or take no part in their local educational process. What actually makes
                    the difference since size does not seem to be the determining factor? Can the successful museums
                    help the others? Several museums in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have highly developed educational programs that could be used as models aside from what
                    our own institutions could offer. What do teachers really want and need for teaching Indiana
                    history, and what can be done to answer those needs rapidly from existing resources?</p>
            <p>The situation at the elementary level is extremely relevant to efforts at the secondary level since
                    the same situation exists on a smaller scale, perhaps because there is no required course. We would
                    be foolish, however, to push once again for a required course in Indiana history—or even
                    an elective—without proper planning, including a consistent and sustained program for
                    more and better materials. The unit prepared in 1976 for both elementary and secondary study based
                    on George Rogers Clark was very successful, but what has become of it and how are teachers using it
                    without the impetus of the Bicentennial? The Indiana Historical Bureau still has in print <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History</hi>, and copies sell steadily. The bureau and other
                    publishers have volumes that could be used for classroom study on the secondary level. Some teachers
                    obviously do use these <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-077-1-083"/> volumes, but we do not know how and we do
                    not have the guide materials to encourage such use. I agree with both speakers that the new Indiana
                    studies course and materials are a good start; the materials have at least had input from major
                    segments—if not all—of the appropriate constituent groups.</p>
            <p>One could go on forever about what has not been done, but that does not solve any problems. Rather, I
                    would like to suggest some possibilities in line with Stevens's and Hodge's
                    observations, with my beliefs, with what is happening here and elsewhere, and with reality. I think
                    first that we must recognize the detrimental potential of a too narrow focus and of the reciprocal
                    prejudices that exist at all levels, especially among the groups that must cooperate if successful
                    teaching of Indiana history is to be achieved. Rather than say Indiana history belongs or does not
                    belong at a certain grade level, provide the incentives and the means to integrate it more
                    effectively at all levels and in various ways. The Mid-South Humanities project successfully relies
                    on English teachers, for example, as well as history teachers; other subject areas provide excellent
                    opportunities; and the arts and libraries have the best cultural lobbies in legislative bodies.
                    Anyone who has seen the Little Hoosier Historians at work or talked with some of our elementary
                    teachers must admit that elementary students can indeed learn something substantial about Indiana
                    history and can convey that knowledge often in sophisticated ways. In fact, they may even want to
                    enlarge that knowledge as they proceed through higher grades; the success of the Indiana Junior
                    Historical Society and the much newer History Day programs prove that such interest exists among
                    both students and teachers. Indiana's vast historical and cultural resources offer the
                    potential for activity in many disciplines and subject areas at all stages of the educational
                    process. Indiana history can best be served by a coordinated effort that uses resources most
                    economically and provides a wide range of opportunity for students and teachers in and out of the
                    classroom. This opinion seems to be widespread.</p>
            <p>Regardless of whether the requested educational director for the Indiana Historical Bureau is funded
                    in the state's coming biennium budget, the bureau will move to help facilitate such
                    cooperation. We need to know what resources exist and how they are used and to spread the word. We
                    need to make resources that do exist more useful by encouraging and disseminating appropriate guides
                    and supplemental teaching materials. Concurrently, we need to work on resources specifically
                    designed for class use that are adaptable enough to meet the <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-077-1-084"/>
                    needs of teachers and students at various grade levels and under a variety of local curriculum
                    restraints. Presumably such resources would combine all kinds of teaching materials—from
                    a basic textual approach to the most sophisticated audiovisual productions. In addition, a forum for
                    the exchange of information and ideas would seem to be desirable if interested groups want it and
                    would sustain it.</p>
            <p>"We" in the preceding paragraph refers to more than this state agency; the bureau
                    alone cannot meet these needs because it does not have the requisite expertise, although it has some
                    desirable elements to offer. Such accomplishments will not be fully realized unless and until the
                    cooperation of interested parties is achieved in a united program that draws upon the strengths of
                    all involved. The Indiana State Department of Public Instruction, school teachers, academic
                    historians, and representatives of local cultural organizations, for example, should be part of any
                    general planning group. To facilitate the exchange of information and ideas the bureau is willing to
                    begin production of a publication that has Indiana cultural education as its major focus. It could
                    be inexpensively produced in-house and marketed to the appropriate audiences at little cost. The
                    bureau will serve as the local sponsor for a Mid-South Humanities workshop on July 7–8,
                    1982, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Mid-South provides techniques and methods in using local cultural resources in the
                    classroom and can lay a firm foundation for extended methods training for teaching local history in
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p>To answer the challenges of Hodge and Stevens the bureau does care, and the bureau is moving in
                    various directions— albeit cautiously—to fulfill better its legislative
                    mandate to encourage the study of Indiana history. Given the fiscal restraints we all face, however,
                    unless we join forces in a meaningful way, we are still talking—or
                    writing—merely to hear ourselves talk. The latter situation may deceive us into thinking
                    that we have tried, but it does not get the job done. The real challenge is to all of
                    us—let's get the job done.</p>

                    <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-077-1-085"/> secondary curriculum. Certainly, readers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> require little persuasion on this issue. Neither do most
                    secondary social studies teachers and department heads. Most students enrolled in the few Indiana
                    high schools that offer a state history course enjoy it and encourage other students to take it.
                    And, the curriculum division of the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction has cleared the
                    way for a high school elective course in "Indiana studies." So, what's
                    the problem? Why do only an estimated one to two percent of Indiana high schools offer a course that
                    tells students about the sometimes wacky, frequently proud, but always interesting story of the
                    Hoosier state? The problem has three dimensions—space within the curriculum, appropriate
                    materials, and relevance to student and societal needs. Let's examine each of these
                    dimensions.</p>
            <p>It's absolutely true that there is little or no chance for another required social studies
                    course at either the junior high or senior high levels. With declining enrollments and
                    inflation-ravaged budgets, it's a struggle to maintain current curriculum standards. More
                    importantly, pressures caused by increased numbers of working students, early graduates, and related
                    cutbacks of daily school schedules are devastating the elective curriculum. Art, music, and foreign
                    language programs are suffering the most, but advanced courses in math, science, and industrial arts
                    are also being hit. Clearly, another required course (or for that matter, even a new elective) adds
                    to this dilemma. While I firmly believe that Indiana history should be an integral part of every
                    Hoosier's education, I'm reluctant to argue that he or she should eliminate a
                    foreign language—or art—or physics—or calculus in order to know
                    about "Blue Jeans" Williams or the reforms of Governor Paul V. McNutt.</p>
            <p>Is this "curriculum space" dilemma an insoluble problem? Probably not, but there
                    will be continuing tension caused by competing demands of more useful and necessary courses than
                    existing space or time in the school curriculum. Perhaps the best approach is to offer an Indiana
                    studies elective to attract interested students and "upgrade" the Indiana-specific
                    content of required courses such as eighth and eleventh grade <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history and twelfth grade government.</p>
            <p>Both Hodge and Stevens discussed the lack of effective instructional materials for teaching
                    secondary-level Indiana history. I agree that this is a problem, but it's much more easily
                    solved. Many teachers are using the outstanding materials available from the Indiana Junior
                    Historical Society. <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-077-1-086"/> Others use the George Rogers Clark project
                    or excerpts from Donald F. Carmony's <hi rend="i">Brief History of Indiana</hi>, published
                    by the Indiana Historical Bureau. For high school classes these materials can be combined with
                    articles from the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> to create an interesting, dynamic
                    set of readings. County historical societies frequently publish pamphlets focusing on local topics
                    and issues.</p>
            <p>But most teachers simply don't have the time or resources to develop an integrated program
                    based on such disparate resources. This is especially true when the Indiana history course is an
                    elective and represents only one fifth of a typical teacher's planning responsibility. The
                    new Indiana studies textbook, mentioned by Hodge, can meet many of these needs. But before I discuss
                    it further, let's look at the third dimension of the problem.</p>
            <p>What should students learn about their Hoosier heritage? Certainly they should know the major
                    historical events of the pioneer and early statehood periods. They should learn about Abraham
                    Lincoln's boyhood and Indiana's role in the Civil War and Wendell Willkie, too.
                    But traditional Indiana history is not enough. In recent years the concept of history has expanded
                    far beyond what most of us remember from our school days. Today's historians view the past
                    through lenses of economics, sociology, political science, and many other disciplines. Social
                    history examines the day-to-day lives of average citizens—what they ate, how they
                    worshipped, what they did for entertainment. What was it like to be a fifteen-year-old girl during
                    the Indiana pioneer period? What decisions did an eighteen-year-old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> boy have to make in 1861?</p>
            <p>Moreover, what should we teach about Indiana government? All students are required to take a
                    one-semester course in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government, usually during the twelfth grade. Very few students learn about Indiana
                    government. Most assume that the governor and the president are "sorta the same"
                    and that the state legislature works like the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Congress. To some extent this is true, but knowledge about state government is
                    essential for effective citizenship. About 80 percent of the laws that govern our daily lives are
                    state and local legislation. Therefore, it is just as important for Hoosier students to understand
                    Indiana lobbying laws or property tax limitations as it is for them to know about the congressional
                    committee system.</p>
            <p>Just about a year ago, the Indiana Council for the Social Studies (ICSS) approached officials at the
                    Lilly Endowment with a project based on the perceived needs of students, <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-077-1-087"/> teachers, and future Indiana citizens. ICSS members include elementary
                    and secondary teachers and college-level teacher trainers. The ICSS proposal identified many of the
                    concerns articulated in Hodge's and Stevens's arguments. We argued that (1) there
                    was a definite need for a secondary text on Indiana; (2) the text should be written by classroom
                    teachers who know the abilities and interests of students; (3) the content should be based on
                    traditional history but should be expanded to include social history, geography and economics, and
                    especially the development and operation of state government. With Lilly Endowment support the
                    textbook has reached the final development stage. Five classroom teachers—Lida Barker of
                    Gary, Pam Gunkel of <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>— spent five weeks researching and writing the text. Mary Jane Meeker, a
                    specialist in Indiana history, and Jane Lowrie of the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction
                    served as consultants. If all goes as scheduled, the book will be available for classroom use in the
                    fall of 1981.</p>
            <p>The new text combines recent historical interpretations with a lively writing style and classroom
                    activities. It is designed to be used as a basic text for a semester-long elective course or to be
                    integrated into a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history or government class. The Lilly Endowment has demonstrated again its thoughtful,
                    long-range encouragement for activities and projects designed to make Indiana a leader in
                    educational, cultural, and social affairs.</p>
            <p>The new Indiana studies textbook will not solve all the problems of teaching Indiana history in the
                    schools, but it's one more example of the keen interest and pride that many Hoosiers have
                    for their state. Combined with state and local historical society programs, the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau and Indiana Junior Historical Society, dedicated teachers like Hodge in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rushville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and even commercial support such as Hook's Drug Stores and the Indiana Farm
                    Bureau, Indiana history is a significant part of the daily lives of its citizens.</p>

                    they live in order to function effectively. Not just the "Where am I?" or
                    "What is this?" type of factual knowledge, but answers to the
                    "why" and "how" questions that bring meaning to the facts. This
                    orientation of leading the student from self outward has strong implications for teaching about the
                    home state at every grade level, thus establishing the relationships between whatever is being
                    taught to where the student is. It suggests exploring the present and, historically, how we arrived
                    at where we are and what we do. It implies more than Indiana history, but certainly not an absence
                    of it. Geography, culture, government, the arts, and, of course, basic skills, all play a role in
                    leading students to effective, responsible citizenship in their state and nation.</p>
            <p>The educational view of widening horizons is commonly used in the nation's elementary
                    schools. In Indiana's elementary schools there is much focus on various aspects of the
                    local community. A majority of the state's elementary schools teach some Indiana history in
                    the middle grades. The amount of time spent and what part of the history is taught varies from a few
                    weeks' focus on the early settlers to a full year spanning the range of Indiana's
                    history at the fourth grade. This is due to the long-standing view of the Indiana State Education
                    Commission that specific curriculum decisions should, by and large, be left to the local
                    district's discretion.</p>
            <p>Stevens has done a great service to the future potential for Indiana history in our secondary schools
                    by providing documentation of the long-term and growing interest of the public in this field of
                    study. In searching out documentation, however, it is not always easy to read between the lines and
                    perceive all the conditions that brought about past actions. In some respects it is like the meaning
                    of the word "Hoosier." In the early 1800s other people's perceptions of
                    those who lived in Indiana were quite different from today. Education was quite different, too. As
                    the sheer volume of knowledge has increased, our perceptions of what ought to be taught, when and
                    how much, have changed as well. Hoosiers were once perceived as backward, uneducated hillbillies.
                    Today "Hoosiers" rank among the top ten states in the nation in international
                    trade; hardly the conditions of one hundred years ago!</p>
            <p>Periodically over the past one hundred years, as Stevens points out, various groups have made
                    concerted efforts to promote the teaching of Indiana history in our schools. What he fails to note
                    are some of the major reasons why the subject has not received consistent, widespread
                    implementation.</p>
            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-077-1-089"/>
            <p>As more and more students continued in school to complete high school, graduation requirements began
                    to be formulated (such as a full year of American history at the secondary school level), still
                    leaving specific course content up to the local schools. The textbook adoption process, with the
                    accompanying category descriptions, has also influenced what courses are offered at the secondary
                    level. In today's world college and university entrance requirements also influence what
                    courses students take. There is certainly an abundance of knowledge on which to focus student
                    attention. But still, if there are justifiable reasons for teaching Indiana history in high school,
                    why is the practice not widespread?</p>
            <p>One reason is a lack of interest on the part of commercial publishers to invest financial resources
                    to produce textbooks, or any other compilation of materials, which focus exclusively on one state.
                    With the escalating printing costs of the past ten years, those few publishers who did produce
                    Indiana history texts have contacted the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction to state
                    that they would no longer be doing so, even if the text was written and ready for publication,
                    because they could no longer afford the financial loss. Another reason coupled with the first is a
                    paucity of interest on the part of Indiana historians in writing for precollegiate students,
                    accompanied by a lack of knowledge of how to write for them.</p>
            <p>But if not commercial publishers, why has the state failed to print these materials consistently over
                    time. The answer is simply a lack of appropriations to do so. There is a general lack of public
                    support to invest tax monies to develop and publish Indiana history materials. This stems partly
                    from the notion of "free" textbooks. There is, of course, no such thing as a
                    "free" textbook. Someone has to pay for them. The issue of who and how is one of
                    the great public debates which cannot be resolved here but, none the less, plays a critical role
                    when it becomes time to provide Indiana history materials for classroom use.</p>
            <p>There also seems to be a widely held belief that it takes little effort on the part of classroom
                    teachers to search out their own materials and put together a course of study on Indiana history,
                    thereby saving the money it would take to provide material for them. Indeed, nothing could be
                    further from the truth. It takes an unbelievable amount of time and effort to create individually a
                    course of study. Further, the availability of resources for such a project varies widely throughout
                    the state. This approach thus creates problems of wide variation in what is taught of
                    Indiana's history and in the quality of the material provided to the students.</p>
            <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-077-1-090"/>
            <p>Indiana's social studies teachers have demonstrated an interest in developing and publishing
                    materials on Indiana's history. As Hodge points out, there is a cooperative effort underway
                    to provide a textbook for the newly established Indiana studies course. In response to both Stevens
                    and Hodge, yes, the Indiana studies course does address the study of the state's
                    constitution, comparing it with that of our nation, but that is far from the scope of the project.
                    The material is replete with political, economic, and cultural history and delightful anecdotes
                    about people, art, and architecture during various time periods. The mechanism for a strong course
                    at the secondary level is in place. The textbook is well on the way to completion of the writing
                    phase, but there remains a strong challenge.</p>
            <p>The challenge is this: who, among all of the groups who wish to see the high school students of
                    Indiana learn more about their state, are willing to support the publication of material now being
                    developed? What sources of money can be utilized to help the cooperating groups complete the
                    project? The Indiana Council for the Social Studies membership (social studies teachers), the
                    Indiana Historical Society, and the Indiana Historical Bureau all seem to want the same goal. To
                    accomplish this, the answer lies with all who read these articles to support the effort to
                    completion.</p>

                        Indiana.</hi> By Grover L. Hartman. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Central Publishing Company, Inc., 1980. Pp. xiii, 106. Illustrations, notes.
                    Paperbound, $2.95.)</head>
            <p>Hoosiers who are celebrating the bicentennial of the Sunday school movement will especially welcome
                        <hi rend="i">A School for God's People.</hi> Although Grover L. Hartman has space only
                    for the bare bones of institutional development, his work fills some of the vacancies that have
                    prevented a complete understanding of the progress and regression of Indiana's Sabbath
                    schools. Observers knew, vaguely perhaps, that midwestern Sunday schools began as powerfully
                    influential offspring of Protestant evangelism and noted sadly how they have become, willy-nilly,
                    the worrisome stepchildren of modern church programming. Hartman's service is to trace the
                    descent of the institution from those early "big little schools" to the latter-day
                    "little little schools," from times when the movement was a radical departure in
                    frontier society to its present state of conservatism and lassitude. The movement expanded
                    vigorously throughout the nineteenth century, entered the twentieth with great expectations intact,
                    then foundered in the crosscurrents of the 1920s when professional educators began to tinker with
                    the traditional formula. It split between "church school" advocates and
                    "Sunday school" advocates, between denominationalists responding to rapid social
                    and theological change and inter-denominationalists who held firm for an ecumenical—and
                    uniformly bland—program of Biblical studies. In succeeding decades schools in mainline
                    churches atrophied, abdicating the popular front to fundamentalist groups.</p>
            <p>Hartman is a product of the Hoosier Sunday schools, which he unapologetically defends as the
                    wellspring of Protestant vitality. His purpose, in part, is to suggest that future growth of
                    mainline denominations is linked to their efforts in behalf of the movement. For church leaders the
                    theme is timely; evangelism is a favorite emphasis right now among traditionalists, such as the
                    Presbyterians, who helped found the pioneer schools but who have lost interest in the cause during
                    the past thirty years. One of Hartman's best chapters reviews byproducts of successful
                    Sunday schools: the Chatauqua, adult Bible classes, vacation church schools, even a style of church
                    architecture (the once ubiquitous Akron plan). More important, perhaps, were reforms that schools
                    abetted in earlier decades when they sometimes represented the only means of formal <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-077-1-092"/> education in pioneer neighborhoods and were the forerunners of public
                    schools. The movement's original crusade for literacy and social responsibility is surely a
                    more significant heritage than the Chatauqua circuit and drafty sanctuaries. Readers may wish
                    Hartman's emphases were different in some places, and his viewpoint less personal, but it
                    is also true that he touches nerves common in all Christian educators. For them, his concluding
                    queries are on target: "What have we now to serve as the nursery of the church …
                    [and] can we reclaim the Sunday school as the church's instrument of renewal and
                    evangelism" (pp. 97–98)?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">A School for God's People</hi> is not the thorough piece of scholarship that is
                    needed to measure the social impact of the Sunday school movement in Indiana. Hartman writes as an
                    advocate of the institution and as a prophet crying for renewal in Zion. This is perfectly
                    legitimate except that it limits his audience to those who share his instincts about religious
                    education generally. For social historians there is an outline of main events, a suggestion of
                    available resources, and an indication that much has yet to be written. Hartman supports his
                    narrative largely with statistics from various "annual reports" and with
                    information about venerable leaders of the movement. This is a view from the top, which defines
                    success as any huge, enthusiastic convocation of students kept busy with Bible recitation and hymn
                    singing. There is too little analysis of the schools' influence on community life, on
                    religious and moral values, and on Indiana politics. By the end of the last century such influence
                    was probably immense. It is surprising, also, that the author chose to take sides against the Yankee
                    preachers in the debate over who contributed most to the founding of Sunday schools in Indiana.
                    Hartman's own selection of eminent leaders includes many of those Yankees and argues
                    against the idea of an indigenous movement in the pioneer period.</p>
            <p>Because Hartman did not set out to satisfy social historians, he is excused from doing penance for
                    sins of omission. With those transgressions set aside, his book is a highly informative account of
                    the Indiana Sunday schools and will be especially helpful to ministers, Sunday school teachers, and
                    interested church members. Those who worry about church growth in the 1980s may find in
                    Hartman's devotion to the cause a guidepost toward that "right path"
                    which he is certain exists somewhere in the present darkness.</p>

            <p>Anyone who is at all familiar with the extensive transportation writings of economist-historian
                    George W. Hilton will have learned to expect a carefully researched, thoughtfully organized, and
                    finely tailored end product. Readers of the <hi rend="i">Monon Route</hi> will certainly not be
                    disappointed. In 311 pages of tightly structured text and illustrations, the author tells the story
                    of this modest midwestern carrier with dignity, verve, and affection, tempered with genuine candor.</p>

               </placeName>"
                        (<hi rend="i">Interstate Commerce Commission Reports</hi>, XXV, 313). Bereft of its colorful
                    history and stripped of its human component, this description of the Monon leaves it as stark and
                    bare as some of its abandoned branch lines in the 1930s.</p>
            <p>Hilton sets for himself the task of reviewing the Monon's more-than-a-century-old history
                    and introducing the lively human influences and geographic characteristics that made the
                    "Hoosier Line" practically synonymous with the state of Indiana. In some respects
                    Hilton succeeds almost too well. His is the difficulty experienced by all those who would combine a
                    picture book with serious history. How to present a magnificently profuse set of illustrations
                    (almost all of which are sharp and clear and add immeasurably to one's grasp and
                    appreciation of the Monon's style and service) along with a scholar's text must
                    continue to be a perplexing dilemma to author and publisher alike. One is reminded of a frequently
                    quoted dictum of Bismarck's that "when two ride a horse, one must ride
                    behind." Unfortunately, it is not always clear which is "riding behind,"
                    text or illustrations.</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, this is a beautiful and impressive volume. Almost everything that the lover of
                    railroad history could wish for is here in one form or another. The thread of corporate development
                    is clearly outlined along with examples of superior managerial leadership; i.e., the John Barriger
                    years. The excellent locomotive roster which appears at the back of the book (along with a workable
                    bibliography and a useful index) is an example of the attention given to matters of equipment,
                    plant, <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-077-1-094"/> and operating detail. Certainly not least of all, the
                    author succeeds very well in placing the Monon in the "here and now" and is not
                    afraid to speculate a bit on what its future may be in a strange (and greatly altered) modern
                    transportation environment. Having called attention to the difficult economic and engineering
                    problems which complicate its survival, the author comments wisely that though "the Monon
                    may have been unfortunate in its origins, … it was fortunate in its
                    enthusiasts." Hilton is clearly one of those enthusiasts.</p>

            <p>The Civil War dominates this volume of the Calvin Fletcher diary. Its pages are filled with comments
                    about military and political developments that are summarized from local and out-of-town newspapers,
                    descriptions of various wartime activities in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and observations on the impact of the conflict in the Hoosier capital.</p>
            <p>Fletcher's own war-related activities were limited. In April, 1861, at the request of
                    Governor Oliver P. Morton, he went on a mission to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to buy rifles for the Indiana troops then mustering. His most important later
                    contribution was as chairman of the joint (national and local) Sanitary Commission for caring for
                    wounded and sick soldiers. He was always a staunch supporter of the Union cause, becoming
                    increasingly antislavery and anti-South as the war went on.</p>
            <p>During the years 1861–1862 Fletcher was still concerned with the operations of the
                    Fletcher and Thomas H. Sharpe bank, but on a routine basis. Much less space is devoted to the
                    business than in preceding volumes. Fletcher was always thinking of his farm northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> even though he no longer managed it directly. He continued to be the leading figure in
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Benevolent Society. As an "original settler," he was in demand for
                    addresses before pioneer associations.</p>
            <p>Family matters receive much attention. Cooley, the eldest son, was, as earlier, a source of
                    exasperation because he contracted <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-077-1-095"/> debts that his father felt
                    obliged to pay. Calvin, Jr., was now on his own; therefore, he no longer involved his father in
                    large risks and losses as he had done when they were in partnership. Miles, at the time state
                    superintendent of public instruction, was killed in a train accident while accompanying Governor
                    Morton on a visit to Indiana troops in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Billy enlisted in the army and was captured in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> mountains while engaged in a rather foolhardy reconnoitering expedition. He was sent as
                    a prisoner to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, where he served as medical officer to his fellow
                    captives. He was later exchanged and returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> a hero. Keyes also enlisted and served in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Ingram managed the farm very capably until he was persuaded to enter the Fletcher and
                    Sharpe bank. Elijah gave up an unsuccessful pastorate in New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> to succeed Ingram as farm manager, though his health was not robust. Stoughton
                    continued quietly in his uncle's bank. Lucy left home to keep house for Ingram because she
                    chose not to get along with the second Mrs. Fletcher. Albert was still in school in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>. Calvin had difficulty in recognizing that his older children were grown up and wanted
                    to be independent; consequently, he was upset when his well-meant (and usually quite sound) advice
                    was resented by them as interference—as Keyes wrote to Ingram "pitching into you
                    in his old style" (p. 260).</p>
            <p>As in earlier volumes, there are a few erroneous conjectures in connection with transcriptions. On
                    page 60 it is stated that "Albert brot from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> a color [print?] of Mr. Abbotts house"; of course what he brought was a sample
                    of the paint on a shingle or a piece of tin. Cutworms are described on page 129 as having eaten
                    "some of the beards [heads?] off the rye and some of the wheat." The beards are
                    bristles on the heads, not, as is suggested, the heads themselves. On page 138 the editors are
                    puzzled by a passage which they transcribe as "a wet harvest vested [?] wheat
                    &amp;c." "Vested" is obviously a misreading for
                    "rusted." All these are trifling blemishes in a volume which has the same high
                    standards of editing as its predecessors.</p>

            <p>If Americans are going to come to terms with their industrial cities of the nineteenth century, they
                    will need some guidance. This volume is a step in that direction. Two urban historians briefly
                    sketch the development of seventeen community areas that together form a triangle extending roughly
                    eight miles south and southwest from the mouth of the <geogName>Chicago River</geogName>. These
                    community areas, or neighborhoods, were defined by sociologists nearly fifty years ago as a way to
                    analyze the city. Glen E. Holt and Dominic A. Pacyga largely accept the validity of these units and
                    conveniently use them as the organizing device to bring together a variety of information about the
                    city.</p>
            <p>Each community is presented in several ways. First, an essay weaves together data on the original
                    settlers, the development of urban transportation, institutions located in the community, centers of
                    employment, demographic patterns, and types of housing. Second, a portfolio of illustrations, each
                    with a helpful caption, presents the "look" of the community over time. These
                    pictorial resources are, in many ways, the heart of the book.</p>
            <p>Much less satisfying is the early-twentieth-century city street map that has been cut into fragments
                    and reprinted in seventeen sections to give a spatial description of each neighborhood. Since the
                    map is dated 1904, it needs analysis itself as a historical document and has many limits as a guide
                    to the communities. Because each area is only a fragment of the whole map, street names often do not
                    appear on the reprinted section; thus, using the maps as locational aids for places mentioned in the
                    text or described in the illustrations often becomes an exercise in futility.</p>
            <p>However, Holt and Pacyga are not primarily interested in geographic description or architectual
                    landmarks; instead, they are after the broader themes of demographic movement and community change.
                    In most cases the transitions they describe seem so rapid, so fundamental, and so constant that one
                    gets a feeling of basic instability. Only in a few cases has the flux been moderated enough to
                    create the stability which makes a community liveable from one generation to the next. The most
                    unstable areas that the book describes are the Loop, the Union Stock Yards, and the Central
                    Manufacturing District. The <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-077-1-097"/> Loop, it is helpful to remember, was
                    a primary residential area for most of its history, a function it may regain in the near future.</p>
            <p>Much thought has been given to ways in which the central business district might maintain its
                    vitality. The old streetcar neighborhoods deserve the same consideration. How have they changed in
                    the past? How are they changing today? How can change be managed in the future? As urban planners
                    ponder these questions about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s South Side, this volume should serve as an excellent place to begin building
                    the answers.</p>

            <p>This study examines the public service activities of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first generation of academic professionals. Beginning with the founding of
                    the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1892, Steven J. Diner describes the role of faculty and administrators in the urban
                    progressive movement. The account ends in 1919 with the unsuccessful attempt by Charles Merriam, a
                    political scientist from the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> with an impressive record of political achievement, to unseat Mayor William Hale (Big
                    Bill) Thompson in the Republican primary election.</p>
            <p>Two major themes essential to the process of modernization provide the background for this book: (1)
                    the development of a complex, interdependent urban pattern of life and (2) the emergence of the
                    university as the major agency for the discovery and dissemination of knowledge. In discussing the
                    relationship between the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its four universities—<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Northwestern, Loyola, and DePaul— Diner attempts to explore the evolution
                    of "our modern mechanisms of public policy" (p. 87). He does so by examining
                    community service, that area of faculty performance which was then, and is today, least understood
                    in terms of professional role.</p>
            <p>Diner considers major public policy issues, including public education, criminal justice, social
                    welfare, and urban planning and administration. Academicians identified with these subject areas
                    participated in shaping related policy, albeit in limited numbers and with varying degrees of
                    success. These specialists, <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-077-1-098"/> primarily from the emerging fields
                    of social science, conveyed an outlook which valued scientific research, specialized training, and
                    professional expertise. Examples to indicate that similar developments existed in other town-gown
                    settings are included.</p>
            <p>Faculty participation is set in the context of urban reform. Diner analyzes major civic organizations
                    and identifies persons affiliated with three or more of them. He argues that progressive reform in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was led by upper-class businessmen, usually Republican in political orientation and
                    Protestant in religious belief. Added to this group were aspiring professionals, twenty-five of whom
                    were university professors. Of these, twelve are characterized as leaders, with Merriam's
                    career illustrating the failure of these reformers to gain the political control necessary to put
                    their scientific methods to work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">A City and Its Universities</hi> presents new material in a well-organized study.
                    Unfortunately, Diner's reliance on personal papers and biographical accounts distorts the
                    picture. The substantial role played by ethnic groups and organized labor in urban progressivism is
                    virtually ignored. The book is weakened further by errors of fact and interpretation. In two
                    separate places Diner states that William Thompson defeated Carter Harrison II for mayor in 1915.
                    Harrison lost in the Democratic primary to Robert Sweitzer. While the school controversy of 1915 to
                    1917 included the issue of tenure, the real struggle centered on the affiliation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Teachers' Federation with organized labor. Diner's attempt to argue
                    that academicians sought control of public functions remains unconvincing: there is little evidence
                    to support his claim that professors from the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> "took the lead in the battle for the control of the public schools"
                    (p. 85). The phrase "hardly impressive" is used to conclude Diner's
                    assessment regarding criminal justice; this same description seems appropriate to the general record
                    of academic participation in public affairs.</p>

            <p>John D. Wright has placed Transylvania in the context of the history of higher education in general,

                    </placeName> politics (he did not investigate the charges of the college's being a hotbed
                    of Federalism) and urban rivalry as they affected antebellum Transylvania.</p>
            <p>Some libraries may have bought this book in 1975. The present volume is a revised edition, and the
                    few changes are instructive. The tone of the final pages is more optimistic. Gone is the statement
                    that "Transylvania has struggled with the challenge of defining its role as a small
                    [present enrollment 805] church-related, liberal arts college, … in a rapidly changing
                    American Society where the survival of such a college becomes increasingly difficult" (p.
                    430, 1975 edition). Gone also is the declaration that "the past achievements …
                    do not automatically guarantee its future survival" (p. 431, 1975 edition). Even more
                    noteworthy is the absence of the statement that "this institution shared in the munificence
                    of federal appropriations to higher education" (p. 428, 1975 edition).</p>
            <p>Transylvania was a key institution in the Old West. The reissue of this volume by the University

                    </placeName>'s Civil War history is not so dramatic or so filled with conflict as that of
                    other states of the present Middle West because the opposition to the Republicans was a much smaller
                    minority in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> than it was in Indiana or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Hubert H. Wubben makes the most of it, however, and scarcely leaves a solitary aspect
                    of the opposition unexplored. Since the Copperhead movement, as Wubben terms the anti-Republican
                    forces, was comparatively small and insignificant, this book is in a large part a social history
                    stressing the impact of the Civil War on social standards and behavior with a strong sidelight on
                    economics. Some may therefore find the title a little misleading.</p>
            <p>The author has some difficulty with definitions, most notably that of Copperhead. Members of this
                    group are defined as Democrats who opposed the war as well as the policies of the national
                    administration, in some cases even to the extent of favoring a Confederate victory. War Democrats
                    come in two categories. One, not to be confused with the Copperheads, supported the war but opposed
                    the Republicans politically. The other supported both the war and the national administration and so
                    was almost indistinguishable from the Republicans. Fine distinctions are required, particularly in
                    dealing with Democratic factionalism, and they are not always successfully made.</p>
            <p>Some durable Civil War myths are effectively undermined. One is that the Germans were overwhelmingly
                    Republican, when in fact most of them were Democrats. Another is that Democrats were grossly
                    underrepresented among volunteers for the army. Yet another is that the fabled Knights of the Golden
                    Circle extended its poisonous tentacles even into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The author's steadfast objectivity accounts for his departure from long-accepted Civil War
                    beliefs. Wubben takes nothing for granted and accepts nothing uncritically. His neutrality is
                    perhaps carried too far in his treatment of the national administration's ruthless
                    suppression of what was essentially a legitimate opposition, and an insignificant one at that. Also,
                    it is doubtful if <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Marshal Herbert M. Hoxie was without both inspiration and sanction from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    cranky radical conservatives," the Copperheads, had nothing to offer but criticism of those
                    who were attempting to <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-077-1-101"/> restore the Union. Actually, they had

            <p>Research is admirably done, and the writing is superb. Reliance is placed on original sources, such
                    as local newspapers, which are too commonly neglected. Wubben's literary style makes his

                    in-depth study of events and attitudes on the local level, just the sort of thing that seems most
                    needed in the field of Civil War history.</p>

            <p>This book, originally conceived by the American Historical Association in 1977 as "a report

                    "broader and deeper than anyone envisioned at the outset" (p. 11). The result is a
                    publication of great significance—a benchmark volume that professional historians will
                    refer to frequently, graduate students studying for qualifying examinations will devour, and anyone

                    One—"Units of Time and Areas of Study"—examines American scholarship
                    in seven broad temporal and geographic fields (e.g., Early Modern Europe, Asia). Part
                    Two—"Expanding Fields of Inquiry"—focuses on eight areas of
                    investigation that underwent substantial growth and/or change during the past decade (labor history,
                    Afro-American history, and family history, for example). Finally, Part
                    Three—"Modes of Gathering and Assessing Historical Material"—treats
                    methodological innovations in research (oral, psycho-, quantitative social-scientific, and

            <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-077-1-102"/>
            <p>Inevitably, the quality of the essays varies. Virtually all are well written and well documented,
                    however, and the bibliographic overview of recent scholarship provided in the footnotes is itself
                    worth the price of the volume. Among the essays dealing exclusively or primarily with <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history, this reviewer found only "The Negro in American History" to
                    be unsatisfactory—largely because it focuses on just a few major monographs. Readers of
                    the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, who presumably have special interests in state
                    and local history, are directed to Kathleen Neils Conzen's "Community Studies,
                    Urban History, and American Local History" and Herbert T. Hoover's "Oral
                    History in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>."</p>
            <p>Although it is dangerous to generalize from a volume that ranges so broadly, two trends seem
                    unmistakable. First is the overwhelming impression of the vigor—indeed
                    domination—of social history during the past decade. Peter N. Stearns observes in his
                    essay that although debate continues on the definition of social history, those who share
                    "at the very least a concern for achieving a historical perspective on the everyday
                    activities of ordinary people, have steadily grown in number and expanded the range of their
                    activity" (p. 205). Many of the other contributors offer similar comments. Second, the
                    increasing Balkanization of the profession stands out in bold relief. It is notable that many of the
                    scholarly specialties treated here in depth would not even have been accorded separate-chapter
                    status ten or fifteen years ago. As Kammen puts it, if Clio's house has always had many
                    mansions "it would now seem that History has suburbs and shantytowns, trailer parks and
                    condominiums as well" (p. 45). Many of the contributors put "synthesis"
                    near the top of the profession's agenda for the 1980s.</p>
            <p>Thanks are due all concerned for this useful and well-produced examination of what might be called
                    the "Transition Decade" of American historical scholarship. It deserves to be
                    widely read and thoughtfully considered.</p>

            <p>Here and there in America today are men and women who remember a country water mill to which in the
                    early part of this century local farmers still hauled their grain to have it ground for livestock
                    feed. From the beginning of settlement almost every stream-side village had its water mill for
                    grinding wheat and corn. "At the high tide of their usefulness in the mid-nineteenth
                    century," Louis C. Hunter writes, "country mills … were reported by the
                    federal census in the tens of thousands" (p. 1). Numerous, too, were waterpowered sawmills
                    and fulling mills (where country-made cloth was prepared for market). Nor was waterpower confined to
                    the rural scene, as numerous remnants of waterpowered industrial sites around the country still
                    attest. Despite a popular tendency to equate the industrial revolution with the application of steam
                    power to manufacturing (a tendency that the title of this volume—<hi rend="i">Waterpower
                        in the Century of the Steam Engine</hi>—does nothing to dispel), as late as 1850
                    waterpower was "the leading source of mechanical power on both sides of the
                    Atlantic" (p. 45). Not until the latter part of the nineteenth century did waterpower
                    gradually give way in America to steam power, while even in its relative decline the older power
                    source was the occasion of a rich technological development.</p>
            <p>It is this story that Hunter tells with unimpeachable authority, and there is something in his book
                    for every thoughtful reader in this energy-conscious age. The volume falls roughly into three parts.
                    The initial chapters, concerned with the country mills, will appeal to all students of pioneer life
                    who go beyond the superficial to discover the ways in which our predecessors on this continent
                    managed their economy. The middle chapters chronicle the development of hydraulic facilities for the
                    early industrial revolution, the growth of some of the first industrial cities in the Merrimack
                    Valley of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and at the falls of St. Anthony on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and the management of large waterpowers. These chapters might stand alone as a
                    monograph for economic, business, and local historians, but all readers will profit from being
                    reminded that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> became one of the great industrial nations of the world without burning a drop of oil.
                    The last third of Hunter's book, largely an account of American adaptation and use of the
                    French-invented hydraulic turbine, "the leading nineteenth-century innovation in waterwheel
                    design before hydroelectricity" (p. 537), will appeal principally to historians of
                    technology. Indeed, the entire book is a treasure trove for this latter group, for while Hunter is
                    concerned with the social, economic, and physical environment in which his <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-077-1-104"/> waterwheels turned, it is clearly the machinery itself that interests
                    him most.</p>
            <p>This is not a book for whiling away the hours on a warm summer's day. It requires close
                    application. Sometimes lacking in tight organization, occasionally repetitive, it spares the reader
                    no tedious detail. And while some technological descriptions are marvelously clear, others quickly
                    leave the neophyte engineer far behind. The book is worth the attention it requires, however, for
                    like Hunter's earlier work, <hi rend="i">Steamboats on the Western Rivers</hi> (1949), it
                    is destined to become a classic. The first of three projected volumes on industrial power in
                    America, <hi rend="i">Waterpower in the Century of the Steam Engine</hi> is profusely illustrated
                    with photographs and diagrams. There is no bibliography, but documentation is more than ample. The
                    second volume of the series, on steam power, is promised in the near future. Together the two books
                    will constitute a definitive history of industrial power in nineteenth-century America.</p>

            <p>Carl N. Degler's <hi rend="i">At Odds</hi> is a valuable survey of recent research in
                    American women's and family history from the late eighteenth century to the present. In
                    synthesizing two often distinct fields, he demonstrates the persistent tension between
                    women's search for autonomy and their family roles. For general readers and historians
                    unfamiliar with these rapidly growing fields, Degler provides a richly detailed and provocative
                    overview of the literature. Specialists, too, will find <hi rend="i">At Odds</hi> an exceptionally
                    important study for its discussion and analysis of the numerous controversies that have emerged as
                    historians increase their knowledge of the female experience in America. Degler's inclusion
                    of many interesting, but as yet unpublished, studies is also laudable; the absence of citations for
                    some other discussions, however, is unfortunate.</p>
            <p>Degler has not attempted to cover all periods or topics at equal length—a decision that
                    reflects both the state of the two fields and his own expertise. The treatment of the lives of
                    middle-class women in the nineteenth century has a multidimensional quality and includes discussions
                    of women's roles as wives and mothers, childrearing methods, sisterhood, declining <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-077-1-105"/> fertility, and sexuality. Degler deals with women and the family
                    in the twentieth century in a much more cursory manner. Although he dismisses this disparity by
                    noting that "Most readers, after all, know from first-hand experience something of the
                    nature of the twentieth century family" (p. ix), the social history of women and the family
                    in this period is in a rudimentary stage and is in many respects far less complete than knowledge
                    for the previous century.</p>
            <p>Degler agrees with those historians who have challenged the notion that the colonial era constituted
                    a "golden age" in which American women enjoyed a better position in the family and
                    society than their sisters in the nineteenth century. In his interesting analysis of female
                    sexuality, Degler argues that women's lives actually improved in the later century,
                    especially in regard to their autonomy within the family. Although some prescriptive literature and
                    some medical men viewed female sexuality as "undeveloped and perhaps even absent,"
                    Degler does not believe that "during the 19th century women's sexuality was
                    generally denied or effectively suppressed" (p. 269). Attitudes regarding female sexuality
                    derived in large part, Degler concludes, from the attempt to control male sexuality and to enhance
                    women's position within marriage. Men who "overindulged" endangered their
                    wives' health; thus, underlying the emphasis on sexual restraint was the premise that
                    "mutuality was at the heart of sexual pleasure and therefore a happy and fulfilling
                    marriage" (p. 273).</p>
            <p>Most of Degler's book deals with the middle-class experience, but his discussion of the
                    lives of black women is very perceptive. Although he draws extensively on Herbert G.
                    Gutman's <hi rend="i">The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom</hi> (1976), he differs from
                    Gutman on the extent to which whites influenced black family behavior. His treatment of immigrant
                    families, however, is less satisfying than the literature on this subject merits. Degler is content
                    to summarize a few of the recent studies and thus fails to convey the diversity of experience within
                    immigrant groups depending on the occupational structure they encountered.</p>
            <p>Finally, this excellent and important book is occasionally marred by an insensitivity to the
                    sex-specific dilemmas faced by American women. Degler asserts, for example, that women have chosen
                    to put family before career. "Confronted with the social, psychological, or emotional costs
                    of being unable to have children and family if she chose a career, the wife chose to opt for family
                    and a secondary job, rather than a career. That was a constrained choice, to be sure, but a choice
                    nonetheless" (p. <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-077-1-106"/> 434). One must question if Degler
                    really understands the meaning of those constraints.</p>

                    preacher in his German homeland, and Martin Boehm, a Mennonite, who at a Boehm revival on a

                    Jacob Albright, an "honest tilemaker," who was licensed to preach by the
                    Methodists. The need for a German-language ministry led him to bring together in 1803 five of his
                    congregations to form the Evangelical Association. After holding conferences from 1789 on, the
                    United Brethren had been formally organized as a church in 1800.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> origin and their initial commitment to the German-speaking people—mostly
                    distressed and poor—developed side by side and moved westward concurrently. Their leaders
                    proclaimed Christian assurance. Their golden text might well have been: "It is the Spirit
                    himself bearing witness to our spirit that we are the children of God" (Romans 8:16). This
                    assurance brought joy, optimism, and confidence. In addition, sanctification, a John Wesley
                    doctrine, was espoused as a summons to Christian growth in personal and ethical living.</p>
            <p>On their pilgrimage the two denominations prospered moderately, recording their share of triumphs and
                    reverses. The Evangelical Association merged with the United Evangelical church and in the process
                    lost a number of congregations, which continued their more conservative way in the Evangelical
                    Congregational church. The United Brethren, as they grew and mingled with other churches, were
                    abandoned by a section of their fellowship which became the United Brethren (Old <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-077-1-107"/> Constitution). The main bodies found it relatively easy to join in 1946
                    to form the Evangelical United Brethren church. By the time of their merger with the Methodist
                    church in 1968, the "EUB's" represented a constituency of 768,099 members
                    in 4,048 local churches, which had compiled an annual giving record of $59,819,189
                    ($80.00 per member).</p>
            <p>J. Bruce Behney and Paul H. Eller divided their auctorial chores at the year 1890, Behney writing the
                    story up to that year and Eller covering the subsequent period. Readers of their book will be
                    impressed with the emphasis on factual material and the relative lack of psychological analysis. The
                    treatment centers on "when" and "how" rather than
                    "why." The authors do not claim any detached objectivity; they confess their
                    esteem and respect for the church they have chronicled. They do not, however, gloss over the schisms
                    and littleness that could be branded faults in the fellowships they love. Overall, Behney and Eller
                    have come up with a genuine contribution to American religious history.</p>

                    there are very good dissertations not listed because they were done at institutions outside the

                    scholar and his knowledge of <placeName>

                    immensely interesting to the general reader and useful to the scholar as well. Bigham expertly shows
                    the range and diversity of German culture in the early twentieth century—in churches,
                    social organizations, schools, businesses, newspapers, and foods—and he assays the extent
                    to which that ethnic legacy remains present in southwestern Indiana in the late twentieth century.

                    characterize these volumes of Grant's papers. Volume 7 covers a "winter of
                    discontent" followed by unsuccessful efforts in early 1863 to capture Vicksburg, which led
                    to low morale in the army and adverse criticism of its commander. In volume 8 Grant confounds his
                    critics with the brilliant, innovative campaign that led to the surrender of the city. Both volumes
                    document the incompetence of Grant's meddlesome subordinate, political general John A.

                        <p>The review begins, "Most books in the <hi rend="i">States and the

                                    tolerance at best and ridicule at worst." That's a puzzle because
                                    it was demonstrably false when written, as any half-serious survey of scholarly
                                    reviews would show, and of course is unmistakeably refuted by the laudatory reviews
                                    of most of the books in the series published by five scholars in the June, 1980,
                                    issue of the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review.</hi>

                        <p>Later in the review Ridge criticizes Jensen's book for things that
                                    "may not be his fault. He probably had a shoot-out with the editors of the
                                    series and had to compromise…. " Probably? At least a quick
                                    phone call to the editors would have seemed in order to check grounds for a potshot
                                    like that. If Dr. Ridge becomes interested in the actual facts, I'll be
                                    glad to provide them.</p>

                    "Generations, the Family in American Life: A Dialogue with the Community" is to be

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on March 25–27, 1982. The conference proposes to assess the current state of
                    knowledge about the American family in the past and present and, upon the basis of this information,
                    to speculate about its future. Following the format of the 1978 conference in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on Childhood in American Life, this will be an interdisciplinary symposium for the
                    exchange of information about current research. It will not, however, be a specialized conversation
                    between researchers, but rather a sharing of knowledge with the concerned community. Papers are
                    especially sought that discuss the nature and roles of American families of varying <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-077-1-113"/> ethnic and national origins in the American past, based on, among other
                    approaches, genealogical research, as well as papers that consider the relationship of styles of
                    dwellings to family life in the past, present, and future (and the role of historic preservation in
                    facilitating such study). Papers that explain the role of museums and other historical research
                    collections in providing data for the study of family living patterns and for giving the present
                    generation a graphic sense of family life in the past are also sought. Submit proposals to: <placeName>
