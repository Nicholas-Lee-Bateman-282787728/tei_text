            <byline>LENA C. LOGAN</byline>
            <p>At the beginning of the presidential year of 1872, revolt was brewing in the incumbent Republican
                    party against the Radical faction which dominated it. This was caused in part by Grant's
                    ineptitude as President, by numerous scandals in high public office, and especially by the harshness
                    of Congress' reconstruction policy toward the South. A ground swell of discontent was rising among
                    moderate Republicans throughout the North. The movement first came to a head in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. A so-called Liberal Republican group organized there in the late sixties. It was led
                    by moderate Republicans who opposed the postwar Republican state administration's severe
                    proscription of ex-Confederates. Many Democrats, living under the suspicion of treason, were glad to
                    join the group in the hope of obtaining political amnesty. The Liberals carried the <placeName>

                    </placeName> state elections in 1870. They sent their outstanding leader, Carl Schurz, to the Senate
                    and placed B. Gratz <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the governor's chair. The new party's chief principles included
                    amnesty to the South, civil service reform, and tariff reform.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The movement attracted widespread attention throughout the country because of its timeliness and
                    success. Many people felt that it should be extended to the nation as a whole. In September of 1871,
                    Carl Schurz raised the banner for a national Liberal independent third party to run a presidential
                    candidate against Grant who was sure to be the Radicals' choice in 1872. Reformers of various
                    stripes cast interested glances at the project:low-tariff men, Eastern <list type="footnotes">

                    various others tending toward the "lunatic fringe." The most serious problem which
                    confronted the Liberals after they had won over the moderate Republicans of the North was to gain
                    the adherence of the Democratic party, both North and South. Grant could be defeated only by a
                    coalition of this magnitude. It was especially necessary that Southern Democrats be won over.
                    Liberal leaders and many of the moderate Republicans were becoming convinced that the welfare of the
                    entire nation demanded that the Federal troops and other types of Federal interference in the
                    ex-Confederate states should be removed and full home rule restored to the South. Southerners were
                    in a most difficult frame of mind: the raw sores of the war were constantly being irritated by
                    Congress' reconstruction policy, a new race antagonism had arisen, along with a blind resentment
                    against everything labelled "Yankee." Liberals had to overcome their distrust and bring
                    them to see that their only hope of home rule lay in cooperation with the best elements in the North
                    to bring about the end of Radical rule, rather than a stubborn refusal to cooperate in any way with
                    the Northerners. Suspicion and resentment existed on the other side, too; many moderate Northern
                    Republicans looked at Ku Klux activities and were doubtful whether the South had accepted the
                    results of the war in good faith.</p>
            <p>The press was naturally vitally interested in the Liberal group. The post-Civil War period was the
                    heyday of the great personal editors. Prior to the war, journalists were often mere party hacks; by
                    1900, the "counting-room," that is, considerations of finance and advertising, influenced
                    editorial policies. But for a generation or so, they were able to keep themselves relatively free
                    from outside pressure. A number of editors of outstanding ability and great force of character
                    attracted to themselves tremendous personal followings, whose first thought on grabbing the paper in
                    the morning was to turn to the editorial page and "see what old So and So says." The
                    attitude of leading editors in the various sections was bound to be enormously important in
                    determining the successes of the Liberal movement which depended upon popular support rather than
                    party machine.</p>
            <p>The dean of American journalists and one of the most outstanding editors of the country was Horace
                    Greeley of the <pb n="321" id="VAA4025-040-4-005"/> New York <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>. He had made
                    a really great contribution in the building up of Northern public opinion against slavery in the
                    generation before the war and he had helped build up the Republican party's strength. These
                    contributions, as well as his well-known eccentricities of person and of minor principles, had made
                    violent friends and enemies for him. He consistently baited the South and the Democratic party
                    before the war but, since its close, had advocated sectional reconciliation and amnesty for the
                    South. His support would be valuable for the Liberal movement but not in a position of leadership,
                    as he was still suspect to the South.</p>
            <p>Other prominent younger Republication editors of independent views came out hearticly for the
                    Liberals, whose principles they had been advocating for some time in their crusade against Grantism.
                    The more outstanding of these included SAmuel Bowles of the Springfield, Massachusetts, <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>, Horace White of the Chicago <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi>, and Murat Halstead of
                    the Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Commercial</hi>.</p>
            <p>The support of the Southern Democratic press was particularly needed by the Liberal movement. Henry
                    Watterson of the Louisville, Kentucky, <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi> took a friendsly attitude
                    from the beginning. His record for the past few years explains this stand. Although a Tennessee
                    Democrat and apparently a Unionist at heart, he had been a Confederate soldier and the editor of a
                    Confederate army newspaper during part of the war. When the war was barely over, in the spring of
                    1865, he became an editor of the Cincinnati <hi rend="i">Evening Times</hi>; and in the Northern
                    setting, the young ex-Confederate began his long crusade for reconciliation between the sections. He
                    continued the work for a while on the editorial page of the Nashville, Tennessee, <hi rend="i">Republican Banner</hi>. In 1868, he helped organize the Louisville <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi>, which was a fusion of the ex-Unionist Louisville <hi rend="i">Daily
                    Journal</hi> of George D. Prentice and the ex-Confederate Louisville <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>. He
                    attained nation-wide prominence during the next fifty years as its editor. For the first ten years
                    or so of his career there, he devoted himself chiefly to his crusade for sectional reconciliation.
                    His primary concern was the restoration and rehablitation of the South. He felt that this could best
                    be attained by forgiving and forgetting about the war and turning the attention of both the North
                    and the South to the new problems which were arising in the postwar era. By<pb n="322" id="VAA4025-040-4-006"/> 1872, Watterson appeared to be winning an uphill fight for recognition
                    of himself and his principles in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and to some extent in the deep South. He had also won definite approval from
                    journalists in other sections, particularly the Northeast.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> During the course of
                    the campaign of 1872, Thomas Nast and other cartoonists introduced the public of both sections to
                    the dashing, ebullient young man with long flowing blond mustache and hair. His robust and usually
                    vehement editorials were followed by a widening circle of readers.</p>
            <p>Overtures looking toward a coalition were made by Liberals to Southern Democrats as early as the fall
                    of 1871. Democrats were discouraged by failure in the recent elections and were amiably disposed to
                        listen,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> but each group was afraid that it would be swallowed up by the
                    other. At the beginning of 1872, everybody waited for the situation to clarify. Watterson advised
                    his following in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and other parts of the South to "lie low and keep dark."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On January 4, 1872, the Liberal Republican state convention of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> issued a call for a national Liberal Republican convention to meet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in May. Watterson remarked approvingly, "This begins to look like business"
                    and wished them "all possible success." He added that the <placeName>

                    of the political situation as it affected Southern Democrats in general and one Southern Democratic
                    editor in particular. He could not afford to get out on a limb too far in supporting the Liberals
                    and thus run the risk of being repudiated by the Democrats. His attitude was mainly one of watchful
                    waiting or what he called "masterly activity." Sending up trial balloons or smoke screens
                    as the occasion might demand, he felt his way carefully. His main <list type="footnotes">

                    the South, to which end he worked for years in an attempt to reconcile the two sections in feeling.
                    In 1872, the chief tangible step possible toward the accomplishment of his purpose was the defeat of
                    Grant and the Radicals. This could be brought about only by a coalition of Liberal Republicans and
                    Democrats. Before Watterson came out openly and advised Democrats to join the Liberals, he waited
                    for several things to happen. The Liberals must give definite proof that they had broken clean with
                    Radical interests and the hypnotic influence of Republican party spirit. They must also nominate a
                    good ticket which the South would be willing to support. If they fulfilled both these conditions and
                    if the great independent Republican editors gave the movement their support, then Grant's
                    doom was certain, Watterson believed. The Democrats would show the "wildest folly" in such a case,
                    if they nominated a third ticket.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> He wrote in March, "We hold the old
                    Ship of Zion well to the wind, though we do fly a white flag and are keeping a sharp look-out for
                    friendly signals."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Watterson worked all during the spring of 1872 to reassure and bring together various discordant
                    elements in the proposed coalition. He reassured Democrats who were afraid of Horace Greeley, the
                    pioneer Republican, with the assertion, "There is nothing in the creed of Thomas Jefferson that
                    Horace Greeley may not faithfully subscribe to." One of the most intransigent groups of
                    die-hard Southerners, opposed to any suggestion of reconciliation or cooperation with anything
                    Northern, was led by Alexander H. Stephens, former vicepresident of the Confederacy. Watterson
                    assured Stephens that he would find no difficulty in subscribing to all the principles of
                    Greeley's <placeName>

                    which, however, were of permanent importance to both persons. Watterson probably drove the blood
                    pressure of Democratic worthies several points higher when he went so far as to assert that even the
                    name "Democrat" was not sacred. "If the old Ship of Zion seem irreligious or old-fogyfied, call her
                    the Young Ironsides. In other words, what's in a name?"<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Republican ill-wishers expected questions of party principle such as. tariff and currency to be the
                    great stumbling blocks of the Liberal convention and to prevent subsequent coalition with the
                        Democrats.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Although Watterson was a strong advocate of lower tariff during
                    much of hi$ fifty-odd-year career as an editor, at this time he relegated it to the background. He
                    and all Southerners felt that the Southern question far transcended it in importance. He was not
                    sure, however, that Liberal Republicans were sufficiently convinced of its importance; from a purely
                    political standpoint, this question had to be stressed in order to attract Southern votes to the
                    Liberals. Amnesty to the South had been a cardinal principle of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Liberals from the beginning. But now, Watterson felt that the movement had come to be
                    dominated by Easterners, who stressed tariff and civil service reform above the Southern issue.
                    There was no strong positive hand of sympathy between these two political, or rather sectional,
                    groups. Watterson jibed at the Eastern Liberals as being "too mathematical, too precise, too
                    passionless, too timid" to appeal to enough voters to win an American political campaign. They
                    needed emotional appeal which could be furnished by the Southern question. "A great political
                    revival cannot be attained by the application of the rule of three." The Liberals "must, as
                    they say on the river, 'fire up.'"<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even at times such as this, when he was assuming to address the South and the whole nation, Watterson
                    had to keep a watchful eye on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Democrats, whom many observers accused of being notoriously unruly and ready to break
                    over the traces at the slightest provocation. Early in 1872, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Democratic party situation was relatively quiet. A knock-down and drag-out fight had
                    raged between Democratic state administration leaders at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who represented the Bluegrass section of the state on the one side and
                    Watterson's Courier-Journal and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> interests on the other. The chief question involved in the quarrel was acceptance of
                    the results of the war, particularly the changed status of the negro, and a more amicable attitude
                    toward the North.</p>
            <p>By 1872, Watterson and his group felt that they had won; at least the administration leaders appeared
                    less intransigent. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>By the latter part of April, the national political situation was shaping up well enough for
                    Watterson to become moderately optimistic. Liberals were no longer demanding that the Democratic
                    party should dissolve its identity in supporting them; all they asked was Democratic help in a
                    coalition to defeat Grant.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    water, no matter what took place nor how it ended. Watterson arrived before April 30, along with
                    other "prominent members of the press," including Reid, Bowles, and White.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Watterson wrote many years later that he had "resolved to go a little in advance to <placeName>

            <p>Generally speaking, the convention seemed to contain more cold fish than queer fish. Reporters noted

                    tried to overreach itself at this time. Journalists had been the mouthpieces of party hacks for a

                    the postwar liberal movements in both parties away from war issues and toward new ones. This Liberal
                    convention was a fruition of their labors. They had no intention of standing aside during its
                    meeting and letting the old party hacks dominate it, choose its platform and candidate on
                    consideration of politics rather than principle, and thus wreck all their endeavors. Also, they
                    would fight as the vanguard of a campaign against Grant. It remained to be seen whether they
                    possessed sufficient political sophistication to manipulate effectively the wires in the show versus
                    seasoned politicians. They possessed a great weapon, if they knew how to use it, and that was the

            <p>Watterson was the only Democrat in the group and enjoyed great importance as the representative of
                    both the Democratic party and the South. Being only thirty-two, he was younger than the others, both
                    in editorial experience and in age. The <placeName>

                    "center figure of the group," surrounded by "its other members." This was a wise
                    movement on the part of Grant supporters; it was designed to indicate to the regular Republicans
                    that this group, as well as most of the rest of the convention, was heretical. Other papers did not
                    place Watterson above the rest in importance; occasionally a paper did not even mention him.</p>

                    </placeName> convention's main purpose in life was to nominate a presidential candidate.
                    Its platform of tariff reform, civil service reform, and amnesty to the South was already understood
                    by the public and promised to give little trouble. The Quadrilateral addressed itself to this
                    problem as early as the night of April 29. Schurz, Bowles, Halstead, and Watterson favored Charles
                    F. Adams; White was for Lyman Trumbull; and Reid advocated Greeley. All agreed that the lucky man
                    must be distinguished for pure and upright political character as well as extraordinary ability.
                    They refused to be sidetracked by political considerations, dear to the heart of professional
                    politicians, such as availability and attraction to voters. Charles Francis Adams fulfilled this
                    bill to a "t," having been distinguished for his disdain<hi rend="sup">24</hi> of public
                    favor. He indicated his feeling for the Liberal movement by sailing away to Europe just before the
                    convention opened.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> One is mildly surprised that the genial and effervescent
                    Watterson supported a man of this type. He later confessed that he was not particularly devoted to

            <p>As Watterson was the only Democrat in the band, he played a muted trombone. His position was
                    decidedly ambiguous in the eyes of the straight-out members of both parties. He especially needed to
                    justify himself before his own party.</p>
            <p>His contribution to the broadside was that, of course, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> convention was "a Republican and not a Democratic gathering." Therefore, its
                    doings were "only interesting to us Democrats so far as they enable us to meet the liberalism of the
                    country on an equal footing for the purpose of genuine reform and union. From this standpoint,
                    however, we sincerely wish it well." Warily approaching the business of the hour, he
                    charged that "certain well-known Republican wire-pullers" were trying to push through "certain
                    pre-arranged combinations." He never felt strong enough to mention Davis' name, leaving his
                    readers to learn the culprits from the Republican newspapers. For the benefit of his Democratic
                    audience, he was ignoring the fact that most of Davis' support came from Democratic politicians.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a tone of entirely unaccustomed moderation for Watterson. His timidity must have been due to
                    the difficulty of his position before his own party. The public response was evidently sufficient to
                    embolden him to explain the next day what he had meant the day before. Now he thundered against "the
                    already shop-worn candidacy of Davis" in quite his usual style. He made so bold as to speak for the
                    Democratic party and announced that "if we are to be beaten, we prefer to go down head and tail
                    erect, with our colors flying."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Decidedly feeling his oats, he
                    offered the Liberal press the advice that the Liberal movement could not stand without their support
                    "and as far as we are concerned, we decline to prop it by a one-legged Democratic
                    boosting." The Democrats could support it only if it found a candidate who could split the

                    provoked controversy. This was a mass convention. Its delegates were not chosen in any regular way;
                    many of them simply appointed themselves. It was decided that the men from each state would get
                    together and choose its official delegates. This method did not represent the popular strength of
                    the group and gave rise to charges of bulldozing and packing.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>Carl Schurz was elected permanent chairman. Although all conceded him to be the leading spirit of the
                    movement, many observers felt that he could have worked more effectively behind the scenes.
                    Watterson listened enraptured, saying, "Who that was there will ever forget his opening words: 'this
                    is a moving day.' "<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Schurz discussed the pure and lofty aspirations of the
                    movement and the country's need for reform. He mentioned amnesty for the South and the need
                    for sectional reconciliation. When Schurz specified that the candidate chosen must be of "superior
                    intelligence, coupled with superior virtue," no one doubted that he referred to Adams.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Enthusiasm mounted in this staid, though eccentric, gathering. For two days
                    and a night and a half, the Quadrilateral had the world in a sling and things its own way.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The convention quickly adopted for its platform the well-known Liberal principles of civil service
                    reform, amnesty to the South, and acceptance of the three wartime amendments. It ran into a snag,
                    however, over the tariff question. David A. Wells and many North westerners wanted free trade;
                    Greeley's supporters wanted protection. They compromised by agreeing to leave the question
                    up to Congress.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Such wrangling delayed the balloting until Friday, May 3. This
                    revived the Adams' candidacy. It had been riding high on Wednesday after the Davis fiasco and

            <p>Where was the Democratic member of the Quadrilateral at this crisis? The stage was all set for a
                    dramatic, last-minute rescue but Watterson missed his cue. He explained, later, that his business as
                    editor of a morning daily, made him something of a night owl and unable to go to bed "before the
                    presses began to thunder below" for the morning <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal.</hi> This unfortunate
                    habit made him a prey to temptation on Thursday night. At the solicitation of a "party of
                    Kentuckians, some of whom had come to back me and some to watch me," he went over the river
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to celebrate the triumph of principle over politics at the convention. The occasion was
                    sufficiently important to claim his attention "until the wee sma' hours ayont the twel."</p>
            <p>When he did reach his hotel, just before going to bed, he glanced at the early edition of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Commercial</hi> which contained Halstead's warning editorial. Watterson
                    noticed that "something-I was too tired to decipher precisely what-had happened." He was
                    unable to present himself at the convention hall until toward noon the next day. By that time, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Blair's work was over; their little scheme for nominating Greeley had been
                    put over and the convention was spiked. Watterson claimed later that he had in his possession
                    "documents which would have induced at least one of them to pause before making himself
                    conspicuous." The other members of the Quadrilateral knew that he had the documents but
                    were unable to find him. When Watterson reached the convention hall Friday morning, he had an "angry
                    collision" with either Blair or <placeName>

            <p>The scene at the convention hall the morning Watterson was absent was dramatic. It gave Adams a
                    56-vote lead over Greeley. At its close B. Gratz <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> asked permission to speak. Schurz was suspicious but a sense of fair play made him
                    reluctantly agree, in view of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s candidacy. So, "up the platform stairs slowly mounted Mr. B. Gratz <placeName>

                    Adams and Trumbull followers were too inept and too inexperienced to save the situation. Many
                    observers, including Watterson, believed that concerted action on the part of Adams and Trumbull
                    followers at this point would have carried the convention, but they waited too long.<hi rend="sup">72</hi>

                    and eccentric convention shouting itself hoarse. A gleeful Republican paper stuck on its front page

                    with the belief that I was taking the Quadrilateral into camp and should find them very useful

                    agreed to "begin such support in a mild form and by degrees grow warmer in the work."
                    Schurz was unable to make up his mind to support Greeley for several weeks, but finally came into

                    that he will not change his mind. Later, Watterson said that he took a day and a night to pull

            <p>Some disgruntled elements in the Liberal group had to be mollified in the next few weeks. Watterson
                    spoke of pulling himself together in a hurry in order to "plunge into the swim to help fetch the
                    water-logged factions ashore." Otherwise, he said, the Democrats would never support the
                    Liberals. Schurz was the hardest to deal with. According to Watterson, the Fifth Avenue Hotel
                    conference held by prominent Liberals in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    stream which flowed between his disappointed hopes and aims and what appeared to him an illogical
                    and repulsive alternative."<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Watterson invited Schurz to breakfast before the conference. He and Horace White also worked at
                    soothing David A. Wells' feelings. Watterson made a speech at the conference in favor of accepting
                        Greeley.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Schurz was so far won over that he made the closing speech,
                    clinching the acceptance of Greeley.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Watterson was happy to note that, contrary to the expectations of politicians and reformers, the
                    people rose to the nomination of Greeley. He laid this to "the sentimental, the fantastic and the
                    paradoxical in human nature." In the <list type="footnotes">

                    reconciliation. "Peace was the need, if not the longing of the Southern heart, and Greeley had been

            <p>What reputation Edward Eggleston enjoys today he owes almost exclusively to his first novel, <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster.</hi> That he was a pioneer in the writing of realistic,
                    regional literature is the single fact seized upon by historians of American culture. That his name
                    occupies a worthy place in the annals of our church history, that he founded the first Christian
                    Endeavor Society in America, that the growth of his mind in some respects may symbolize the growth
                    of the American mind from fundamentalism to free thinking in religion, that his aid in securing the
                    passage of an international copyright law was considerable, and that as a historian he enjoyed a
                    respectable and prominent place in his own day are facts lost sight of at the present time.</p>

                            was animated by a somewhat similar ideal, the material in Eggleston's volumes was
                            more philosophical, less political, better digested and more gracefully written.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Before examining his historical career, let us trace the earlier facts of Eggleston's life.

                    illness, but a diligent reading program in a library purchased under the wise direction of his
                    father served to give the boy no mean acquaintance with Virgil, Pope, Homer, Emerson, Theodore
                    Parker, and a score of others. Contrary to the opinion one receives from his novels of rude <list type="footnotes">

                    uncultivated one. His father, a lawyer, was an honor graduate of William and Mary, a member of both
                    houses of the Indiana legislature, and a Whig candidate for Congress.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> His
                    mother, Mary Jane Craig, was the daughter of an experimenter in improved agriculture, especially in
                    the breeding of new varieties of fruit trees. One of his teachers, Mrs. Julia Dumont, who had an
                    incalculable influence upon him, employed methods of pedagogy which might well shame progressive
                    educators. She was the author of poems, articles, and at least one book.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> A
                    debating club organized by Edward but discreetly steered by an older cousin, Guilford, was an
                    intellectual force of some moment. Eggleston's father died young, leaving his family an
                    income of $250 a year and directing that his law library be sold to purchase classical
                    books for his children. When he was sixteen, Edward spent a year in <placeName>

                    exhausted its well-stocked plantation library. In this manner he continued his studies in French,
                    Latin, Greek, and mathematics.</p>

                    appointment to the next, he managed to do a considerable amount of reading which ripened his
                    understanding. In 1868 he was ready to accept a post as editor of <hi rend="i">The Little

            <p>His reputation was still to be made, however, for he had written nothing of note except the popular
                    "Chicken Little" stories for children.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In the summer of 1871 with his brother,
                    George Cary, he took over the moribund <hi rend="i">Hearth and Home,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>added to its contributors a list of distinguished writers, and composed seriatim, "The

            <p>This popular success was partly to be explained by a Dickensian humor and pathos but still more by
                    the fact that it was a new departure in American letters. What Ralph Waldo Emerson had, in the year
                    of Eggleston's birth, asked for in "The American Scholar" was at last coming to pass:
                    American writers were turning to American themes and American scenes. Bret Harte had anticipated
                    Eggleston by two years in the use of local color, but the fact that the latter had probably never
                    read Harte, coupled with his avowal of indebtedness to Hippolyte A. Taine's "Art in the

               <hi rend="sup">11</hi> In the writing of history his aim was the same as in writing imaginative literature. He
                    wished to depict the actual life of the people with a realism based upon a fidelity to detail. Life
                    in Indiana had furnished the material for the one sort of writing; life in the libraries of two
                    continents had to furnish the material for the other. A respect for primary sources which almost
                    amounted to awe and an undisciplined intellectual curiosity which led him astray into many
                    interesting but extraneous fields slowed his work. The transition from the art of fiction to the
                    scientific aspects of history was apparently not an easy one for him to make.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    During the score of years given over to history, he published, in addition to the two major works, a
                    number of school histories in which his purpose of a realistic brushing away of the cobwebs of
                    sentimentalism and misguided patriotism prevailed. He also delivered lectures at <placeName>

                        <p>It has been my aim to make these pages reflect the character of the age in which the English
                            colonies were begun, and the traits of the colonists, and to bring into relief the social,
                            political, intellectual, and religious forces that promoted emigration. This does not
                            pretend to be the usual account of all the events attending early colonization; it is rather
                            a history in which the succession of cause and effect is the main topic-a history of the
                            dynamics of colony-planting in the first half of the seventeenth century .... I have
                            disregarded that convention which makes it obligatory for a writer of American history to
                            explain that intolerance in the first settlers was not just like other intolerance, and that
                            their cruelty and injustice were justifiable under the circumstances. This walking backward
                            to throw a mantle over the nakedness of ancestors may be admirable as an example of diluvian
                            piety, but it is none the less reprehensible in the writing of history .... Literary
                            considerations should have some weight in deciding how fully an episode shall be treated,
                            unless the historian is content to perform the homely service of purveyor of the crude ore
                            of knowledge. I have sought to make this "a work of art as well as of historical
                            science," to borrow a phrase from Augustin Thierry.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>With such a beginning he moved ahead with his story, but he did not give as complete a picture as one
                    might wish, though he excused himself from that duty. He wrote, however, with an unusualness of
                    detail, a felicity of style, and a clarity of method which call forth admiration. The construction
                    of the book is delightful and helpful; large print and a generous margin at the open side of the

                    end of the chapter in sections called "Elucidations." These bibliographical notes, often
                    running to several pages, attest to unremitting pains for accuracy, revisions of opinion as his

            <p>It may be noted that he displayed a tendency toward generalization. He wrote: "Not religious

                    of life, in the winter migration of birds to distant planets, in devils, and in witchcraft. His
                    attitude was critically expository; he did not seek to "debunk." If the work is
                    iconoclastic to some, he did not assume the feigned superiority of the iconoclast. This is
                    straight-forward reporting.</p>
            <p>The chapter on "Mother English, Folk-Lore, and Literature" attests the interests of the man of
                    letters, the student of languages, and the dialect novelist.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The product of
                    long study, his research into the transit of language to America is replete with interesting
                    illustration. In general he found that "Americanisms," our "rustic words and
                    accents," are English in origin and have undergone environmental change. A people of little
                    education finds a substitute in proverbs and folklore. The nature of these continental and English
                    predecessors was shown by Eggleston. The importance of such attention by a historian was explained:
                    "To call such surviving mediaeval and ancient beliefs quite useless would be rash; they at least
                    supplied material to the imagination and rudely served as substitute for literature."<hi rend="sup">25 Indeed, his treatment of the literature of the common people is abler than that
                        which is usually dignified as early American literature. Adopting an attitude more prevalent in
                        his time than in our own, he wrote, "Nothing that can properly be called American
                        literature was produced in the colonies in the early seventeenth century-nothing worthy of the
                        name in its later time." He dismissed charmingly</hi>

                    chapter. one might mention, are seventeen pages in small print of bibliographical notes.</p>
            <p>The volume ends with the close of the seventeenth century. On the whole it is more valuable, more
                    usable at the present day, and more adequate within its sphere than the first volume. The initial
                    work is to a greater degree the orthodox story-the colonization. Better syntheses and
                    interpretations have succeeded it. But the story of the transit of civilization is less well
                    studied. What Eggleston included in this work has thus not been outmoded by more recent research.
                    The history of the Carolinas and Pennsylvania was ignored, but this was intentional. He purposed to
                    reserve their short histories in the seventeenth century for fuller treatment in a subsequent study.</p>
            <p>In his review of this work, Professor Charles M. Andrews made some trenchant and severe criticisms.
                    He complained of a lack of thoroughness, of a lack of sympathy with the ideas and opinions of the
                    seventeenth century, and of a neglect of the research done in the field since 1890.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    this work fairly. In the first place it should be noted that he was profoundly dissatisfied with the
                    book. In 1899 he suffered a stroke of apoplexy, which blinded him in one eye for a time, and which
                    was followed by a steady decline in health. Fearing death, which came in 1902, he published his book
                    prematurely. Secondly, it should be emphasized that he was a pioneer in history as well as
                    literature. Here was a man writing "the new history," coming after McMaster to be sure, but
                    preceding James Harvey Robinson and his school's emphasis upon that shibboleth. Andrews
                    himself did not publish his <hi rend="i">Colonial Folkways</hi> until 1919, eighteen years later;
                    and this did not confine itself to the small compass of the seventeenth century that Eggleston set
                    for himself but strode hastily over a much larger area.</p>
            <p>The year 1901 marked the publication of this volume and was the apex of Eggleston's career
                    as a historian. In spite of his infirm health, he served as president of the American Historical
                    Association from 1899 to 1900. His presidential address was characteristically entitled "The New
                    History." It was an eloquent plea for "cultural history," which is neither all
                    politics nor all war. "The main object of teaching history," he wrote with an ethical
                    stress which is reminiscent of the minister, "is to make good men and women, cultivated and
                    broad men and women."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The entire discourse was informed with a
                    catholic outlook and a tolerant understanding. The writer was an apostle of the new order, a pioneer
                    in the literary-scientific school of historiography.</p>
            <p>It was Edward Eggleston's misfortune, when one considers his reputation as a historian, to
                    die before the completion of his projected <hi rend="i">History of Life in the <placeName>

                    of his production. Two slight volumes are not sufficient supports for a great reputation. A second
                    circumstance, however, enters in to explain his present position. He was part of a stream of
                    influence, in his time a <list type="footnotes">

                    historical thought. Greater exponents of the new history succeeded him, towering above them the
                    figure of James Harvey Robinson, so that he was swallowed up in a mighty torrent. The importance of
                    the pioneer has not yet been generally appreciated.</p>

            <p>At the home of Henry Vanderburgh, the board had its third and final sitting of the year, and

            <p>Isaac Westfall took the place of Joshua Harbin at the first meeting for 1798, which was held at the
                    court house on February 3. Leech was again named assessor, as well as clerk. County expenses were
                    mounting terrifically, and the budget appropriation measure showed that for 1798 a 40-per-cent
                    increase of the appropriate total had to be authorized. This was an increase of $100 over
                    the 1797 total of $250, which brough the sum to $350 for 1798. Adopted, it was

            <p>While the repair of the court house and jail was kept at the same figure of $80 for the
                    year, the increasing cost of "Wolves, foxes, and wild Cats" jumped from
                    $40 in 1797 to $60 in 1798. These animals brough fifty cents per head with the
                    head as necessary evidence before the claim could be filed. The salary appropriation for the supreme
                    judges and the attorney general was slashed from $50 to $40, and the
                    deficiencies carried over from 1797 went down from $80 in 1796 to $20 in 1798.
                    Another item crept in, however &#151;"Debts owe by the County"&#151; to
                    the appalling sum of $150; that was the direct cause for the increase in the budget,
                    which the commissioners undoubtedly had to explain to their constituent taxpayers that year.</p>
            <p>Beckes concluded his duties as collector of taxes in 1797; and at the second sitting of the 1798
                    board, Jonathan Conger, a constable of the township, was appointed collector of assessments, and the
                    duplicates were ordered delivered to him. <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-040-4-040"/> Whether or not his
                    police powers qualified him as an effective collector to the board is not set down in the record.</p>
            <p>The record of the sitting on June 14 states that Constable Conger "hath accepted appointment and
                    refuses to discharge the duties thereof, whereupon the Board ordered that he be fined the sum of
                    Five Dollars to the use of the county." Henry Pea was thereupon named collector, and the
                    duplicates were shifted to Collector Pea. There were no appeals from the assessment hearing at the
                    July 29 meeting and the duplicates, amounting to $307.38, were closed. Comparison with
                    the appropriations total of $350 adopted earlier in the year indicates that even the
                    tax-levying bodies of over a century ago had their budget-balancing difficulties.</p>
            <p>At the annual meeting of the board, February 25, 1799, Father Jean Rivet appeared as a new member. He
                    was a Catholic missionary who was sent to this western country and who is reputed to have opened the
                    first free school in this vast area. Isaac Westfall was the second member and William Mcintosh, who
                    acted as clerk, the third.</p>
            <p>Difficulties faced the board. Henry Pea had not refused the job of collector but had made absolutely
                    no accounting of the tax moneys charged to him. The board ordered Mcintosh to signify to Collector
                    Pea in writing <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>that the Treasurer hath complained that he had not paid the sum of money he was charged to
                            collect, and that unless he do forthwith comply with, his duties in that respect, that a
                            warrant shall be issued against him for neglect. Appointed Isaac Decker of <geogName>White

            <p>On March 2, 1799, the board met "according to adjournment" at the home of Father Rivet. Faced with
                    the difficulties of not having any tax money in the treasury from the year 1798, its important duty
                    was to adopt an appropriation budget for the year 1799. Repair of the court house and jail dropped
                    from $80 to $15, and the item for the bounty on "Wolves, Foxes and wild Cats"
                    was stricken off entirely. The salary of the Supreme Court judges and the attorney general, reduced
                    the year before to $40, was restored to $50, and the item for county debts was
                    slashed to $80 from $150. This showed a total appropriation <pb n="357" id="VAA4025-040-4-041"/> of $145 for the year 1799, as compared to $350
                    for 1798. Exigencies provided the ax.</p>
            <p>Isaac Decker was directed to receive the assessment list for 1799, which amounted to
                    $356.41, but Decker balked at his assignment and was promptly fined $5. The
                    board further added teeth to its order: "that if he refuses to pay the said Five Dollars on
                    demand to be made by the collector to be appointed, that a warrant shall issue as directed by law to
                    compel him."</p>
            <p>Samuel Gregory was elected collector. He refused and was fined $5, and Joseph Baird
                    received a call on June 26. The board received no further consideration from Baird, and they fined
                    him $5 and named Frederick Berger. On July 2 Berger prayed that he be relieved as "he
                    does not read and write the English language sufficiently to perform the duties and also that he has
                    been Constable. Whereupon ordered his resignation be accepted." It was evident that the
                    English language was not a qualification for the office of constable of the township at that time.</p>
            <p>So at the seventh sitting of the board, John Harbin was named, but at the next meeting on July 13,
                    Harbin resigned. Without any 1798 tax money and no collector for 1799, the board was getting
                    desperate. Harbin's fine was therefore doubled to $10 as a warning to others who
                    might be appointed. Patrick Simpson was named. Simpson was late of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName> and a man whose fighting qualities went farther than his inhibitive characteristics, as
                    the court record of fines paid for "rioting" revealed, and likely qualified him as an excellent man
                    to collect the taxes. The board, however, was again to be disappointed, and Simpson drew a
                    $10 fine at the ninth sitting on July 15. Three days later Abraham Decker was named, but
                    he, too, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>prayed he might be relieved from acting as collector, because he could not write. On the
                            question, whether it should be sufficient cause to save his fine, the board (two sitting)
                            divided in opinion, and referred the matter to be discussed in the present of other
                            Commissioner, and the Assessor at the first meeting.</p>

            <p>Philip Catt was named the following day, but he, too, pleaded his inability to read or write. Three
                    days later Joseph Decker was appointed and he also refused. The board was faced with a mutinous
                    situation and decided to double once more the fine, and Decker's fine was boosted to <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-040-4-042"/> $20. Thomas <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>

                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> declined, was fined $20, and Ephraim <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> was named.</p>
            <p>Collection of fines, it would seem, was at least creating a source of revenue to offset the 1798
                    deficit, provided that they could be collected. The fact remained that each succeeding collector was
                    the person who was expected to extract the penalty so that he was faced with the duty of levying on
                    an increasing number of his friends.</p>
            <p>Appeal day, August 3, rolled around; but Collector <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> failed to appear with the duplicate so tax abatements could not be made. Three days
                    later <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> appeared and said the duplicate had not come to his hand until August 2, and
                    furthermore that "he would not accept the appointment of Collector, his private concerns not
                    permitting him." He, too, was fined $20. Father Rivet stepped out from the board
                    at this session, and General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Johnston) took his place and was named clerk.</p>
            <p>On August 28 the first action of the new board was to name Noah Purcell collector, and on September
                    10, "appeal day," he refused the appointment. Once more the board decided to
                    increase the "ante" and Purcell was given a fine of $30. General Johnston was making his
                    presence felt, and this session also took note that Pea, collector for 1798, had still failed to
                    turn over the tax collections, so a warrant was ordered requiring <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>the Sheriff to take the body and seize and secure the estate real and personal belonging to

            <p>The eighteenth century went out without a tax collector, and for two years the county was without its
                    tax income. On January 18, 1800, John Ochiltree was named collector for the year 1799. One week
                    later the board met again and Ochiltree resigned; the board, however, was of the opinion "that said
                    collector do continue the collection." At this same meeting the sheriff returned the
                    precept against Pea, and with the sheriff was the former collector himself. He desired a continuance
                    of his case until January 28. The following day Pea appeared and asked for a general meeting <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-040-4-043"/> of the board to be held February 4 open to the public. At this
                    meeting Pea showed that he had collected a part of the sum with which he was charged but that there
                    was still $85,581/2 outstanding. The board ordered a writ of execution to the sheriff to
                    sell "so much of the property of the said Pea as shall be sufficient to pay the sum of
                    $85.581/2." The board also ordered Pea to act as collector of the balance of the
                    1798 taxes, and pay into the treasury any sums he might procure.</p>
            <p>On February 15, 1800, Abraham Decker came before the board and showed that his resignation of July
                    18, 1799, had not yet been adjudicated and asked for a general meeting of the board which the public
                    could attend. It was declared an open meeting forthwith, and Decker was fined $10. Philip
                    Catt, Decker's successor who had likewise refused, was given a similar fine.</p>
            <p>On July 19, the record reveals that Wyant, sheriff, reported to the board that Pea had made another
                    partial payment of his delinquencies in the sum of $46.50 and the sheriff was ordered to
                    receipt Pea therefor, leaving the balance of $39.0814 outstanding. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Henry Pea as a delinquent Collector for the year 1799, was on the 4th instant fined by the

                            delinquencies. And was ordered also to collect the balance of the said duplicate, being

            <p>The only business of the new board was to consider a bill for services filed by the former Sheriff

                    authenticated and ordered that the "applicant do receipt the same, and thereon the same is done

                    time fixed July 11 as the appeal day for the tax assessments filed by the constables. This meeting
                    was a significant one, also, for General Johnston was appointed "as Secretary of this Board invested

            <p>Whether or not Isaac White bid for the job the record fails to say, but on August 15 White was
                    appointed and presented his bond before Commissioners Leech, Claypoole, and Johnston, with the first
                    two as his sureties. No appeal day having been had on the assessment, the board set September 11 for
                    such a hearing because of "erroneous returns of people and property made by the
                    Constables," and the record indicates the following "amendments and deductions" were
                    allowed as "delinquencies" in the settlement of White's accounts to the commissioners.</p>

                    but it is not in Wilkinson's writing.) It is a map made in approximately 1792 and shows
                    Fort Jefferson, Greenville, Fort Recovery, streams, roads cut by the army, Indian paths and
                    villages, and Harmar's route.</p>
            <p>A pen and ink plan for a battle which shows deployed formation of various battalions has been
                    identified as an arrangement of troops by General St. Clair when he was attacked and defeated by the
                    Indians November 4, 1791, near the present site of Fort Recovery, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            <p>A notation on two sketches states they were enclosed in a letter of General Wilkinson, November 6,
                    1792. Wilkinson was then in charge of the army in the Northwest and reported an attack of Indians
                    earlier in the day on a group of militia camped outside Fort St. Clair near the present Eaton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. One sketch shows Fort St. Clair and its surroundings at the time of this attack. An
                    outline of the fort, the course of a neighboring creek, the militia camp, pack horses and attacking
                    savages are indicated.</p>
            <p>The other sketch is labeled "South perspective of Fort Jefferson" and, although marked on the back
                    "Fort St. Clair," is more likely a drawing of the former. It shows an arrangement of
                    blockhouses and stockades quite unlike the usual rectangular form. Two blockhouses, a bullock pen,
                    two gardens, a forage magazine, and a larger unidentified building with cupola are strung out along
                    what appears to be the edge of a bluff with stockades of varying heights to protect the south
                    approach. Fort Jefferson is about six miles south of Greenville; it was built in the fall of 1791 by
                    St. Clair and was used in succeeding years as one of the protecting chain of forts and as a supply
                    depot.</p>

                        <p>The first night we stoped at the Lazaretto, it not being convenient to go to the
                                    City, to see our Friends, as we had anticipated, &amp; being crowded with the
                                    additional Troops we were obliged to put up with any accommodations we could get,
                                    &amp; for the first time in our lives, Abby &amp; myself reposed or rather
                                    tried to repose on the floor of Doctor Heilimans Parlor with a Blanket &amp;
                                    pillow, this felt rather hard to those who had been accustomed always to a soft bed,
                                    but I was <hi rend="i">young</hi> then &amp;, blest with a share of health,
                                    spirits, &amp; enthusiasm which made me surmount many difficulties. The next
                                    morning we went to the beautiful City Phillm which I had long wish'd to behold,
                                    &amp; was received by our Dear Cousin Penroses, with all that cordialaty which
                                    we desired &amp; expected, they did all they could to make our time pass
                                    pleasantly, &amp; profitably, the time flew very swiftly, &amp; the Period,
                                    too soon arrived, when we must be seperated, from our Dear Sister, &amp; Cousin.
                                    The remembrance of those days, will ever be retain'd by me, they were among the few,
                                    White days, which fall to the Lot of man. I never saw these dear Cousins again for
                                    they paid the debt of nature a few years after, Uncle B saw them once or twice after
                                    we were there together. Among many things worthy of observation was the Penia
                                    Hospital founded by William Penn. Cousin William was one of the managers, &amp;

                                    Myselfe went in the Stage, under the care of a Nephew of the Cols, who was
                                    travelling with us for his health, the weather was serene, the roads good, all
                                    nature appeared in its richest dress. the Land from Philm to Chambersburg, which is
                                    at the foot of the Alleghany Mountains, is rich &amp; highly cultivated, large
                                    farms with Barns of spacious dimensions built of stone, meet the eye in all
                                    directions, &amp; what particularly attracted our attention was the Hogs up to
                                    their backs feeding in rich clover, &amp; the Dutch Girls working in the fields
                                    performing the labour of Men. The Hogs appear'd the most favour'd. I had often heard
                                    the remarks of Pigs in Clover, &amp; here I saw it, realized.</p>
                        <p>Pittsburg June 26 We arrived here 10 days since after a tedious yet delightful
                                    journey, tedious in consequence of the extreme roughness of the road, but rendered
                                    delightful by the beauty of the surrounding landscap. On every side was exhibited,
                                    to our admiring eyes, a constant succession, of scenery, at once <hi rend="i">grand,
                                        sublime, awful &amp; sweet.</hi> A variety of emotions, fill my mind, at the
                                    survey of God works, everything is calculated, for our instruction, comfort,
                                    &amp; pleasure, &amp; while we contemplate the wonderful variety, of naturs
                                    works, our dependence on the Author, is more firmly fixed in our hearts, could we be
                                    sensible of our obligation to him, &amp; of his goodness to us, we should not
                                    let a murmuring thought arise, but be wholy resigned, to his will, &amp;
                                    pleasure, what ever that should be.</p>
                        <p>The Stages were very bad, obliged to walk the horses up the Mountains several miles
                                    together, &amp; sometimes for a change we would all get out, &amp; walk
                                    ourselves, at one time the seats were taken out, plenty of straw put in the Dottom
                                    of the Stage, &amp; the Passingers stowed in, like baggage. This did very well
                                    for a little while, but to those who wish'd to view, the landscape, as we passed
                                    along, it soon became wearisome, &amp; we concluded we should rather endure the
                                    pounding than be deprived of this pleasure, just imagine, to yourselfe, Lydia,
                                    seated on one side of stage, for the benefit of the view, holding on with both
                                    hands, exerting every nerve to maintain my Equilibrium, on one side of me, my
                                    neighbours elbow pushing in to my side, on the other, the side of the stage which
                                    was not stuffed, rubing against me, till I was black &amp; blue, &amp; then
                                    bounce would go my poor head, against the top of the Stage, till my brains were
                                    ready to fly. but all this, I could bear, for the sake of beholding, the scenery. at
                                    a distance the Mountains would tower to the clouds, on our side &amp; within a
                                    foot or two of the Carraige wheels, an awful precipice, at <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-040-4-056"/> whose base a beautiful river, glided along, unmindfull
                                    alike of the danger, or admiration, of. the beholder, after a little, we would ride
                                    through this stream, or cross a rude Bridge thrown over it, then again we would see
                                    it at a distance, we were obliged to lock the wheels decending the Mountains,
                                    &amp; when we came to a very narrow place, the driver would sound a tin horn to
                                    warn any who might be approaching to stop in a safe place till we passed. It is 160
                                    miles across these Mountains the way we went, which took us several days to
                                    accomplish, there are some pretty &amp; thrifty Villages among the Mountains, we
                                    stoped at several, but the one which attracted my attention most, was called <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                                    </placeName> we lodged there the second night, it was situated in a beautiful Valley
                                    watered by a very lovely stream called the Junitta [Juniata], it reminded me of
                                    Johnsons Eassellas [Rasselas], who was born &amp; educated, in a similar valley,
                                    surrounded so entirely by mountains, that he lived, to the age, of man, ere he
                                    learnt, there was any other world, beside the spot he inhabited, &amp; then
                                    prompted by curiosity he climbed, one of the mountains, when <hi rend="i">lo,</hi>
                                    another world, burst upon his view, which he explored, but return'd, (if I recollt
                                    fight) not much delighted, with his discovery.</p>
                        <p>Pittsburg is a pleasant Village surrounded by Mountains. On one side, the Monongahala
                                    [Monongahela] river, laves its banks, on the other the pure Waters of the Alleghany
                                    unite &amp; mingle with the Majestic &amp; beautiful <hi rend="i">
                                        <placeName>
                                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                                    </hi> This Village is famed for its manufactories, the people appear very
                                    industrious &amp; engrossed with the all important business of accumulating
                                    wealth, coal is used here which gives the Village a very dirty appearance, &amp;
                                    the Children appear neglected, we visited Grants Hill a place, rendered conspicious,
                                    and not so much from the loftiness of its summit as from having been the scene of
                                    Battle between the enemy &amp; our people in the old War. we have visited, a
                                    number of Factorys, &amp; a large flour Mill, which are worth seeing, saw them
                                    blow Glass at the Factory, also saw some cut glass, the first I ever saw
                                    manufactured in our own country. The first steam boat, ever built on these Western
                                    Waters, is now on the stocks, &amp; will soon be launched, if it were ready now,
                                    we might have the pleasure of going in her. had a terrible thunder gust to day the
                                    thunder was tremendous, accompanied with vivid lightining, &amp; rain, which
                                    drenched the street like a flood, the Thunder is always more violent among the
                                    mountains than in a level country, the heat is oppressive but does not make me sick,
                                    all kinds of provision is cheap &amp; of a good quality.</p>
                        <p>The Military Quarters are small &amp; do not accommodate all our Regiment, the
                                    Col with his staf reside at the quarters, while the rest of us board out, or live in
                                    hired houses, Leiut G &amp; wife with Husband &amp; myselfe &amp; some
                                    of our Brother Officers have hired a new Brick building in market Street &amp;
                                    have one table, Josiah provids &amp; I see that it is cook'd &amp; served up
                                    in proper order, which is not much trouble as we have plenty of servents &amp;
                                    those that are pretty good. The Military Quarters here resemble an elegant country
                                    Seat, they were built by General Wilkinson who no doubt you have heard of, in the
                                    rear of the house, which is commodious &amp; elegant, is a large Garden,
                                    arranged with much taste, all kinds of Fruit trees, shrubbery, &amp; flowers,
                                        <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-040-4-057"/> regale the eye, &amp; please the
                                    palate, while the odours which is emitted from the whole, leave nothing wanting
                                    which a person of tast could desire. A Canal runs thro the grounds, over which is a
                                    Chinese bridge, with seats round, &amp; about it. the Col has tea parties
                                    frequently, &amp; entertains his company, in the Garden while the Band plays at
                                    a distance hid from our view. I was highly entertain'd, the other day at one of
                                    these Parties. I was siting on the bridge, under the shade of some beautiful trees,
                                    conversing with some of the companey, when casting my eye into a walk at a little
                                    distance, I saw our gallant Col on his knee presenting a glove to a beautiful
                                    damsel, which she had let fall (perhaps on purpose) you recollect he is 50, she I
                                    presume was 16. the inhabitants treat us with every attention, our next door
                                    neighbours are Irish, we find them all we could wish, they are extremly kind
                                    &amp; attentive, they have a family of little Children one of whom is quit a pet
                                    with Josiah. Mr. Richardson has a great desire that Josiah should leave the Army
                                    &amp; settle here.</p>
                        <p>July 27 Since writting the above, we have received Orders to go to
                                            <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                                    </placeName> river, its 500, miles from this place. We go in keel boats covered like
                                    Houses, &amp; stope at night if we like, the river is narrow, in most places you
                                    can call across &amp; be heard quit plain. We are told it is very pleasant going
                                    down the River, but we should prefer stoping here, for the present, we are much
                                    pleased with the people, &amp; have just got comfortably fixed, but go we must,
                                    the Evenings here are delightful, after the excessive heat of the day. soon as the
                                    Sun retires, you see the inhabitants in the Streets, siting at their doors or
                                    walking with heads uncovered, that they may enjoy the soft breezes of twilight,
                                    sometimes Our Band of Music will play a part of the Eve, they take a Boat &amp;
                                    go up the rivers each side the Village, the Music has a fine effect among the
                                    Mountains, some beautiful Ec/ios. The whole together reminds me of something I have
                                    read but never expected to realize.</p>
                        <p>The cause of our proceding is this, the Indians are committing depradations upon the
                                    White inhabitants who are located on our Frontiers, &amp; the Govener of Indiana
                                    has requested some regular Troops to keep them quiet.</p>

                        <p>Embarked on board the Boats. The fleet (if I may so term it) consisted of 11 Boats.

                                    Custard Island, the ground not being good we sleep in the Boats, Cut a curious
                                    figure I assure you, we were obliged to put our beds on the floor of the Cabin,
                                    &amp; we females slept together, while our Husbands spread Blanketts on the
                                    seats on the sides of the Cabin which answer'd for Sophas &amp; chairs,
                                    &amp; thus enjoyed a comfortable repose, after the novelty of the scenic,
                                    situations, &amp; circumstances, allowed us composure, to court the drowsey God.</p>
                        <p>Mrs P &amp; her Husband are in another boat they have a small Cabin to
                                    themselves. We are as comfortable as if in a House, it is a very pleasant way of
                                    travelling we have our meals as regular as if in a Hotel.</p>

                        <p>We have just passed a small Villiage on the Banks of the river. it is very pretty,
                                    this is a beautiful River but extremely crooked, in some of the bend it appears as
                                    if we were enclosed in a Pond, &amp; I can not help the association in my mind
                                    of the Indians with their Tomahawks, &amp; scalping knives, peeping at us, from
                                    behind the bushes, &amp; yet Admiration &amp; astonishment seize the mind on
                                    beholding the wonderful works of an Almighty hand.</p>

                        <p>August 4th we were aroused this morning by the Drums beating the tune which
                                    accompanies these words, "Dont your hear your General say strike your Tents
                                    &amp; march away." Our Pilot has a Bugle Horn on which he plays some

                        <p>Our boat is 70 feet long, 12 wide, 7 high &amp; without Sails, it is propeled by

                        <p>1 oclock PM. Obliged to stop, Squal coming on, it-looks rather gloomy. It is past,
                                    and no damage done. We are under way again. 7. PM. It has been delightful weather
                                    since the shower. I wish you was with us, I can not express my feelings better than
                                    in these lines I have just been reading. "On such a blessed night as this I often

                                    in some of the principal Streets, indeed in some of them, there is hardly a foot
                                    path, it reminded us of Goldsmiths deserted Villiage. It is well laid out &amp;
                                    beautifully situated, I walk'd till fatigue compelled me to return to the Boat, then
                                    Josiah with some Brother Officers, went to examine some Indian Mounds, which were at

                        <p>The weather is unpleasant &amp; the rain prevents my going ashore on
                                    Blannerhassetts Island, which I regret excedingly, for it must be worth examining,

                        <p>On ascending the bank, from the landing, a quarter of a mile, below the eastern end,
                                    we entered a handsome double Gate, with hewn Stone Piliaster. A gravel walk lead us
                                    about 150 paces to the House, With a Meadow on the left a Shrubbery on the right,
                                    seperated by a low hedge of Privy Sally, thro which, innumerable Columbins,
                                    &amp; various, other hardy flowers were displaying, themselves, to the Sun. The
                                    House is handsome &amp; large, the Shrubbury, well stocked with flowering

                                    winding through it. the Garden is not large, but seems to have had, every delicacy,

                                    perhaps not exceeded for beauty in the world, it wants however, the variety of

                                    sever the Union, and was obliged to abscond from this charming retreat, at present
                                    its inhabitants are a few Slaves who raise hemp, the entrance is choked with bushes
                                    &amp; the whole has a romantic appearance.</p>
                        <p>The farther we procede down the river, the Country grows more cultivated, &amp;
                                    more level, we have almost lost sight of the Mountains.</p>

                                    </placeName> we became acquainted with a very interesting family by the name of

                                    passed in their society, when in the brilliant twilight, we seated ourselves on the

                                            </placeName>, Capt. and Mrs. Bacon formed the acquaintance of a family by
                                            the name of Taylor. The gentleman was a brother of General Taylor,
                                            afterwards President of the <placeName>
                                                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                            </placeName>. He owned a beautiful plantation a short distance from the
                                            military quarters, upon the bank of the river, and treated Mr. and Mrs. B.
                                            with the utmost attention and hospitality. He often sent them delicious
                                            fruit, aud <hi rend="i">[sic]</hi> frequently invited them to his house.
                                            Years afterward, Mrs. Bacon writes, 'Very pleasant is the recollection of
                                            the hours passed in their society. Sweet was our social converse when seated
                                            in the calm twilight, on the front piazza, overlooking the splendid lawn
                                            which spread its green carpet to the edge of the river. The; fruit trees on
                                            either side of the mansion were loaded with their rich treasures which not
                                            only delighted the eye but regaled the palate.'"</p>

                        <p>Last Might Our Boats were anchored under a very high bank whose Summit presented
                                    nothing very inviting, so much so, that we hardly thought of taking the trouble to
                                    ascend it, but our minds were soon changed by the report of some whose curiosity had
                                    led them to reconnoiter a little distance, they returned with some beautiful straw
                                    Hats, which they purchased of a Swiss family, whom they found settled a short
                                    distance from the River, About 30 families had taken up their residence here, being
                                    driven from their own country by the troubles in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> they fled to our peaceful shores, &amp; purchasing some land of
                                    Government have planted Vineyards, the produce of which, enables them to realize
                                    what they had fondly anticipated in an exchange of Countries, their Wine made from
                                    the Maderia &amp; Clarret Grapes is excellent. We purchased some. This place is
                                    called Veva, it is in New Swiss.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We went into one of the Vineyards, it was a delightful sight, the House appertaining
                                    to this Vineyard, was sweetly situated, the yard fronting the House was laid out
                                    with taste, we approached the House through rows of Grape vines, supported, by poles
                                    about 5 or 6 feet high loaded with ripe grapes. While the peach and nectrine trees
                                    swept the ground with their branches notwithstanding many had been proped up to
                                    prevent their breaking so loaded were they with the most delicious fruit, the family
                                    were dressed in their best, it being the Sabbath, a number of fine healthy Children
                                    ornamented, the yard, the Grass had been newly mown, &amp; perfumed the air with
                                    its fragrance, It was twilight, &amp; one of the most brilliant, I ever beheld,
                                    we tarried till the full Orbed Moon, arising in Mild Majesty, reminded us it was
                                    time to depart, which we did with much reluctance, &amp; like Our Mother Eve, on
                                    leaving Eden, we cast a long a lingering look behind. I had often read of such
                                    places, &amp; thought they existed only in the Authors brain, but my eyes have
                                    been gratified with a sight, equal to anything I ever read.</p>

                        <p>I am anxiously expecting news, from, My Dear Josiah, may he be protected from danger.</p>
                        <p>November 30th 1811 Still new mercies, call for our loudest, songs, of praise
                                    &amp; gratitude, to him, who is our constant Benefactor &amp; presever. My
                                    Husband has returned in safty after being exposed in the most horrid of all Battles,
                                    an Indian one, Oh my Mother, could I describe my feelings I would, but words cannot
                                    do it. I hope this great mercy may be a means, of raising my thoughts to God, who
                                    has watched over us ever since we have had a being, is it not strange that Beings so
                                    dependent should have so little Idea of their own weakness. We live, constantly
                                    recipients of the divine bounty, but it makes often no impression on our hard
                                    unfeeling hearts, could we be made sensible of our own frailty &amp; the
                                    immutability of him, who died for our redemption, we should be happy here &amp;
                                    hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I do not regret that Josiah was in this Battle, for I trust the kindness of God in
                                    thus sparing his life, has left impressions on his mind, that will not readily be
                                    effaced, His duty as Quarter Master is particularly ardious on a March, of course he
                                    was not attached to any company, but equally exposed to danger with those who were.

                                    attacked them a little before day which is their usual method. The Regular Troops
                                    not being accustomed to Indians &amp; being assured by Govr. H. that there was

                                    start, with their Weapons of War by their side. their slumbers not very sound you
                                    may well suppose. The Indians do not fire regularly like well traind troops, the

                                    had their faces painted black, as is their custome, this our troops could only see
                                    by the light caused by the flashing of the guns, &amp; this added to the
                                    tremendous war hoop with the groans of the wounded rendered the scene terrific
                                    endeed. our troops answered the war-Hoop with 3 cheers, the Battle lasted till day

                              <hi rend="sup">19</hi> The Prophet, a brother of the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh,
                                        preached against drunkenness, witches, and the type of civilization that the
                                        white men had brought to the frontier. Both he and Tecumseh urged the Indians to
                                        return to the customs of their forebears rather than adopt the white
                                        man's culture. Their influence on the Indians in the Indiana Territory,
                                        especially on those at the Prophet's Town, was believed by Governor
                                        Harrison and others to be in a large part responsible for the hostility and
                                        violation of treaties of the Indians in the area. The Battle of <placeName>
                                            <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                                        </placeName> resulted in the breaking up of the Indian settlement of
                                        Prophet's Town and a decline in the prestige and influence of the
                                        Prophet among the more important northwestern tribes. It temporarily relieved
                                        the frontier settlements from the threat of hostile Indians and defeated
                                        Tecumseh's plan.</item>

                        <p>We were very much alarmed the other night with a violent shock of an earth quake. We
                                    were awoke out of a sound sleep by the House shaking in a most strange maner, at
                                    first we could not imagine what it was, my first impression was that the Indians
                                    were trying to get into the house, for I never thought of an Earth quake, but we
                                    soon discovered what it was, it was truely alarming, they have continued since, some
                                    times two a day, a few chimineys have been thrown down &amp; the ceiling of some
                                    houses cracked considerably the feelings excited by them are different from any
                                    thing I ever experienced. The judgments that are abroad in the world all tend to
                                    shew us the falibility, of earthly enjoyments, &amp; the nescessity of religion,
                                    to make us happy, &amp; enable us to veiw these judgments, as we ought, how mild
                                    are they compared with what our sins deserve. Dear Abby youth is the time for
                                    preparation, Piety in youth is delightful, the Poet says, "religion never was
                                    designed to make our pleasures less."</p>
                        <p>I felt a little vexed, with those wives you mentioned, in your letter, who would
                                    prefer, staying at home, rather than suffer a little inconvenience, what did they
                                    get married for. <hi rend="i">Never, no never,</hi> for a single instant, have I
                                    been sorry that I came with mine, on the contrary, I feel grateful to him who is the
                                    Author of all our blessings, that I was enable to accompaney him, to take care of
                                    him when he is sick, &amp; to console him under the various ills incident to
                                    human nature, some might say this was enthusiasm, but I do think we have been
                                    married long enough to find out whether the attachment, that grow, with our growth,
                                    &amp; strengthed with our strength is real or imaginary.</p>

                        <p>There was an Indian Counsel here last week which curiosity prompted me to attend,

                    <p>"But anyone knows ef you got the clothes,</p>

                </quote>
            <p>James Whitcomb Riley wrote these somewhat prophetic lines when, literally speaking, he appeared in
                    country homespun of Hoosierdom. In this bibliography he acquires the dress, let us say, of the
                    aristocracy of letters. Some measurements had been taken for this new attire by Edmund H. Eitel in
                    the biographical edition of the poet's works in 1913, where more than fifty pages of
                    bibliographical notes appeared, and in Letters edited by William Lyon Phelps and published in 1930.
                    But years of cutting and fitting and stitching were still to be done, and it has been done. One
                    regrettable feature is that Mr. Russo did not live to see the work completed.</p>
            <p>This "formal" is beautifully and carefully tailored. The designers say that it follows in many
                    respects a conventional pattern. But what they do not say and what is distinctly observable is that,
                    formal though the dress may be, it has, through the understanding and devotion of those preparing
                    it, been made to accentuate the personality of the wearer. The pertinent question now arises, Does
                    the poet seem at home in the new outfit and in the aristocratic company to which it admits him?</p>
            <p>The bibliography of a literary man is a challenge to scholars, who either silently neglect the
                    subject of the work as unworthy of the effort that accompanies research or begin under the stimulus
                    of the work to look with interested and appraising eyes. I speak perhaps from a personal bias,
                    having cut my teeth on Riley books; but I sincerely believe that James Whitcomb Riley deserves that
                    study for which the bibliography prepares. Questions suggest themselves at once concerning the
                    poet's reading, his reception in foreign lands, his literary friendships, his reflection of
                    the literary taste of more than one generation of readers, his part in America's cultural
                    development. For he was part of a now well-recognized literary growth which, in the 60's,
                    70's, and 80's, provided the West and South a voice. Abraham Lincoln, John Hay,
                    Joaquin Miller, Edward Eggleston, Mark Twain, <pb n="388" id="VAA4025-040-4-072"/> Mary Murfree,
                    Joel Chandler Harris, and the humorists who made themselves heard above the din of war and the
                    confusion of reconstruction were part of that growth and voice. He shared with some of these an
                    interest in presenting a region with the color that dialect gives and perhaps justified the praise
                    of the scholar George Philip Krapp, "Probably the best known and best loved of all dialect
                    writers in America...." Though part of a growth or movement, he yet had something
                    distinctive to present: He understood the yearning of men and women in a rapidly industrializing
                    society-a yearning that at times amounted to nostalgia-for the simplicity of country places and
                    country ways. And Riley has literary significance, not only through his relationship to the West
                    that was becoming vocal, but also through his ties with the literary East, with both its elderly and
                    its youthful spokesmen. His "Raggedy Man," his "Hired Girl," his "Uncle
                    Sidney," and other character creations have contributed more than is generally realized to
                    the silent inculcation of true democratic faith through a certain inherent dignity and lovableness
                    that are not dependent on social position. <hi rend="i">A Bibliography of James Whitcomb Riley</hi>
                    will be an invaluable aid in the resolution of complexities that attend the study of a period of
                    cultural growth.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Russo, with the aid of the Lilly Endowment, Mr. J. K. Lilly, Jr., and the Indiana
                    Historical Society have met the requirements for the best bibliographer: accuracy, lucidity, and
                    honesty. They have shown painstaking care in tracing the stories and poems of Riley to the places of
                    their first appearance in print, in ferreting out ephemeral productions, in finding and identifying
                    all his books in which his prose and verse appeared for the first time, and in describing those
                    books. They have organized the materials with the collector, the librarian, the student, and the
                    general reader in mind: there are clearly defined divisions, arranged with a "well-proportioned
                    picture of Riley's published works" the goal; explanatory introductions to these divisions;
                    cross references; references to outside works that afford necessary enlightenment on many items; an
                    alphabetized list of the journals in which individual stories and poems were first printed; an index
                    of first lines of those writings not so indexed in the biographical edition; an alphabetized list of
                    poems that have appeared as sheet music; a selected <pb n="389" id="VAA4025-040-4-073"/> group of
                    books and articles containing biographical and critical comment; and, finally, a general index for
                    the entire volume. And promises are kept. The authors pretend not beyond what they have been able to
                    do. They have been careful to distinguish items that they have known of indirectly from those that
                    have actually passed under their eyes. According to a recent statement of Mrs. Russo, she kept in
                    mind while at the five-year labor the distinction once made by her uncle, Charles A. Beard, between
                        <hi rend="i">a</hi> bibliography and <hi rend="i">the</hi> bibliography, with the latter the
                    desired end.</p>
            <p>As I indicated earlier, the authors have made a bibliography that accentuates the personality of the
                    man studied. The book is attractively bound in brownish-gray cloth. In addition to title and
                    publisher the backstrip of green bears stamped in gilt four illustrations reminiscent of the poet
                    and his work: a child with a halo; one of the nine goblins of the back fence; a corn shock and
                    pumpkins; and a boy of "Noon-time, June-time," with fishing pole and bait can. Opposite the
                    title page of the book is a reproduction in color of a portrait of Riley by the Hoosier artist T. C.
                    Steele. And shedding suggestions of the life of Riley's day over lists of titles and
                    minutiae of collations are diverting hints of the Bowen-Merrill fire, the misdating of books by some
                    publishers to lessen postage cost, the "War of the Poets" in <placeName>

                    approaches are, like the poet, inviting and friendly.</p>

               <hi rend="i">An Economic History of the Indiana Oolitic Limestone Industry.</hi> By Joseph A.
                    Batchelor. Indiana Business Studies, No. 27. (<placeName>

            <p>Professor Batchelor's study "is the product of the cooperation of two century-old
                    neighbors-Indiana University and the Indiana limestone industry." It presents an over-all
                    delineation of the interaction of the diversity of problems <pb n="390" id="VAA4025-040-4-074"/>
                    that have marked the life of the latter. Hence it is primarily an economic treatise, rather than
                    either a biography of an industry or a history. It is written in narrative style, however, and from
                    a historical viewpoint. Professor Batchelor divides his account into five chronological periods,
                    each of which is subdivided into a topical treatment of the major problems.</p>
            <p>Many of the distinguishing qualities of American industry are revealed in miniature by a study of
                    Indiana oolitic limestone, found principally in Lawrence and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe counties</region>
                    </placeName>. "Illustrations are afforded of such features as financial manipulations, railway
                    rebates, the impact of technological innovations," and a wide variety of labor problems and
                    developments. The author likewise points out that this Hoosier industry has been characterized by
                    instability, overcapacity, price wars, sporadic efforts to establish prices, and occasional attempts
                    to differentiate a product which is "more homogeneous than... most raw materials." He
                    presents sufficient data to reach the conclusion that oolitic limestone has those qualities of
                    "workability, durability, strength, and pleasing appearance" which are considered prerequisites of a
                    satisfactory building material.</p>
            <p>The pioneer period of the industry lasted from 1827 to about 1870. Although oolitic limestone was
                    used in the construction of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, started in 1853, local markets featured this period. Professor Batchelor suggests four
                    causes for this situation: wood and brick were much cheaper than stone; railroad facilities were
                    inadequate; Niagara limestone, found among other places at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Paul</settlement>

                  <settlement type="city">Dayton</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, enjoyed the advantage of place utility over oolitic
                    limestone and a popularity which resulted from priority of discovery; and, last of all,
                    "the building cycle was in a declining phase from the early 1850's until
                    approximately 1865."</p>
            <p>During the period from 1871 to 1896 the fledgling quarry industry came of age, and cut stone mills
                    were introduced. A variety of influences affected the demand for building stone, of which technology
                    was a particularly significant one. It was the time of H. H. Richardson and the Romanesque revival
                    movement in architecture. Then, in the eighties, came the first of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> "skyscrapers," so constructed <pb n="391" id="VAA4025-040-4-075"/> that "the
                    walls became mere envelopes enclosing the space within," with structural steel and
                    reinforced concrete bearing the weight of the building. Mechanical innovations available to
                    contractors included steam hoisting engines, power excavating shovels, electric hoists, steel
                    derricks, and pneumatic riveters (1898). Quarrymen were offered larger facilities by the Monon, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and other railways. They profited particularly by the' substitution of machinery for
                    hand methods as a result of the introduction of several types of channeling machines, power drills,
                    steam derricks, and gang saws. The <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> fires of 1871 and 1872, respectively, led to a demand for less inflammable building
                    materials, a situation which facilitated the selling of limestone for the construction of such
                    public buildings as the Lawrence and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>
                    </placeName> courthouses, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago City</settlement>
                    </placeName> Hall, and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana state houses.</p>
            <p>The book abounds in statistics. The number of quarries increased from 16 in 1870 to 48 in 1895, while
                    the cubic feet of sales grew from 350,000 in 1877 to 5,500,000 in 1896. The number of employees
                    almost doubled, there being 871 in 1880 and 1,476 in 1896. In 1899 the value of the sales of Indiana
                    oolitic limestone was $1,400,854, constituting 27.8% of the total sales in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. During the next two decades there were only three years that the proportionate value
                    of Indiana oolitic limestone declined, the general tendency being to increase, reaching a mark of
                    79.2% in 1917 with a value more than twice as great as in 1899.</p>
            <p>Sales fluctuations in the period from 1897 to 1918 resulted from the amount of promotional activities
                    carried on by individuals, by Indiana Congressmen, and by such organizations as the Indiana
                    Limestone Quarrymen's Association and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Stone Club. Attention to the psychology of selling brought results; for example, grades
                    formerly known as "coarse" and "mixed" sold much better when renamed "rustic" and
                    "variegated."</p>
            <p>Railway developments during these years had two principal influences. Rivalry between carriers
                    (several of which were financially interested in stone companies) led to considerable expansion,
                    particularly when rebates could be obtained. The practice of charging the same rates for dressed and
                    rough stone encouraged many companies to operate both <pb n="392" id="VAA4025-040-4-076"/> cut stone
                    mills and quarries. The number of the latter actually decreased during this period from forty-three
                    to thirty-five, while the number of cut stone mills increased from ten to thirty-six. Hence,
                    Professor Batchelor describes it as a period of integration of quarries and cut stone mills. One of
                    the unfortunate results of this integration was the decrease in the effectiveness of the promotional
                    activities of cut stone firms outside Indiana.</p>
            <p>Trends which had been in progress prior to World War I continued into the postwar period, which was
                    characterized by price control from 1918 to 1925, by mergers from 1926 to 1929, and by the
                    development of an overcapacity which became almost disastrous. The total value of various kinds of
                    limestone sold by Indiana producers dropped from approximately eighteen million dollars in 1928 to
                    less than five million in 1933.</p>
            <p>The period from 1934 until 1941 was one of frustration for many companies. The outbreak of World War
                    II put an end, at least temporarily, to efforts of the industry to stage a comeback. Little
                    information is given, unfortunately, regarding the remarkable story of the conversion of the cut
                    stone mills for war production. This deficiency is being taken care of by a supplementary study now
                    in progress.</p>
            <p>In his final chapter the author notes that the decline of the limestone industry resulted largely
                    from "changing trends in building that favored substitute products, cheaper materials, or subsidized
                    local materials" and from price wars which arose because of excess capacity. He points out that in
                    order to escape the doldrums of the 1930's it will be necessary to reduce costs by
                    technological changes, to popularize stone for residential use, and to educate "architects,
                    contractors, and homeowners in the cheapest but most serviceable means of using stone." He
                    concludes that the degree to which such an enlarged market will prove profitable "will depend upon
                    the development of improved marketing methods, intelligent labor-management relations, and fairer
                    and more equitable competition among the operators."</p>
            <p>Space limitations prevent even the briefest of summaries of the author's excellent
                    discussion of such topics as business organization, price policies, profits, and labor problems
                    during the various periods. The book has a multiplicity of graphs and tables, but the absence of
                    pictures will <pb n="393" id="VAA4025-040-4-077"/> detract from its usefulness for laymen,
                    particularly if they reside outside the stone district. It is well annotated, with the footnotes
                    located for the convenience of the reader. Some ten pages are assigned to bibliography, the
                    arrangement of which, however, seems rather unorthodox. By and large the imperfections are minor.
                    Professor Batchelor has done an outstanding piece of work.</p>

            <p>The appearance of this volume completes the extensive and well-executed history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The period treated by Professor Roseboom is that of the Civil War-the years which led
                    to that memorable dispute, the struggle itself, and finally the recession of that conflict before
                    newer issues. The era was a significant one for it witnessed the disappearance of the old Union and
                    the development of a new nation, the decay of the canal system and the coming of the railroad, the
                    disintegration of the Whig party and the organization of the new Republican party. It saw the rise
                    of industrialization, urbanization, the mechanization of agriculture, educational changes, and the
                    beginnings of modern cultural developments.</p>
            <p>The reader may be surprised to find that the author opens the volume with a long survey of the rise
                    of manufactures and cities, of changes in agriculture and transportation, and of banking and
                    currency problems. From these he turns to "cultural strivings," "education, the professions
                    and the churches," and to the reform crusades for temperance, women's rights,
                    better conditions in prisons and welfare institutions, and for peace. In this manner he uses half of
                    his pages before getting to the political and sectional difficulties which are generally considered
                    to characterize the period and to be the causes of the Civil War. This first half is somewhat
                    factual and statistical and therefore does not make fascinating reading.</p>
            <p>An interesting and at times dramatic narrative runs through the second half of the book in which the
                    story of <pb n="394" id="VAA4025-040-4-078"/> political change and of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s part in the Civil War is told. It is not a belief in the greater
                    significance of political history that leads to the suggestion that a different arrangement of the
                    chapters would have made for greater interest. Certainly those parts of the economic and cultural
                    history reflecting the influence of the war might have been reserved for chapters near the end of
                    the volume. The style needs more sparkle. Sentences like the following are all too rare: "The
                    troopers who chased Morgan's raiders across southern Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> rode through miles of fried chicken and hot biscuits."</p>
            <p>One may wonder whether the author is consistent when he attributes conservativeness to the "dead hand
                    of frontier individualism" in one place (p. 118) and to "poverty and isolation" of the hill regions
                    in another (p. 127). The same criticism may be made in respect to the statement that the
                    constitution of 1851 "took no account of the changing economic life of the State" (p. 134), just
                    after describing anti-bank, anti-corporation, and taxation provisions. Is there a third
                    illustration? Clement L. Vallandigham is referred to in the statement (p. 407) : "His was
                    not the voice of the West but only of the lower <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> . . . ."
                    But "The chief centers of strength of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Copperheads lay in the . . . north central and northwest central parts of the State, a
                    conservative Democratic area. . . ." and "unlike Indiana and <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>'s southern counties, with a few exceptions. . . were Unionist
                    [p. 409]." One might also ask for some explanation of the "older churchless frontier" (p.
                    214). The careful reader who notices footnotes will be surprised at the few newspapers cited and a
                    comparatively extensive dependence upon secondary accounts as contrasted with original sources.
                    Robert S. Fletcher's <hi rend="i">A History of Oberlin College</hi> is a recent work of
                    excellent character which was not noticed in the citations.</p>
            <p>Many of these criticisms are items which may easily be counterbalanced by more numerous and more
                    important virtues. Certainly the work is superior to any previously published history of this period
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            <p>The story of a newspaper through a century must of necessity be a composite picture traced through
                    thousands of issues, each a faithful record of the life of a community at the end of a single day.
                    Just as a single issue of today's <placeName>

                    its files are bound up in infinite number the stories, the heartaches, the successes and the

            <p>Thomas Ewing Dabney's <hi rend="i">One Hundred Great Years</hi> is more than a history of
                    the Times-Picayune from its founding through 1940. It is the history of the nation's growth
                    through a dramatic century as reported in the newspaper's columns. Mr. Dabney's
                    scholarly background and his long training as a reporter are combined in a happy partnership to
                    produce a readable and delightful story based on long and painstaking research. Perhaps no other
                    writer has presented so clearly the contest for control of the city's destiny waged between
                    the old Creole French and the rising tide of Anglo Saxons following the <placeName>

            <p>While Mr. Dabney points out the significant contributions made by the Picayune's founders,
                    George Wilkins Kendall and Francis Asbury Lunsden, as well as Samuel F. Wilson, Page Baker, Pearl
                    Rivers and others whose names brought fame to the paper, he has rightfully discerned that a
                    newspaper actually is made by a great body of anonymous workers who toil day after day, almost
                    unknown to the public. It is to this group that he has dedicated his volume.</p>

            <p>Dr. Quaife, editor of the Series, naturally chose <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> as his own. Long
                    familiar with the documents, the people, and the region, the author has produced a happy combination
                    of solid history, travelogue, and inspirational description. Part one, "From Bark Canoe to
                    Steel Leviathan," establishes the historical background. "Black Robe and Red
                    Skin," "Dreamer of Empire," "Cities in Embryo," "Treason and Sin at Old
                    Mackinac," "Sturgeon Boats," "Wind against Steam" are representative chapters
                    which both suggest and deliver. In part two the "Talk of Many Things" ranges from an authentic
                    historical account of state boundary disputes to nineteenth-century community-utopia quests and the
                    Kingdom of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> Harbor. Part three escorts the reader around the coast; fruit, tulips, dunesland, the
                    Green Bay Road, and finally <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the "Eighth Wonder of the World," are stops on the itinerary.</p>
            <p>Treating as the author does, with topics of varying interest appeal, the writing presents, to the
                    reviewer at least, a delightful change of pace. Being a historian, Dr. Quaife realizes that people
                    who read this kind of book often want some meat as well as dessert. At times the reader finds
                    himself mentally filing away the location of rich lodes of useful factual and source material; at
                    others, chuckling over comedy low and high. Many shrewd observations and <pb n="397" id="VAA4025-040-4-081"/> reflections are interspersed in the text. Footnote references are
                    adequate to enable the reader to know where he is "at" at all times; the bibliography represents the
                    sifting of a specialist.</p>
            <p>Lake Superior-a great cold sea and a land of scenery, history, and romance. French discoverers, fur
                    traders, and missionaries, aided by the author, tell their own stories in part one-"Footprints on
                    the Sands of Time." Part two, "Vulcan's Shops and Neptune's
                    Realm," treats of transportation, iron, copper, fish, and lumber. In part three arise the
                    "Saintly Cities" of the Sault, the cities of the south shore, and the "Queens of the Unsalted
                    Sea"-Superior and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Duluth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The scenic drive of the north shore (one of the most beautiful in the world), Isle
                    Royale, Indian lore and its literature comprise parts four and five. Most sources are identified in
                    the text. The bibliographical note is brief but adequate.</p>
            <p>There is much history here, also much knowledge of lake fisheries and fishing, of lumber, mining,
                    ships, men, and processes; there are statistics even. Permeating all is a love of the land, nature,
                    and the great lake.</p>

                  <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> and Lake Superior</hi> are excellent examples of the
                    successful semi-popularization of history. When the literary artists attempt history, the result is
                    usually something more or less delectable-without much history. In these books the reader will find
                    a thrilling story, no less thrilling for its being true. For the student, historian, and lover of
                    the Middle West, a most important and lasting value is the introduction to the sources and
                    literature of the history of the lake region, often quoted, discussed and analyzed by the two
                    persons who know it best.</p>
            <p>Years ago Theodore Roosevelt said: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            prosperous commonwealths which go to make up the mightiest republic the world has ever seen.
                            These states. . . form the heart of the country geographically, and they will soon become
                            the heart in population and in political and social importance. . . I should be sorry to
                            think that before these states there loomed a future of material prosperity merely. I regard
                            this section of the country as the heart of true American sentiment.</p>

            <p>Others noted that the area would logically be the seat of American culture as well, a culture as
                    foreseen by the historian of a century ago, inspired by the momentous epochs of days gone by "to
                    which the human heart with its features and phenomena and the Godlike work of its improvement, adds
                    a permanent field of study and research." To this end the editor, authors, and publishers
                    of the American Lake Series are contributing their knowledge and their labors, the worthy products
                    of craftsmen.</p>
            <p>In material dress these books are war-time casualties-particularly so as regards the paper. Obviously
                    publication could not wait and the reader is the gainer on balance; he can travel vicariously
                    through time and space, on and around the Great Lakes-awaiting a day.</p>

                    World War II. Until the 1920's, the "only place on earth where pure native copper was found
                    in commercial quantities," the Copper Country was "discovered and rediscovered more times
                    than the North and South poles together." Less spectacular than silver, gold, or diamonds,
                    copper not only was of as great economic importance, but contributed its romance and human history
                    as well.</p>

                    the fascinating picture develops.</p>
            <p>The author has used the newspapers, the statistical reports company records, and the available
                    secondary literature <pb n="399" id="VAA4025-040-4-083"/> of the subject; he has counseled with
                    librarians and local historians. But above all, he has spent long hours profitably with the human
                    documents still extant. Footnotes are negligible and the bibliography is general. Though there are
                    some minor historical slips (p. 20, for instance), here is enough geology to satisfy all but the
                    geologist, enough history to satisfy all but the specialist, enough economics for all but the
                    statistically-minded brethren, and enough human interest for everybody.</p>
            <p>Mr. Murdoch would probably deny being a historianhe was associate editor of a trade journal and a
                    writer of travel bureau booklets-but he has an inquiring mind, patience, and a sincere interest in
                    his subject. He can turn a phrase without torturing a fact. <hi rend="i">Boom Copper</hi> is a
                    readable and useful book on a subject of considerable importance in the history of the Middle

                    and Personal Files.</head>
            <p>Libraries and persons who are now regular subscribers or who will become regular subscribers are
                    offered the opportunity of securing back numbers of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                    History</hi> at a low price. The earlier numbers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are too rare to
                    be included in this offer, but numerous copies of many back issues which contain useful and valuable
                    articles and documentary material that should be included in every library in Indiana and in many
                    outside the state, and which may be desired by individual subscribers are now made available at a
                    greatly reduced price.</p>
            <p>Beginning with Volume XXIII (1927), the supply of existing numbers with the exception of three
                    issues, is sufficient that these numbers will be offered to our subscribers at twenty-five cents per
                    copy or one dollar per volume. The regular price has been fifty cents per copy or two dollars per
                    volume, and this price will be maintained where the sale is to nonsubscribers. The price of earlier
                    issues will remain at a dollar and a dollar and a half per copy or four dollars and six dollars per
                    volume, depending upon the scarcity of the individual number or volume.</p>
            <p>The editor reserves the right to withdraw this special price at any time. He also reserves the right
                    to withdraw it in respect to any issue when the surplus stock of that issue is exhausted.</p>
