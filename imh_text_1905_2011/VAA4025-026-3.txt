            Amos Lane, Advocate of Western Democracy
            By WENDELL HOLMES STEPHENSON
            
            THE CALL OF THE WEST
            In the quarter-century following the War of 1812, Amos Lane was a familiar figure in southeastern
                    Indiana as he traveled the ill-kept roads and bridle-paths of the third judicial circuit, astride
                    his sixty-dollar horse, "Big Sorrel." The fashionable eel-skin queue and
                    "wilted rorum hat" identified him as an itinerant attorney. Eager for political
                    advancement, he mingled in the court yard with tillers of the soil and hewers of wood and won a seat
                    in the lower branch of the first state legislature, which elevated him to the speakership at its
                    second session. A weathervane in politics, he renounced the nationalism of Adams and Clay for the
                    more popular democracy of Andrew Jackson. Although he boasted "That he wore no collar-no
                    man's yoke," so ardently did he defend his hero in congress that he earned the
                    sobriquet of "Wheel Horse." He surpassed his idol in one respect at least; he
                    could swear mightier oaths than even the proficient Jackson. A contemporary asserted that when he
                    mounted the stump and hurled sarcasm and invective at his political opponents, he was
                    "heard to grit and grind his teeth together fifty yards."1
                    Indeed his long and loud ebullient tirades annoyed his enemies, and they dubbed him "the
                    Ajax Telamon of the Party." Like his Greek prototype, he was always ready to defend his
                    personal honor, although it is not of record that he ever served in the army.
            Amos Lane was not numbered among the great men of his generation, yet as an advocate of western
                    democracy his political career is a fascinating one. He belonged to that stream

                     of emigrants from the East which "made the central
                    west a political and social power" in the thirties. They were "poor or of moderate
                    means, to be sure, but industrious, intelligent, brave, resourceful, seeking in the new lands a free
                    political life and wider industrial opportunity."2 The influences of
                    the western wilderness accentuated their aggressiveness and boldness of spirit, and they gave
                    political expression to democratic ideals.
            Lane was born near 
                        Aurora
                    , Cayuga county, 
                        New York
                    . The meagre evidence concerning the date of his birth is conflicting. 
                        Dearborn county
                     histories record it as March 1, 1778.3 A sketch of his career which
                    appeared at the time of his death in the Lawrenceburgh Register, edited by a son,
                    George W. Lane, places the date exactly one year later.4 Amos Lane himself,
                    writing in 1831, implies that he was born in 1785.5 His "first fourteen
                    years", he informs us, "were devoted to the assistance of a Father in the
                    cultivation of a farm." He was then apprenticed to a millwright whom he served four years.
                    After trying his hand at school teaching during his nineteenth year,6 he began
                    the study of law as a clerk in the office of Joseph L. Richardson at Levanna, a few miles north of 
                        Aurora
                    . He remained in that office from September 12, 1803, until February 21, 1805, when he
                    was granted a certificate of good moral character.7 Lane then entered the law
                    office of Daniel Shepard at 
                        Aurora
                    , and there continued his study until August 7 of the same year.8
                    Shepard awarded him a certificate of character and a letter of introduction to his brother-in-law,
                    Jacob Brown, a resident of St. Lawrence county in the northern part of the state. "The
                    bearer hereof", ran the letter, "has for some time been reading in my office; and
                    is now … setting out on a tour in the county of Saint Lawrence, with a view of making a
                    permanent residence in some part of that county, in the practice of law…. Any favor you
                    may be able to render him, will be pleasing to

                        Brown
                    , but tarried until the autumn of 1806 at Ogdensburg on the St. Lawrence
                        river,10 and was there admitted to the bar.11
            
            Lane's ambition to become a lawyer was strengthened by his marriage in 1804 to a capable
                    woman, Mrs. Mary Howes, a daughter of the Revolutionary veteran, John Foote. Mrs. Lane was born in 
                        Connecticut
                     of 
                        Puritan
                     stock, and belonged to a prominent family of that state.12 It is
                    probable that she lived at Ogdensburg at the time of her marriage.13
            
            It was some time before Lane found a satisfactory location. He returned to 
                        Aurora
                     in 1806, and the following year emigrated to Steubenville in eastern 
                        Ohio
                    , and after a year's residence there, to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Indiana Territory.14 He sought admission to the 
                        Dearborn county
                     bar, but his application was rejected, he later explained, because "he was an
                    ardent friend of Thomas Jefferson." The county officials were Federalists and
                    "were not inclined to show favor to anyone who was not of their household of
                        faith".15 Older accounts state that Lane was so "incensed
                    at this rebuff" that he immediately crossed the Ohio river to the 
                        Kentucky
                     side. It is of record, however, that the 
                        Dearborn
                     court of common pleas at its April term, 1810, certified "that Amos Lane, a
                    citizen of … this territory, is of good moral character."16
                    However that may be, Lane moved to a certain Judge Piatt's farm in 
                        Boone county
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    . He soon became dissatisfied, built a large canoe and, accompanied by his wife, floated
                    his scanty household goods some fifty miles down the Ohio river to Carrollton,
                    on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side. The place did not appeal to him so he returned at once to 
                        Boone county
                     and settled at Touseytown, directly opposite 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    . Here the struggle for existence reached a crisis, and Mrs. Lane, who had had unusual
                    educational advantages in 
                        Connecticut
                    , opened a school. In 1812 the Lanes moved to 
                        Burlington
                    , the county seat of 
                        Boone
                    , where Mrs. Lane again taught school and had enrolled at one

                    the bar and soon had both civil and criminal practice. Absalom Graves, clerk of the 
                        Boone county
                     circuit court, attested that "Lane performed all his professional duties with
                    independence, ability and honest integrity, and with an unusual degree of attention, industry and
                    perseverance; and with great success."18
            
            Lane returned to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     in 1814 and had no trouble when he again sought admission to the bar. It was said that
                    the political situation had changed, but James Dill, who had earlier opposed his application for a
                    license to practice law, was in 1814 clerk of the 
                        Dearborn county
                     circuit court.
            Southeastern Indiana was a pioneer community when the Lanes emigrated to the Ohio
                    valley. 
                        Dearborn county
                    , of which 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     was the seat of justice, was organized in 1803 by Governor William Henry Harrison, and
                    named in honor of the secretary of war, General Henry Dearborn.19 It was the
                    third county to be created,20 and embraced the "Gore", as the
                    triangular area stretching from the Ohio river to Fort Recovery was called.21
                    
                        Lawrenceburg
                     was laid out in April, 1802, and was situated about twenty-three miles below 
                        Cincinnati
                    , near the mouth of the Big Miami river. When Lane arrived in 1808
                    there were a dozen log cabins, a ferry house, a log jail which also housed the jailor, a log tavern,
                    a blacksmith shop, a general store, and a chairmaker's cabin. The houses were built of
                    buckeye logs, and presented "quite a picturesque appearance during the first year of their
                    erection, [as] young shoots would put forth from every log, and give them the appearance of a mass
                    of green bushes." A brick court house was erected in 1810, and by 1813 there were two brick
                    and five frame houses. The town then boasted a blacksmith, a shoemaker, a hatter, a wheelwright, a
                    miller, an inn-keeper, a doctor, a school teacher, a jailor, a constable, and a justice of the
                        peace.22 In 1818 Nuttall described it as a thriving town,23 and the year following Timothy Flint expressed a similar opinion.24

                     About the same time Edmund Dana found there "a number
                    of large elegant houses, built with brick, a large grist and saw mill, driven by four oxen, on an
                    inclined plane wheel, a spacious cotton factory, driven by the same power, besides mechanic shops
                    and other buildings, all erected within two years." He estimated the population to be 700
                    in 1819, and concluded that no town in the state had flourished so much during the past three
                        years.25
            
            AN ITINERANT ATTORNEY
            Two years after Amos Lane returned to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Indiana was admitted into the Union. The population then lived mainly along the
                        Ohio river and up the Whitewater and Wabash
                        valleys. The new state was divided into three judicial circuits. The third embraced
                    the "Whitewater country" in the eastern part, and contained nearly one-half the
                    population of 1816.26 This district was thus described by O. H. Smith, an early
                    circuit rider: 
                        The country was new, sparsely settled, and being on the western frontier, the towns and
                            villages were filled with Indians, trading their peltries, wild game and moccasins
                            … with the settlers, for calicoes, whiskey, powder, lead, beads, and such other
                            articles as met their fancy. The population of the country embraced by the circuit, was a
                            hardy, fearless and generally honest, but more or less reckless people, such as are usually
                            to be found advancing upon the frontiers from more civilized life, and consequently there
                            were more collisions among them, more crimes committed calling for the action of the
                            criminal courts, than is common in … the older States.27
                  
                    
                
            The judicial system was likewise primitive. The circuit court consisted of a presiding judge who
                    traveled the circuit, and two associate or "side judges" elected in each county.
                    Clerks though honest possessed few qualifications. Sheriffs were elected because of "their
                    ability to run down and catch offenders", or because their voices enabled them "to
                    call the jurors and witnesses from the woods, from the door of the

                            traveler "counted two bears, three deer, and upward of 100 turkeys" in

                     court building". But the "most important
                    personages in the country … were the young lawyers, universally called
                    ‘squires’ ". They wore eel-skin queues three feet long, and mingled
                    among the people in the court yard with an air of superiority, as they electioneered for seats in
                    the next legislature.28
            
            Notwithstanding spring thaws, swollen streams, and poor roads, the life of circuit riders was in many
                    respects an en-viable one. Travel was a liberal education in itself, and their varied experiences
                    assured a cordial welcome at inns and taverns where they found "cheerful landlords and
                    good-natured landladies." Their horses were the finest available, "trained to the
                    cross-pole mud roads, and to swimming." Those used by the riders of the third circuit
                    ranged in value from forty to ninety dollars.29 Under an act of 1824 this
                    itinerary stretched from the Ohio river to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , a distance of 150 miles.30
            
            In Lane's generation "the 
                        Dearborn county
                     bar was the most ceremonious and pompous in the state",31
                    and included nearly a score of men who distinguished themselves in politics.32
                    Amos Lane "stood in the front ranks of the first generation of Indiana
                        lawyers".33 He "was tall and commanding, … his
                    gestures easy and graceful, his enunciation distinct and deliberate."34
                    Like his contemporary barristers he used "the appeal to the jury" effectively.35 His success as a lawyer is revealed by the large number of cases he had on
                    appeal before the Indiana supreme court. In the period from 1817 to 1845 he appeared on forty-six
                    cases, twenty-seven times as plaintiff's attorney and nineteen times for the defendant. In
                    twenty-eight cases he was sole counsel. Twenty-six were appealed from 
                        Dearborn county
                    , eight from 
                        Franklin
                    , three from 
                        Switzerland
                    , two from 
                  Bartholomew, Decatur
               , and Jefferson, and one from 
                  Fayette, Ripley

            One of Lane's most important cases, and the one which established his reputation as a
                    criminal lawyer, was Fuller vs.
                    
                        Warren
                    .38 It was tried in the 
                        Dearborn
                     circuit court in 1820, over which Judge Miles C. Eggleston, a young 
                        Virginia
                     lawyer, presided. Amasa Fuller and Palmer Warren both proposed marriage to a young lady
                    who accepted 
                        Warren
                    . The rejected Fuller shot his successful rival. Lane and John Test appeared for the
                    state; John Lawrence, Samuel J. Richardson, Daniel J. Caswell, Merritt S. Craig, and Charles Dewey
                    served as counsel for the accused. "The evidence was positive and conclusive,"
                    said a contemporary circuit rider, "still the arguments of counsel occupied several days.
                    Every appeal that it was possible to make to the jury by the able counsel for the prisoner, was
                    fully met by the closing speech of Mr. Lane for the State." The jury found Fuller guilty of
                    first degree murder, and the supreme court upheld the decision of the lower tribunal. The trial
                    excited wide-spread interest.39
            
            From 1815 to 1823 Lane served as prosecuting attorney of 
                        Dearborn
                     In 1826 he succeeded.40 H. Smith as prosecutor for the third
                    judicial circuit.41 Under an act approved January 30, 1824, this official was
                    appointed annually by the governor; his salary of $250 was payable quarterly by the state
                    treasury; and in addition he received a docket fee of $5.00 for every criminal case
                    successfully prosecuted. His duties were "to prosecute all pleas, plaints, indictments,

                     38 Another case with which Lane WRS connected illustrates the petty
                            origin of much litigation. A certain Isaac Jones sued Edward Harper of 
                                Connersville
                             for $2.50 damagrs, arising out of Harper's refusal to pay
                            for a quarter's worth of beef which he ciaimed had made his family sick. The
                            plaintiff was awarded twtnty-five cents by a justice's court, but thr case was

                    Ray, and began his duties August 1, 1826.44 But prosecuting attorneys under such
                    a system were too powerful and independent. Governor Ray quarreled with the legislature, and a bill
                    was passed which took the appointment out of the hands of the executive, and vested it in a joint
                    session of the general assembly.45 The bill was approved December 28, 1826, and
                    two days later the legislature balloted on district attorneys. For the third circuit, Cyrus Finch
                    received fifty-six votes, Lane thirteen, and eight were scattered. In only two of the five circuits
                    were the incumbents appointed by the governor continued by the legislature.46
            
            Lane continued to practice law, and in 1827 he occupied an office in 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     "next door to Mr. Hunt's Hotel". He notified "the
                    public that he will constantly attend the Terms of the Supreme Court; the District
                    Court of the 
                        United States
                    , at 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; the 
                  Franklin, Dearborn, Switzerland
                and 
                        Ripley
                     Circuit Courts; and any other Court in the State, on special application. That in the
                        future his undivided and persevering
                    attention and talents will be devoted to his profession."47 A few years later the partnership of "Major & Lane"
                    was formed, with an office on High street. The firm announced that it would practice "in
                    the Superior and Inferior Courts of Indiana, & in the counties of Boon, Ky., and
                            
                  Hamilton, Ohio
               ."48
            
            POLITICAL BEGINNINGS
            Soon after Lane settled down at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     following his migratory years in 
                        Kentucky
                    , he entered politics. He was elected to the first state legislature which convened at
                    Corydon on November 4, 1816.49 That he took an active part in

                     debate is revealed by a perusal of the House
                        Journal during the sessions that he was a member. It is a conservative estimate to say that
                    he introduced more bills than any other member. Procedure in the early sessions was expedited by
                    means of special committees, and Lane's name appeared on almost every one appointed. On
                    November 9 the speaker, Isaac Blackford, named five such committees and Lane was chairman of four of
                    them. These were to consider those portions of the governor's message which recommended a
                    revision of the statutes of a general nature; the prevention of illegal removal of free negroes from
                    the state; provision "for the more regular discharge of the duties of the justices of the
                    peace;" and "the punishment of crimes in proportion to the enormity of the
                        offense."50 Throughout the first session Lane was tireless in
                    providing legislation for inaugurating forms and functions of a new state government.
            Again in 1817 he was chosen to represent 
                        Dearborn county
                     in the general assembly. His record of the previous year won for him the speakership of
                    the house,51 and he discharged his duties with the ability of a veteran. He
                    served a third term, 1821-1822,52 and during that session he was chairman of the
                    committee for enrolled bills and a member of the committee on the judiciary.53
                    In addition he served on numerous select committees, presided frequently when the house was in
                    committee of the whole,54 and was one of five managers to prosecute the
                    impeachment of the clerk of Vigo county, Curtis Gilbert.55
            
            In the 'twenties there began a new era in internal improvements. Although states were
                    anxious to obtain federal aid, "they preferred to build their own roads and dig their own
                        canals."56 De Witt Clinton of 
                        New York
                    , the "Dean of Internal Improvements," visited the Ohio
                        river states in 1825 in the interest of canal construction.57 He
                    attended the 
                        Ohio
                     Canal celebration near 
                        Newark

                        Louisville
                    
                    via the Ohio river, he stopped at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     July 18, and Lane made an eloquent and adulatory address of welcome.59 In unselfish devotion to his country 
                        Clinton
                     was to be compared with 
                        Washington
                    . He concluded: 
                        Governor—we cannot receive you with splendor, nor entertain you at the luxuriant
                            board. But permit me to assure you of that which will be infinitely more gratifying
                            … that in our admiration you stand high; in our confidence firm; in our gratitude
                            and affections full.60
                  
                    
                
            In the gubernatorial campaign of 1825, Lane, supported James B. Ray who ran on an internal
                    improvement platform.61 Although Lane had formerly been a close friend of Judge
                    Isaac Blackford, and had probably urged him to stand for election, a bitter quarrel now arose.
                    Shortly before the election, "Indianian" wrote an article for the 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    
                    Palladium, attempting "to prove 
                        Blackford
                     all that was amiable and great-Col. Ray all that was contemptible and
                    degraded". Lane replied in two articles over the signature of "An
                    Elector" in the Indiana Spectator. His purpose, he declared, was to
                    provide the electors of the state, "in a plain, simple, unvarnished manner, without design,
                    prejudice, or partiality, … just such information as they wanted—a
                    biographical and political history of the two rival candidates for the first office of the
                        state."62
                    
                        Blackford
                     realized the significance of Lane's opposition and visited 
                        Dearborn county
                     a few days before the election. In a hand-bill which was presented to voters on
                    election day, he characterized Lane as "a cowardly scoundrel, and a base fabricator of
                    falsehood." He deemed it his duty to reveal the authorship of the "slanderous
                    publications…. They were written by AMOS LANE, whose infamous character is too notorius
                    to require, or even excuse, any comments from me, respecting anything he can write."
                    Appended to the "Card" were sundry statements, one by John
                    Spencer, an editor of the Spectator, naming Lane as the author of the articles
                    signed "An Elector", and another by George H. Dunn, certifying "that at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , during the last term of the

                     Supreme Court, I heard Amos Lane urge Mr. Blackford to become a
                    candidate for Governor at the ensuing election, at the same time assuring him that he would get most
                    of the votes of this county."63
            
            Lane countered with a broadside of his own on election day. 
                        Blackford
                    's hand-bill had appeared in the Palladium, and the next
                    issue carried Lane's circular, together with an explanatory statement. These two incendiary
                    and provocative documents from Lane's pen are important in that they reveal his use of
                    sarcasm and invective and his appeal to the masses for support. 
                        Blackford
                    , he said, was a "diminutive, weezle-faced sparrow,"
                    who preferred to lose fifty elections rather "than call Amos Lane to the field
                        of honor, in order to test his firmness or his courage." He asked the public to
                    review the newspaper controversy from the beginning, "and then determine where …
                    lives the villain, the liar, the coward, the poltroon, in 
                        Vincennes
                     or Lawrenceburgh.—I pronounce, to the world, his name, Isaac Blackford, of 
                        Vincennes
                    ." Lane then recited the facts in the case: 
                        On Saturday morning preceding the election, 
                                Blackford
                             arrives in Lawrenceburgh. He had promised himself an undivided vote in 
                                Dearborn
                            —His prospects had failed him—He inquired the
                            cause—His desponding friends pointed him to ‘Elector,’ and
                            to Amos Lane, as the cloud, which had obscured his political horizon. A sudden paleness came
                            over him—Folly, madness, and desperation seized him-He ran to the
                            printer—demanded the name of him, who had thus dared to inform the Plebeian
                            ranks, the people, who Isaac Blackford was. The editors disagreed. He then met me in the
                            road, with an advance and rear guard; and with all the insolence of a Turkish
                                Lord, demanded if I was the author? To which I substantially replied, that I would
                            say nothing to him in the highway; but that if he would call on me in a proper manner, time,
                            and place, I would give him such information as to which I might consider him entitled. The
                            Judge then, between hope and despair, begot his hand-bill, a most
                            unfortunate child, and still more unfortunate father; … and the little
                            illigitimate brat barely survives, as evidence of its father's folly and
                            wickedness.
                    
                
            Thus did 
                        Blackford
                    , the "princely slanderer", resort to calumny and
                    defamation for revenge. Lane's own career stood in sharp contrast with that of the
                    "proud, overbearing aristocrat." For, said he, "I keep no servants; but
                    labor with my own hands, in the performance of my domestic concerns." 
                  
                     63
                            Ibid., Aug. 5. 1825.
               
                     Professionally, he "made it a rule … to do
                    the business of the poor man, the widow, and orphan, without fee or reward". He replied to 
                        Blackford
                    's hand-bill because it "was an insolent reflection, and high insult
                    to my fellow citizens of 
                        Dearborn county
                    , who have so repeatedly honored me with their confidence".64
            
            In the national contest of 1824, Lane thought only Adams and Clay qualified for the presidency.
                    "I considered Mr. Adams the more solid, Mr. Clay the more visionary man. I therefore
                    espoused the cause of Mr. Adams with great zeal and voted for him."65
                    The secretary of war in Adams' cabinet, James Barbour of 
                        Virginia
                    , soon honored Lane with an invitation "to attend the examination of the cadets
                    at West Point."66 Included on the board of visitors were General Sam
                    Houston of 
                        Tennessee
                     and Governor Jeremiah Morrow of 
                        Ohio
                    , the latter of whom had accompanied DeWitt Clinton to Lawrenceburg the year before.
            As the election of 1828 approached, it appeared that Lane intended to support Adams. On November 27,
                    1827, he presided at a political meeting held in the cabin of the steamer Velocepede forty miles below 
                        Louisville
                    . Resolutions were adopted approving the measures of Adams' administration,
                    pledging those present to use ail honorable and fair means to secure his reëlection,
                    asserting that other qualifications than "military talents and fame" were
                    necessary for office, denying that Jackson possessed "sufficient diplomatic information and
                    experience" to exercise executive power, and declaring "That we do not believe
                    that John Q. Adams was elected President of the 
                        United States
                     by any intrigue, bargin, sale, or unfair means whatever."67
            
            In 1831, after Lane had become a loyal Jackson Democrat and a candidate for congress, he experienced
                    some difficulty in explaining his former support of Adams. The result of the house contest of 1825,
                    he said, astonished him. It bore "the appearance, if not, of bargain, of concert,"
                    and 
                        Clay
                    's "ready acceptance … of the secretaryship" he
                    "considered even more objectionable." He further asserted:

                        From this moment, but for the pride of opinion, I should have abandoned both Adams and Clay;
                            and but for the doubts entertained of the qualifications of Gen. Jackson for civil rule,
                            become his friend and advocate. I continued however apparently to sustain the former and
                            condemn the latter. My acquaintance with certain individuals in 1826, removed much of my
                            former prejudice against Gen. Jackson. In the latter part of the year 1827 I became fully
                            persuaded, that all my former opinions, my prejudices had been founded upon
                            misrepresentations. In the spring of 1828, I visited 
                                St. Louis
                             and saw and became acquainted with gentlemen upon whose judgment I could rely,
                            and whose integrity I could not suspect. They removed all my doubts; since which I have been
                            satisfied, that Andrew Jackson's qualifications for the presidency, were as
                            eminent, as his military career had been successful and brilliant.
                        From the moment I became the advocate of Andrew Jackson and sustained his pretensions and
                            claims for the presidency with an untiring zeal, and voted for him at the polls.68
                  
                    
                
            This labored explanation is a politician's justification of his course, and therefore must
                    be discounted. Sources have been searched in vain for evidence of Lane's political
                    activities in 1828. A month after he presided at the administration meeting on the Velocepede, Adams men of 
                        Dearborn county
                     assembled at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     and issued an address, but there is no record that Lane participated.69 Nor did he attend any of the numerous Adams or Jackson conventions held at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It is probable that he purposely remained inactive that he might profit by the
                    outcome. Jackson carried Indiana by 5,000 votes, with six out of ten counties in Lane's
                    congressional district, including 
                        Dearborn
                    .70 Undoubtedly it was at this time that he first openly declared
                    himself "the advocate of Andrew Jackson", and supported him with that
                    "untiring zeal" that he later emphasized.
            Contemplating politics in a wider field, Lane took advantage of every opportunity to inform the
                    public of his merits. To those who attempted to slander his character he replied in kind and usually
                    got the better of the argument. In September, 1830, he wrote an "Appeal to the People of
                    the State of Indiana", an answer to those politicians who had conspired for sixteen years
                    "to misrepresent, slander, and persecute

                    certificates of "good moral character" from various periods of his career.71 In another article he berated the senior editor of the Western
                        Statesman,
                    
                        Milton
                     Gregg, whom he characterized as "an outlaw to all principles of humanity,
                    charity, benevolence, truth, and decency—a fit companion for the demon and the
                        damned."72
            
            On December 18, 1830, Democratic members of the legislature and other friends of the administration
                    met in caucus at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Lane was placed on the resolutions committee, and was also appointed a member of a
                    standing committee of twenty.73 A few weeks later he announced his candidacy for
                        congress.74 In March, 1831, he again reviewed his early career for the
                    press, and emphasized the circumstances of his change from Adams to Jackson. In this communication
                    he stated his policies. He favored a protective tariff, liberal appropriations to complete the 
                        Cumberland
                     road, additional appropriations of land for the 
                        Wabash
                     canal, the construction of a road from 
                        Fort Wayne
                     to the mouth of the Kentucky river
                    via
                    
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , removal of Indians from the state, graduation of the price of public lands, free
                    homesteads for actual settlers, rotation in office, economy in the use of public money, and a rigid
                    accountability of a representative to his constituents.75 On March 30 he
                    addressed a political meeting in the 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     court house. He defended the policies of the administration, especially rotation in
                    office and the Maysville road veto, but he insisted that Jackson was in favor of systematic internal
                        improvements.76
            
            An embarrassing situation soon arose in the fourth congressional district. Jonathan McCarty, also a
                    Jackson man, was a candidate, and Lane withdrew in the interest of party harmony.77 A state Jackson meeting at 
                        Indianapolis
                     promised him support for lieutenant governor, but two months later he withdrew from
                    that contest. Private business called him from the state, it was explained, which prevented him from
                    making a canvass. Further, Ross Smiley desired the office,

                     and Lane had consented to run "with the expectation
                    that there would be no opposing candidate from our own ranks."78
            
            In 1833 Lane entered the congressional contest in earnest, declaring that he would continue a
                    candidate regardless of opposition.79 He canvassed the district thoroughly,
                    making at least twenty speeches.80 Lane complained that his opponent, John Test,
                    would not meet him in joint debate, and Test accused Lane of "expressing different opinions
                    in different parts of the district." Lane therefore addressed a communication to the voters
                    in which he set forth his views. He favored reduction of the price of refuse lands to fifty cents an
                    acre, 
                        Clay
                    's compromise tariff bill, a uniform national currency, and recharter of the 
                        United States
                     Bank with restrictions.81 In the election he carried five of the
                    six counties in the fourth congressional district, and received 4,262 votes to 3,455 for Test.82
            
            A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, 1833-1837
            According to the most reliable reckoning, Lane was fifty-five when in December, 1833, he entered the
                    twenty-third congress. His residence at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     "was so situated that he could travel [to 
                        Washington
                    ] either by water or by stage from his own door."83 As he
                    was nearing the capital for a subsequent session, the coach upset near 
                  Hancock, Maryland
               , and he was forced to tarry there two or three days because of a
                    severe injury to his head.84
            
            Arriving in 
                        Washington
                     for his first session, Lane immediately subscribed for several "daily papers
                    and Congressional Journals" at his own expense. His purpose, he said, was to disseminate
                    "correct political information" and to keep his constituents "constantly
                    advised of his own views and acts." He therefore provided "each Editor in the
                    district and several citizens of each township …. with the earliest possible political
                    and Congressional information…. In the performance of this duty," he explained.

            Lane was a veteran in politics when he began his quadrennium in congress, and at once entered
                    actively into the business of the house. A month after he took his seat the Palladium praised his initial efforts: "Mr. L. has proved that he can speak, and to
                    the point, when necessary, as well on the floor of Congress as elsewhere—though his
                    course has thus far been prudently circumspect…. In him, the people of this district have
                    a representative capable of maintaining their rights in a dignified and commanding
                        manner."86 His speeches were colored by two considerations. On
                    numerous occasions he went out of his way to extol and defend the virtues of the "venerable
                    Chief Magistrate."87 He applied opprobrious epithets to those of the
                    opposition who, regardless of "the subject or the occasion," took "a dash
                    at the Executive or his friends."88 He was just as faithful in his
                    advocacy of measures peculiarly western. As the sessions drew to a close and the house began to
                    discuss adjournment, Lane would plead that "not a bill in which the West was interested had
                    yet been acted upon."89
            
            His aggressiveness elicited the attention of a visitor from 
                        Tennessee
                    , who wrote to a friend in 
                  Columbus,
                            Mississippi
               , December 21, 1836: 
                        Mr. Lane of Indiana, a man by the way that Mr. Wise dreads more than any other in the House
                            for his pungent satire and caustic humor—made a capital speech to-day. He cut
                            Peyton into mince meat, and hashed up 
                                Wise
                             and Bell in capital style. Mr. Lane is by no means equal to either gentleman in
                            point of talents; but he has a plain-dealing, mater-of-fact manner about him; a nack of
                            calling things by their right names; a method of cutting up and giving side-swipes, and
                            fifth-rib thrusts, peculiar to himself, and it is astonishing how he annoys these three
                            distinguished gentlemen. 
                                Wise
                             knows he can gain nothing by picking a quarrel with the member from Indiana,
                            for he is known to be a man "familiar with fight" in all its shapes, from
                            the

                            and is the most thorough and regular bred tongue lasher in Congress. You
                            will see Lane's speech reported—It was a … hit, and it is a
                            remarkable fact that while Webster was speaking in the Senate to-day on the treasury order,
                            Lane kept a crowded audience in the House and

                            as Peyton and Wise. As for Bell, he winced for half an hour and made a precipitate
                                retreat.90
                  
                    
                
            John Quincy Adams recorded in his diary, however, "That there had not been a quorum in the
                    House one-third of the time while Lane was speaking." The member from Indiana, he said,
                    "was charged with a speech of an hour" on 
                        Wise
                    's resolution of enquiry into the executive departments, "which he
                    accordingly delivered—a full glorification of Martin Van Buren."91 But Lane was willing to cross swords with Adams. About a year before he recalled
                    "A day when by management, and by means of which it becomes us not to
                    speak, eighty-four was made to prevail over ninety-nine."92
            
            On at least one occasion Lane was very unfortunate in the outcome of a personal altercation. Two of
                    his colleagues from Indiana, Jonathan McCarty and John Ewing, supported an investigation of alleged
                    frauds committed by Indian agents. Lane desired to correct the impression that any such frauds had
                    been committed in Indiana. He had known the agents there for twenty years and declared that they
                    were "incapable of committing a fraud." As was his habit he seized the opportunity
                    to eulogize his constituents and those of his colleagues. "Sir," he said,
                    "a purer, more intelligent, high-minded, and honorable population than that of Indiana,
                    cannot be found in any other State."93
            
            It soon appeared that Lane had accused his colleagues of locating the frauds in Indiana, but later
                    wrote a speech for publication in the Globe in which the tone of his remarks was
                    softened. The gratutious eulogy which Lane had pronounced, said Ewing, was "uncalled
                    for," as the reputation of the people of Indiana had not been questioned. Lane then
                    reproached Ewing for claiming "the exclusive privilege of eulogizing and defending his own
                    constituents." Further, when he desired "to impugn the motives" of his
                    colleagues, "he would do it elsewhere than in that House; he would do it as a gentleman,
                    and not in a manner to protect himself with the splendid walls

                    would "be at the peril—," but the speaker called him to order and he
                    did not complete the sentence.94
            
            A few days later McCarty replied at length. Regardless of repeated disclaimers that he had not made
                    charges against any particular district, he said, Lane continued his false accusations. It was his
                    duty to "expose this mis-representation, which was intended to operate more elsewhere than here." Even in 
                        Dearborn county
                     acts had transpired "not altogether consistent with honesty and
                        fair-dealing." Nor was his resolution introduced "for the purpose of
                    ferreting out and making charges against the administration." He was, in fact, "an
                    older soldier in the support of the administration than" Lane. He likened that gentleman to
                    "a species of animals in our forests, with whom, notwithstanding their weakness and abject
                    meanness of spirit, the lion himself would shun a controversy."95
            
            Ewing added his chastisement of Lane's conduct. He informed him that "The people
                    require services, not flattery;" that the house was "no place to play the
                    braggart," that the "peril" to which he alluded was
                    "fudge," that he did not seek the "protection from the walls, dome, or
                    drapery," that he held himself "personally responsible" for his remarks
                    there or elsewhere, and Lane "may pursue what course he chooses." He would admit,
                    however, that his colleague manifested "art" in his attempts "to injure
                    faithful Representatives at home."96
            
            The controversy had taken a turn unforseen by Lane. Realizing that he was getting the worst of it, he
                    attempted to divert attention of members to the fact that they were "in the house of
                    mourning" for the loss of one of their number. Recoiling into his shell of
                    "saint-like sanctity," he placed himself above the petty controversies of this
                    world: "Sir, there is a manner, a language, a courtesy, a delicacy, and sweetness of
                    expression, in the heat of even angry debate, that characterises the gentleman and the
                    scholar—a language, a look, that distinguishes him from the vulgar ruffian. To look at
                    such a man is to know him a gentleman, elevated in mind, pure in thought, sensitive in feeling,
                    alive to his honor, always respecting

                     the feelings and regarding the honor of others." On
                    the other hand, there was the man whose "ruling passions" and "weapons of
                    warfare" were "envy, revenge, detraction, calumny." He did not apply the
                    pattern to his colleagues, but if contrary to his "wishes and intentions, a claim should be
                    asserted, I assure the House … that nothing shall be charged for the cutting or the
                        making."97 One thing he would say in his own defence, he had
                    continually been at his post, "not a day or an hour absent," a "faithful
                    sentinel over the rights and the honor" of his state and district. McCarty, he said, had
                    been absent at roll-call eighty-two times and Ewing forty-seven. On these "occasions, what
                    would have been the condition of their constituents, had their honor or their interests required an
                        advocate?"98 But the point was seized by McCarty and Ewing, and
                    they renewed the attack. It was known that Lane had been "filching" extracts from
                    the clerk's records regarding their absences, which he had published in their districts.
                    But that he had "voluntarily given testimony to his own depravity" was
                        unbelievable.99
            
            Lane made no reply. Three weeks later his eldest son, John Foote Lane, a West Point graduate,
                    assaulted Ewing with a heavy cane as the latter was returning to his boarding house from the
                    capitol, and he was unable to resume his seat for several days.100

                                John F. Lane, a Lieuttnant in the army and son of the Hon. A. Lane, of Indiana, for no
                                other known cause than for words spoken in debate some weeks aince, in reply to his

                            For the proceedings of the "Court of Inquiry on Lieutenant Lane." see
                                    Niles' Waekly Register, XLVIII, 80. Major General
                                Winfield Scott, president of the court, did not recommend that the case be sent to a
                                general court martial, but expressed the hope "that nothing similar will ever
                                again occur for legal investigation, or public censure." President Jackson
                                advised the secretary of war, after reading the report, that John Lane's action
                                "was highly improper, and deserves reproof: but as neither the committee of the
                                house of representatives nor the court of inquiry … have thought the conduct
                                of lieut. Lane deserving further invcstigation, the secrrtary of war will cause the
                                result to he made known … as a public reprimand to lieut. Lane, and direct
                                him to be relievtrl from his present duty and rcport to his reziment." Lanr was
                                then serving as assistant quarter master. He soon rose to be lieutenant colonel, and was
                                killed while lcading a regiment in the 
                                    Florida
                                 war of 1836.
                        
               
                     on post offices and post roads.101 He
                    presented numerous petitions for new mail routes in his own district and those adjacent in Indiana, 
                        Kentucky
                    , and 
                        Ohio
                    .102 and secured the establishment of a number of them.103 He was placed on the committee on the 
                        District of Columbia
                     during his second term,104 and was instrumental in investigating
                    imprisonment for debt in the national capital.105 In this capacity he had
                    opportunity to acquire first-hand information relative to the slave trade.
            Toward slavery and slavery agitation Lane assumed a conservative attitude. In 1835 he voted to table
                    petitions praying for abolition in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    , and opposed printing such papers.106 In March of the following
                    year 
                        Wise
                     presented a memorial from a resident of the District, "protesting against the
                    course of the northern abolitionists, … and insisting that all abolition petitions should
                    be forthwith rejected." He moved to refer it to the select committee on abolition with
                    instructions to report a resolution "That Congress has no constitutional power to abolish
                    slavery in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    , or in the Territories of the 
                        United States
                    ." The speaker decided that the motion to instruct was not in order, and 
                        Wise
                     appealed from the chair's decision. Lane grew impatient at what he considered
                    a waste of time. Six weeks, he said, had been consumed "in the presentation and
                    consideration of memorials and resolutions on the subject of abolition from the North, to the entire
                    exclusion of all petitions and memorials from the western States and Territories. Having, after this
                    protracted period, passed 
                        Mason
                     and Dixon's line, it was fondly hoped no further delay would have occurred
                    from this all exciting subject. In this it seems we are mistaken. The fire brands of abolition seem
                    to thicken around us from the south, and threaten equal if not more delay. To avert this storm, and
                    to enable the people of the west to be heard in this House, he would move the
                    previous question." The house voted to sustain the decision of the chair, and the memorial
                    was referred without instructions.107

            On May 25 and 26 an exciting debate occurred on resolutions presented by Henry L. Pinckney of 
                        South Carolina
                    , from the select committee on abolition. Especially was the controversy warm between
                    Speaker Polk and John Quincy Adams. The latter observed "that a slaveholding Speaker
                    occupied the Chair," and was at once called to order by several members. The previous
                    question cut off debate, and Adams after taking various appeals from the chair's decisions,
                    exclaimed, "Mr. Speaker, am I gagged or not?"108 The house
                    adopted the first resolution on the 25th and the second and third on the 26th. The resolution
                    "That Congress possesses no constitutional authority to interfere in any way with the
                    institution of slavery in any of the States of this Confederacy," passed, 182 to 9, Lane
                    voting in the affirmative.109 The second, "That Congress ought not to
                    interfere in any way with slavery in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    ," was adopted by a vote of 132 to 45, Lane voting in the negative. The
                    "gag" resolution, to table all slavery petitions and memorials without debate,
                    printing, or reference, passed, 117 to 68, Lane voting in the negative.110
            
            The following year, 1837, another great debate grew out of the presentation of abolition petitions,
                    and occupied the attention of the house for four days, February 6, 7, 9, and 11. After having
                    presented a number of such petitions, Adams inquired of the speaker if a paper which "came
                    from twenty persons declaring themselves to be slaves" would come "under the
                    rule." The chair said the case was novel, and requested the "advice and
                    counsel" of the house. Southern representatives were much alarmed. Charles E. Haynes of 
                        Georgia
                     "moved that the petition be not received," but immediately withdrew
                    the motion. Dixon H. Lewis of 
                        Alabama
                     "thought that the Representatives of the slaveholding States should demand that the attempt to introduce such a petition should
                    instantly put in requisition the power of the House to punish the member for such attempt. If this
                    is not done, and that promptly, every member from the slave States should immediately, in a body, quit this House, and go home to their constituents. We have no longer any
                    business here." The proposal of Julius C. Alford of 
                        Georgia
                     that the memorial "be instantly burnt" should Adams insist on
                    presenting it, was met 
                  
                     108
                            Ibid., 401.

                     110
                            Ibid., 406.
               
                     with "Cries of ‘No!’
                    ‘No!’ ‘Expel him!’ ‘Expel the
                    mover!’ " Waddy Thompson of 
                        South Carolina
                     moved that Adams "instantly be brought to the bar, to receive the severe
                    censure of the Speaker." Lewis proposed a substitute, accepted by Thompson, that
                    Adams' "attempt to introduce into this House a petition, of
                    slaves for the abolition of slavery in the 
                        District of Columbia
                    " was "an outrage on the rights and feelings" of the Southern
                    people, and "a flagrant contempt on the dignity of this House," and he should
                    therefore be censured at the bar.111
            
            It soon developed that the memorial prayed that abolitionists desist from presenting their petitions.
                    The resolutions were then modified by declaring that Adams had "trifled with the
                    House" in creating a wrong impression.112 On the last day of the debate
                    Lane obtained the floor.
            "That Congress have no power to interfere with slavery, as it exists in the
                    States," he said, "is a proposition too clear to admit of a doubt. The wildest
                    fanatic does not claim this power on the part of Congress.
            "That Congress does possess that power over the subject, in the 
                        District of Columbia
                     … was equally true." The exercise of that power, however,
                    "would be injurious to that species of property, in the hands of the owners in the
                    neighborhood of the District, and fearfully dangerous to the tranquillity of the Union." He
                    then explained what abolitionists desired: 
                        They set forth that, in their opinion, slavery, in the abstract, is a great moral, political,
                            and religious evil, and pray its abolishment in the 
                                District of Columbia
                            , together with the slave trade—a traffic carried on within the
                            District as inhuman as it is disgraceful to the American people. That as a member of the
                            Committee for the 
                                District of Columbia
                            , he had examined the jail—the common property of the people of every
                            portion of this Union; and to his surprise he found that prison the common receptacle for
                            the safekeeping of slaves brought up in the neighboring States by the dealers in human
                            flesh, and there detained until the master or an agent shall find it convenient to drive
                            them to a southern market; and all this without regard to comfort or convenience. In one
                            instance he found in a damp, loathsome room of eight feet square, a mother and six or seven
                            children; nor is this all, within this District are private prisons, into which they are
                            driven in droves, and kept for weeks and months, and then shipped to the south. This, all
                            this cruelty, this loathsome suffering, this inhuman traffic, is carried on in open day

                           112
                                    Ibid., 165.
                     
                             in [the] presence of the American people, at the seat
                            of liberty and boasted freedom. It is this cruel, this disgraceful trade, those petitioners
                            humbly and respectfully pray you to abolish. To this end … he would receive these
                            petitions, refer them, and act upon them promptly and effectively.
                    
                
            As to the resolution then before the house, presented by Pickens of 
                        South Carolina
                    , "That any member who shall hereafter present any petition from the slaves of
                    this Union, ought to be considered as regardless of the feelings of the House, the rights of the
                    southern States, and unfriendly to the Union," Lane thought it too equivocal. It might be
                    inferred that members had "been in the habit of presenting such petitions; …
                    that it had been lawful to do so; … [that] the slave not only possessed such right, but
                    had exercised it." Were it adopted 
                        you would have seen the disappointed and ambitious politicians of the south …
                            fanning the flame of discontent; yes, upon every stump, at every muster, in every hall,
                            sounding the alarm, danger, danger, disunion. The resolution would have been tortured into
                            any and every possible meaning, to prove any and everything. It would have been rightly
                            denounced at the South as loosening, instead of drawing, the cord upon the slave.
                        The South would have been in a political flame; in the North the politicians would have blown
                            the tide of abolition to its height, and all brought to bear upon the Administration.
                    Lane therefore favored an explicit declaration—"that the slaves of this
                    Union have no right to petition Congress for the abolition of slavery."113 Such a resolution was adopted by a vote of 162 to 18, and the house refused to receive the
                    petition presented by Adams, 160 to 35.114 In the meantime Adams had explained
                    that "he now believed the petition to be a "forgery," designed as a
                    ‘hoax’ upon him."115 It is highly probable that
                    his presentation of it was designed as a hoax upon Southern, members that they might commit
                    themselves to principles and policies which would serve as abolition thunder in the North.
            Throughout his services in congress, Lane introduced pension petitions from soldiers in his own and
                    adjacent constituencies.116

                     Early in the twenty-third congress Thomas Chilton proposed to
                    amend the general pension law of 1832 by extending it to include veterans of Indian wars between the
                    Revolution and the treaty of Greenville. Lane declared "that a body of more meritorious men
                    than these had never been provided for by Congress."117 On January 23,
                    1834, he made a long speech on the subject, which he concluded the following day. He refuted the
                    arguments of those who insisted that the principle underlying pensions was "immoral, corrupt, and corrupting," that it substituted
                    "indolence for industry and enterprise," and that additional pensions would
                    constitute "a burden to society." The bill should pass without objection or
                    amendment, he said, "from respect to the wishes of the western people, … if not
                    as a matter of courtesy to the western delegation." These "frontier men of the
                    West," who fought at greater disadvantages than many already pensioned, had acquired vast
                    territory for the 
                        United States
                     now populated by migrants from the older states.118 Parenthetically
                    he defended the career of General Arthur St. Clair, against whom, he said, great injustice had been
                        done.119
            
            In the disposition of the public lands Lane favored preemption120 and restriction
                    of sales to actual settlers,121 principles of vital importance "to the
                    interest of the people of the western country."122 The
                    preëmption bill of 1834 received his support and passed the house, 124 to 53.123 In December, 1836, he urged congress to prevent fradulent practices which
                    obtained at auction sales. He explained that 
                        there were thousands of individuals, who traversed the wilderness in search of land, with
                            their one hundred dollars to pay for eighty acres, … Well, sir, after they have
                            made their selections, and come to the sales, prepared to pay for their lands, there are
                            some ten, fifteen, or twenty agents of speculators, who have never put themselves to the
                            expense and inconvenience of searching after lands, with their hundreds of thousands of
                            dollars, and when the poor man bids his one hundred dollars for eighty acres, the
                            speculators bid five or ten more, and take

                             the land. Thus, perhaps, the Government gets a few
                            dollars more, but it is at the expense of the poor man, who is afterward compelled to pay a
                            higher price to the speculators. Thus are the speculators enriched, and the poor men, who
                            intend to become actual settlers, either forced to pay them an extravagant price, or take
                            second or third-rate land.124
                  
                    
                
            Lane was a strong advocate of the graduation bill. It was one, he said, "in which the
                    western people had more at stake, and felt a more lively interest in than any other".125 The first resolution he introduced in congress was one suggesting reduction
                    in price to actual settlers, of lands which had been on the market for fifteen years, with
                    preëmption rights for squatters.126 A year later, December, 1834, he
                    introduced a similar resolution which would permit cultivators to enter a quarter-section of land
                    remaining unsold after twenty years, at fifty cents an acre.127 Such a measure,
                    he said, "will give homes, and ease, and independence, to thousands of our honest and
                    intelligent, but less fortunate fellow-citizens."128 For the benefit of
                    the forty and eighty-acre men, he "would reduce the price to even nothing."129
            
            It would seem that registers and receivers of the public land offices were unpopular with Lane. On
                    two occasions he successfully opposed further compensation for them. On December 22, 1834, a bill
                    was introduced authorizing them to administer oaths in the entry or purchase of public lands, and
                    receive compensation therefor at the legal rate. Lane offered an amendment making it their duty to
                    administer such oaths without remuneration. He explained that their income was already so great that
                    the positions "were eagerly sought after". Although the salary was only
                    $500, they received in addition one per cent on sales and a commission on deposits,
                    making the total in many cases from $1,500 to $3,000 a year. If they were
                    further compensated for administering oaths, some would receive as much as $5,000.130 Again on April, 15, 1836, he successfully opposed an amendment to pay land
                    officers office rent not to exceed $300.131

            Lane opposed the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of western lands. Henry Clay, who
                    advocated the policy, persistently brought forward such bills only to see them fail in the lower
                    house or receive the executive's veto. A bill passed the senate in May, 1835, but was
                    tabled in the house.132 Lane argued that it might "dry up all the
                    streams of emigration to the west, and check her growing prosperity." Further, it would
                    "convert the General Government to tax-gatherers, and the West and South to
                    tax-payers." He saw in the measure only the desire of a political party to win me
                    presidency in 1836.133
            
            At the next session of congress, Chilton Allan of 
                        Kentucky
                     introduced a distribution resolution in the house. He proposed that public lands be
                    given to seventeen states—the thirteen original, and in addition, 
                  Maine, Vermont, Kentucky
               , and 
                        Tennessee
                    —in proportion as congress had already donated lands to the other states for
                    purposes of education and internal improvements. The land grants were to be sold under the existing
                    federal laws, the proceeds to be turned over to the enumerated states. The proposition, Lane said,
                    was unfair for two reasons. In the first place the newer states had received their lands when their
                    population was only a third of what it was at present. Thus 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     would receive more than Indiana and 
                        Ohio
                     had been granted, although they had less population. In the second place, some of the
                    new states had received their land on condition that they would not tax government lands for five
                    years after their sale, and that the government should retain all minerals and salt springs. The new
                    states had received their shares 
                        when the lands were an unbroken wilderness; when there were no roads, no mills, no
                            meeting-houses, no school-houses; and were only inhabited by wild beasts, and the roving
                            savages. But now, when all the comforts of life were to be found in the vicinity of those
                            lands, the old States were to come in for a portion of them, equal to those granted to the
                            new States. Who raised the value of those lands? Those who remained at home in ease,
                            comfort, and luxury; or those hardy pioneers who went into the wilderness, subdued the
                            savage, and made it smile and blossom as the rose? The old States, by this resolution, were
                            to come in for a share of these lands when they were not only easy of access, but when 
                        
                           132
                                    Ibid., 460. Curiously, Lane voted against laying it on the table.

                             their value was raised by the enterprise and industry
                            of the citizens of the new States.134
                  
                    
                
            It will be recalled that from 1825 forward Lane favored internal improvements at the expense of the
                    federal govemment. As a member of congress he was active in securing appropriations to continue the 
                        Cumberland
                     road westward,135 but a scheme to build a lateral southward through
                            
                  Ohio, Kentucky,
                            Tennessee
               , and 
                        Alabama
                     to 
                        New Orleans
                    , which he favored, failed.136 He also sought aid for constructing a
                    Whitewater canal from the National road to 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    ,137 and an appropriation of refuse lands to promote the building of
                    a railroad from 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     to Indianapoli.138 The appropriation bill of 1835 provided
                    $50,000 to improve the Ohio river between the Falls and Pittsburg.
                    Lane favored it, for the 
                        Ohio
                     of all rivers was "the most truly national" in the country. He said
                    "he would not give a fig for the constitution if the Treasury of the nation could not be
                    expended in promoting such works as the present."139 He also supported
                    a measure to increase the corps of topographical engineers, greatly in demand for making surveys for
                    internal improvements. William C. Dunlap of 
                        Tennessee
                     chided Lane, who had been elected as a friend of the president, for sponsoring measures
                    opposed by the administration. Lane replied that he had "received a lesson in party
                    discipline" which Dunlap should have applied to himself. He admitted that "he had
                    been elected as a friend of the distinguished Chief Magistrate, not to serve the Chief Magistrate,
                    but to serve his constituents, the State, and the Union." He assured the house
                    "That he wore no collar-no man's yoke." His course had been directed by
                    "the dictates of his own conscience and judgment," influenced only by
                    "the interest and prosperity of his constituents, the State, and the Union." He
                    would compare votes with Dunlap and prove himself the more efficient and loyal supporter of the
                    administration. The present measure, required by the secretary of war and recommended by the
                    president in his message, "is emphatically an administration measure." The

                    commerce" if they were "in the character of national works." He
                    concluded: 
                        If the gentleman means to be understood that to be a Jackson man is to oppose all
                            appropriations for the improvements of our rivers and channels of commerce, and all aid by
                            the General Government for improvements in the several States, he could only say no such
                            Jackson men could be found in Indiana.140
                  
                    
                
            In his campaign for a seat in congress, Lane favored a Bank of the 
                        United States
                     with restrictions. He would apportion the capital stock among the states according to
                    representation in congress, and limit the number of shares an individual might hold. Foreigners
                    should be incapable of holding stock, but should be allowed five years to dispose of their shares.
                    The Bank should be prohibited from holding real estate, for that "privilege has converted
                    the Bank into a speculator and a landlord with numerous and dependant tenantry." Finally,
                    the stock should "be liable by state laws to the same tax as other funded
                        property."141
            
            On March 29, 1834, Lane wrote a letter which received a great deal of publicity and occasioned much
                    comment. The following paragraph is significant: 
                        Some definite proposition for chartering a new bank, will be brought forward; properly
                            guarded and restricted, so as to render it the servant of, and not the master power in the
                            government. An institution, in strict obediance to, and not above the constitution and the
                            laws-an institution that shall furnish a sound currency, and relieve the country from its
                            present suffering; an institution that shall collect, keep and disburse the revenue of the
                            nation, with ease and safety; an institution for the benefit of the people, for
                                all, and not for the few.
                  
                    
                
            "For such an institution", said Lane, "my exertions and vote shall be
                    given." Although "the sins of the present bank" prevented its recharter,
                    "Public and individual necessity may, however, call for the temporary extension of its
                    charter," until "a new and safe one can be brought into action and useful
                        operation."142
            
            
               Niles' Register alluded to Lane's letter as "a curious

                        The Lynchburg Virginian refers to Mr. Lane's letter, and lays great stress upon it,
                            as the 
                                United States

                                propriety of any one's trying to make Mr. Lane speak for his party or for Gen.
                                Jackson.
                     144
                  
                    
                
            Soon afterwards, April 21, 1834, Lane wrote a similar letter to William J. Brown of 
                        Rushville
                    , in which he expressed the opinion "that a bank of some kind will be chartered
                    before the session closes."145 "The Bank has set the authority
                    of this House at defiance", he wrote May 30 to the editor of the Palladium; it "has refused, utterly refused, to submit to any examination, or to give
                    any evidence … before the committee of this House." This was proof enough, he
                    thought, that the Bank had violated its charter, corrupted the press, interfered with elections,
                    caused distress, and created loss of confidence.146
            
            But if Lane was apparently out of harmony with the administration in predicting that some kind of a
                    bank would be continued, he stood firmly for the policy of removing the deposits. He had not been in
                    congress more than a month before he congratulated 
                        the House on the recovery of the lost Treasury of the 
                                United States
                            . Where is the Treasury? has long been asked by all. Where is the Treasury? ay,
                            where is the Treasury? The Treasury is at length found. The President has seized it from the
                            grasp of those with whom it was lost, and borne it off in triumph. The Government can now
                            preserve the Treasury; the people can know where it is to be found; and the nation can have
                            the advantage of it. Nine millions of the people's money has been
                            at last recovered. Old Hickory can rejoice every day he sees it, and the people can look to
                            their beloved and determined President to guaranty its safety from the speculations of bank
                            jobbers…. Let there be great joy, from 
                                Georgia
                             to 
                                Maine
                            , that the Treasury is rich, and bountifully replenished.147
                  
                    
                
            Lane vehemently opposed the resolutions censuring Jackson introduced in the house by Wise,148 and voted to table the

                     senate's joint resolution disapproving removal of the
                    deposits. However, he had no objection to inquiry into the condition of deposit banks, for he
                    believed them solvent.149
            
            After returning to Indiana following the close of his first session in congress, Lane inquired
                    "into the social and general condition of the country", and on July 30, 1834, he
                    wrote a long letter to Francis P. Blair, editor of the 
                        Washington
                    
                    Globe. There was no section of the West, he said, which produced as much surplus
                    for market as southeastern Indiana. Yet he had not found 
                        a single individual who has not informed me that he obtained as fair, if not a higher price
                            for his articles at 
                                New Orleans
                             than at any former period…. Labor is in great demand at higher
                            prices than at any former times. Money was never in more abundance. The merchants, yes, 
                                Clay
                             merchants, say they never made better collections than during the last winter
                            and spring, or had fewer suits to force payments.
                        The river is in fine boating order. The prospect of an abundant crop of corn, is flattering.
                        How I should like to see a delegation composed of Bank attorneys and panic speech makers,
                            with Mr. Clay at their head, all under the command of Admiral Biddle, and after traversing
                            the rich valley of the 
                                Ohio
                             and 
                                Mississippi
                             and witnessing on every side, health, peace, plenty, and one widespread scene
                            of universal prosperity and ease, fall in with the amiable, talented, and patriotic Taney on
                            some elevated situation, overlooking the entire picture. Think ye, they would look him in
                            the face without a blush. Would they reject him from his elevated position or would they not
                            cower beneath even his modest gaze, retire in shame, covered with guilty blushes, from the
                            bright and cheering prospect, and flee from the presence of an insulted People, upon whom
                            they have labored so ardently to bring ruin and desolation.
                    
                
            By a judicious selection of deposit banks, Lane believed that the secretary of the treasury could
                    "secure the revenue and create as sound and uniform a currency for all domestic and
                    mercantile purposes, as ever was furnished by the 
                        United States
                     Bank". Money "deposited with them, will be loaned to the People, the
                    farmer, the mechanic, the young and enterprising trader and merchant." The 
                        United States
                     Bank, on the contrary, "belongs to English noblemen, lords, and bankers, and a
                    few American capitalists, whose interest and feeling are identified with them. Their loans are made
                    to the rich, to stock-jobbers and brokers, to gambling politicians, and 
                  
                     149
                            Ibid. 334.
               
                     such editors as could be ‘bought and sold as cattle
                    in the market.’"150
            
            In June, 1836, Lane assumed charge of the senate bill "to regulate the deposits of the
                    public money," and directed its course through the house, where it passed, 155 to 38.151
            
            In his campaign for reëlection in 1835, Lane again made an extensive canvass of the fourth
                        district.152 His opponent was George H. Dunn, "a solid,
                    undemonstrative attorney from the old 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     bar".153 The contest was close, and Lane received a
                    majority of only 82 votes out of nearly 10,000 cast.154 A solid Jackson
                    delegation was returned to congress from Indiana.155
            
            In the national contest of 1836, which began in earnest in 1835, Lane made "long and
                    loud" speeches for 
                        Van
                     Buren and Johnson.156 In May, 1835, he published a campaign
                    circular which began by praising Jackson's administration: 
                        The character and opinions of that great man were formed, in immediate contact with the
                            people, and a mind remarkable for rapidity, compass, and accuracy of thought, has enabled
                            him to administer the Government solely for their benefit. Beset by every influence that
                            could persuade or alarm, he has in every prominent measure, gone beyond his advisors, and
                            the wisdom of his decisions is best proved by the approbation of the people. He has shown,
                            that common sense Democratic principles are not mere professions, but practical and certain
                            guides in the most difficult affairs. He has restored to us confidence and unanimity, and
                            fixed the great landmarks of our future course.
                    But the Whigs were strong in talents, wealth, newspapers, and privileged institutions, he
                    warned, and a congressional cabal was laboring to barter the presidency in the house of
                    representatives. He pleaded for unity in the approaching election; "all personal
                    prejudices, and all private piques, should be un-hesitatingly sacrificed. It is a question, not of
                    persons, but of measures…. it is of less consequence who is elected than by whom he is
                    elected." If, however, the choice should

            In the congressional election of 1837, Lane and Dunn were again opposing candidates. Lane announced
                    42 speaking engagements, covering a period from June 10 to July 22. He had not intended to canvass
                    the district, he said, as every one knew "his fitness or unfitness" for the
                    position he sought. But the "fearful and alarming" financial situation in the
                    state demanded that he "give correct information to the people, in order that the
                    individuals who have brought them into so much difficulty, and embarrassment, and the State to the
                    verge of bankruptcy and dishonor, shall be made to stand forth in bold relief, before an insulted
                    and oppressed people."159 Dunn's majority was more than a
                    thousand, though Lane carried 
                        Dearborn county
                     by nearly four hundred.160 The Indiana Democrat
                    was "sorry to say that Mr. Dunn used such means to succeed, as cannot be
                        justified."161 Of the seven Jackson men elected in 1835, only
                    Ratliff Boon survived.162
            
            INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS IN INDIANA
            Soon after his defeat Lane formed a lam partnership with Richard H. Holman.163 He
                    had no intention, however, of retiring from politics. He had now an able political lieutenant in his
                    third son, James H. Lane, postmaster at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    ,164 a member of the "Select Council",165 and town "Recorder".166 By invitation
                    Amos Lane addressed the Democratic county convention, March 30, 1839, "and spoke for nearly
                    an hour, in his usual able and eloquent manner."167 The list of
                    delegates appointed to attend the district convention, to be held at Napoleon, 
                        Ripley County
                    , on April 15, included two of his sons, George W. and James H. It is quite probable

                            Beacon, April 6. 1839.
               
                     the elder Lane did not seek the congressional nomination at the
                    Napoleon convention. The 
                  
                            Dearborn County
                         Democrat observed that "there was one strong objection, and but one,
                    to urge against him—that was, that for the past eight years
                    
                        Dearborn County
                     has had the Representative in Congress, and the other counties thought it high time
                    that the Representative should hail from some other portion of the District."168 The convention nominated Thomas Smith of 
                        Ripley County
                    . The selection was ridiculed by the Political Beacon, a 
                        Lawrenceburg
                     Whig paper. It was charged that he had "on more than one occasion, spurned the
                    tramels of Party, and voted with the Whigs—and that too when his
                    political friends most needed his support." It continued: 
                        Upon the whole, we are much pleased with the nomination; because, with such a competitor, the
                            Whigs cannot fail to achieve an easy victory. Had Mr. Lane been nominated we should perhaps
                            have felt it our duty to buckle on our armor, and prepare for a vigorous
                            contest—for, say what you will, we regard him as the most prominent man of that
                            party in the District, and one who would be the hardest to beat.169
                  
                    
                
            George H. Dunn was again nominated by the Whigs, and it was charged that Lane was secretly supporting
                    him. J. H. Lane, "the political thermometer of his father," was said to have
                    stated to several members of that party in 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , "that his father wished Mr. Dunn to beat Smith one or two
                        hundred votes more than Dunn had beaten him at the previous election—that his father
                        understood his interest too well to want Smith elected".170
                    The contest resulted in a Democratic victory.
            On May 18, 1839, the 
                        Dearborn county
                     Democratic convention nominated Lane for the lower house of the general assembly.171 The important issue was the internal improvement policy embodied in the
                    "Mammoth bill" of 1836. In the congressional contest of 1837 both candidates
                    agreed that the "system" should be checked.172 In the canvass
                    of 1839 twenty-five residents of the county requested that Lane present his views to the public
                    "in reference to such subjects as will probably be discussed before, and the policy which
                    ought to be

                     adopted by, the next General Assembly." Lane consented
                    and immediately announced sixteen appointments, believing it his duty to "expose that
                    policy, that system, and its authors, to public view." He admitted that no political party
                    was solely responsible for the untimely policy, and he therefore invited all to attend who wished
                    "to be correctly informed of the common danger, and of the only mode of
                        escape."173
            
            The Political Beacon ridiculed the public call for Lane to canvass the county. The
                    Democrats, fearing defeat, only wished to provide "some plausible pretext … for
                    Mr. Lane to mount the stump, and harangue the people."174 The Democrat said of the Whigs, "Any man but Lane, is their rallying
                        cry."175 Nothwithstanding the efforts of the latter, 
                        Dearborn
                     returned a delegation of four Democrats to the lower house, albeit Lane stood third on
                    the list.176
            
            Though Lane was suggested for the speakership, and probably desired the chair,177
                    James G. Read, unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1831 and 1834, was chosen. Lane was made
                    chairman of the important committee on canals and internal improvements.178
                    "In that capacity," the 
                  
                            Dearborn County
                         Democrat wrote, probably to save his face, "he can serve the people
                    much better than in the Speaker's chair; and we have little doubt but he of choice would
                    have preferred the station. The people may now expect that nothing connected with ‘the
                    system’ will escape the most searching scrutiny."179
            
            The legislature of 1839-1840 was "one of very limited ability."180 In many respects Lane was the most outstanding member. The 
                        Indianapolis
                     correspondent of the 
                        Madison
                     Courier called attention to 
                        the appearance of a venerable looking man in the extreme corner to the left of the
                            Speaker's Chair; from his ‘furrowed cheeks and lint-white
                            locks’ you will readily conclude that Time his touched him With a heavy hand; but
                            be not impatient. Keep your eye steadily upon the man… He is moving toward the
                            aisle; he speaks; his voice is almost inaudible;—but now it swells to a shrill,
                            clear tone, as he warms, and advances in the discussion of his subject; … the
                            fire and vigor of

                             youth are animating him, and he seems to have forgotten
                            that he is an aged man. If the contractor's relief is his subject, he portrays, in
                            glowing colors, his sufferings; the plighted faith of the State; and denounces in terms of
                            bitterness, the ‘State Scrip’ system, as one that would prove ruinous
                            in its consequences to that portion of the community which it was intended to
                            benefit—the laboring portion, that has thrown up our embankments, and excavated
                            our canals. Such is a brief outline of the Hon. Amos Lane, of 
                                Dearborn county
                            . His position is indeed an elevated one, standing as he does, decidedly
                            foremost in either party, in either branch of the General Assembly. Possessed of an almost
                            inexhaustible fund of political knowledge, he is ever ready to advocate or oppose, from
                            fixed and settled principles, any measure of importance that may be presented for his
                            consideration. In short, his mind is replete with the rich and well treasured stores of
                            forty years experience; and notwithstanding weight of years hang heavily upon him, he still
                            retains the energy and vivacity of youth.181
                  
                    
                
            Lane's report on internal improvements, eighteen pages long in the House Journal, 182 is an elaborate treatment of the subject, embodying a
                    history of "the system," a statement of present status, and recommendations for
                    the future. The scheme, he said, emanated not from the people, but from Governor Noah Noble,
                    "in all the force of language and official influence." A bill providing for
                    surveys and estimates was rushed through the legislature, followed by a campaign of propaganda to
                    convince the people that the enterprise should be undertaken. The committee on canals and internal
                    improvements, as well as the governor, had assured them that the financial problem was a simple one.
                    He produced evidence to show the fallacy in the assertions of Noble and Chief Engineer Jesse L.
                    Williams, "that the works, as soon as completed, would be sources of revenue."
                    Even the improvements in 
                        New York
                     were not self-sustaining. The "fatal error," however, was the
                    prosecution of each work as a separate enterprise, with no coördination of the whole.183
            
            Before the "Mammoth bill" was passed, 
                        the people were in the full enjoyment of peace, independence, prosperity, and happiness. The
                            State of Indiana was one inclined plane—every avenue to immigration was

                             full to overflowing—it poured in upon us,
                            like the streams from an hundred hills upon the valleys. To be a citizen of Indiana, was to
                            be respected and honored at home and abroad. The credit of the State was sound and full, and
                            as the giant queen of the West, she was covered with one bright cloud of glory.184
                  
                    
                
            The picture of the present was somber in contrast: 
                        A foreign State debt hanging over her head, and resting upon her people; the system fallen
                            beneath its own weight; and nothing left but an excavation here, and embankment there;
                            forests plundered and quarries taken from their owners, farms divided and fields laid waste;
                            laborers turned out of employ, for want of ability in the State to pay. The people in debt,
                            and our courts crowded with suitors; property sacrificed; an inventory taken of the
                            farmer's land, his flocks and his herds; of the merchant's goods, the
                            mechanic's tools, and the widow's mite, by some rude assessor, and a
                            collector of taxes darkening every cabin door. The industry of the citizen checked; the
                            enterprise of the people slackened; a mortgage resting upon every land-holder's
                            farm; the State without credit, and a dark cloud of dismay hanging over her territory.185
                  
                    
                
            But what of the future?
            
                    Let every native and adopted citizen of Indiana double his industry, observe the most rigid
                        economy in his expenses, and go to work with renewed and increased energy, full of hope and
                        confidence…. Let every Hoosier son ‘pledge his life, his fortune, and his
                        sacred honor,’ … to pay the interest on the bonds sold, for which we have
                        realized the consideration, and like a good citizen and patriot, let each bear his burden with
                        patience. But on the bonds sold upon credit, for which nothing has been realized, let each make
                        up his mind never to pay the first farthing of interest, or the first dollar of principal, until
                        the full consideration shall be received.186
               
                
            The committee recommended to the house a reorganization of the board of fund commissioners, the
                    engineering department, and the board of internal improvements; the completion of the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Erie
                     canal from 
                        Terre Haute
                     to the state line; and the prosecution of two other works, should the next legislature
                    deem it expedient, selected with due regard to the amount of money required for completion, and the
                    estimated revenue they would furnish after finished.187 Lane himself introduced
                    "a bill to dissolve the present Board of Internal Improvement, the Board of Fund
                    Commissioners and the Engineer

                    on February 24,1840.189
            
            During his campaign for a seat in the legislature, Lane became involved in a quarrel with 
                        Milton
                     Gregg, editor of the Political Beacon, which arose out of their past
                    records on internal improvements. Amos Lane, "the great Ajax Telamon of the
                    Party," met Gregg on the street and opened fire. "Alarmed at you
                    sir! says he, and then kind reader, it would have made your hair stand on end to witness the
                    volley which was poured in upon us. Talked about liar, and damned
                    liar,—would give us a d—d whipping if we told any lies about
                    him—had a great mind to do it anyhow—would if we said much, &c.
                    &c. In short he rolled out such a string of expletives on this occasion as would have
                    beggared the vocabulary of Dr. Duncan himself."190 In a subsequent
                    issue of his paper, Gregg devoted five columns of the first page to an "Address to the
                    People." In a recent speech at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    , Lane had assailed him "with a string of vindictive and unmitigated
                    abuse," and compared him "with such distinguished personages as Benedict Arnold and Judas Iscariot." In reply, Gregg reviewed Lane's
                    career as an advocate of internal improvements, printed in full his speech of welcome to De Witt
                    Clinton in 1825, and explained why "Ajax Telamon," "whose voice has often
                    resounded through the lofty dome of the American Capitol!" now condescended to seek a seat
                    in the lower house of the state legislature: "Methinks I see him fixing his ardent gaze
                    upon the gilded and gorgeous trappings of executive office, and executive honor; and if I am not
                    much mistaken, it is through this channel that he hopes ultimately to arrive at the gubernatorial
                    chair of Indiana."191
            
            That Lane hoped to be governor cannot be doubted. Scattered items in various newspapers suggested him
                    as a possible candidate for that office,192 and the

                    an issue.193 Lane addressed the state Democratic convention at

                     Tilghman A. Howard was nominated for governor.194 Lane made a vigorous campaign for both state and national candidates,195 but the enthusiasm of the Whigs resulted in wholesale defeat for the Democrats.
            THE CLOSING YEARS.
            Lane had passed the three-score mark when he retired from the general assembly in 1840. By that time
                    he had acquired a competence estimated at $20,000.196 He continued to
                    practice law for at least six years, and in 1848 he was serving as postmaster at 
                        Lawrenceburg
                    .197 Although he never again held an elective office, his political
                    battles were not over with the campaign of 1840. Four years later Omar F. Roberts, subsequently a
                    judge of the 
                        Dearborn county
                     circuit court, 198
                    
                        heard Lane deliver one of his powerful philippics against the Whig party. It was in 
                                Wilmington
                            , the old capital of 
                                Dearborn
                            , at a pole raising. All day long the Democrats had been toiling to raise a
                            pole. Twice it had broken and as often had been spliced. The Whigs, naturally enough,
                            taunted the Democrats with their bad luck, but finally, about ten o'clock at night,
                            patience triumphed and a Polk and Dallas flag waved from the pole. Lane was the orator of
                            the occasion. He was then old, but the taunts of the Whigs raised the fire of youth in the
                            old man. Lane took his stand in the country farm wagon that stood by the side of the street.
                            It was ten o'clock at night when he began his speech, under a full moon that shone
                            in splendor upon the scene. Never will I forget the occasion. I can see that grand old man
                            as he stood there before that audience of spellbound spectators, with his white locks being
                            waved in the moonlight by the evening breeze, giving utterance to some of the most eloquent
                            periods that ever fell upon the ears of a Hoosier assemblage. It abounded in sarcasm, wit,
                            pathos, poetry, legal lore and statesmanship, carrying conviction to the hearts of all who
                            heard him.199
                  
                    
                
            Lane made an extensive campaign for Polk and Dallas in Indiana. On July 13, 1844, he addressed a
                    letter to the presidential nominee in which he recalled their services in the house of
                    representatives, 1833-1834: 
                        This may be said to have been a period that put to Test the political integrity of men. It
                            was in that Congress that Genl. Jackson learned

                            that Congress that the friends of Democracy were not only weighed in the balance, but had to
                            pass through the political furnace. And the many doubted, while others deserted, the
                            principle of equal rights and equal privileges. Still a sufficient No. stood by their
                            principle, their Country and Gallant Chief, to enable him most Gloriously to triumph over
                            monopoly, the Bank and her bought up attorneys, speakers and bribed presses.
                    
                
            Lane praised Polk's past record and predicted that during his "Administration, the
                    Eagle shall be able to Perch on the Loftiest Peak of the Rockey Mountains while
                    the Star Spangled banner shall waive in every valley on every hill and mountain of Oragon and 
                        Texas
                    ." Never before had the Indiana Democracy been "so perfectly
                    united," and as for Lane himself, "no one of the public men of our country could
                    have drawn forth from him a more untiring effort than yourself, in whom principle, Patriotism and
                    warm personal friendship are so happily united." Lane received invitations from all parts
                    of the state to make addresses. "I have not a day or an hour I can call my own….
                    On Saturday 20 we have an union mass meeting at Harrison on the line of In [diana] and 
                        Ohio
                    , on Monday I shall address the people of the county at 
                        Wilmington
                    , in answer to Gov. Corwin of 
                        Ohio
                     & Machead of 
                        Kentucky
                    , … On Tuesday I leave for the 
                        Wabash
                     and shall spend some weeks in that part of the State." He then added as a
                    post-script: "I perfectly recollect on a particular occasion saying to Mrs. Polk that when
                    she should preside at the White House I should call on her. May
                    Heaven send it a prophetic remark—Say to her if life be spared I will keep my
                        word."200
            
            On November 6,1844, he sent Polk the election news: "We have had a hard fight, and enough is
                    known to justify the firm belief it [Indiana] has gone for P. & Dallas…. Penn is
                    safe, no news from N.Y. or 
                        Virginia
                    ."201
            
            For three years after the election of 1844 the records are silent regarding Lane's
                    activities. In the summer of 1847 he spent several weeks in 
                        Washington
                    , where he frequently visited the president and secretary of war.202
                    His object was to secure a contract to furnish the adjutant general with from 1,000 to 10,000 tons
                    of hay at $16 a ton, delivered at New

                        Buena Vista
                    , it was believed, were slighted in General Taylor's report.204
            
            In his letters to his son, the elder Lane expressed himself freely upon the political situation at 
                        Washington
                    . Many Whigs, he said, "would sell destroy and damn their country if its
                    disgrace would elect that old fire eating [Taylor] President—in fact the leading Whigs
                    are the blackest Traitors to this country and ought to be hung."205

                    army…. Cass is doing all he can in the Senate at the head of the Military
                    Committee." Calhoun "has proven himself a dotard and insane on arbitration. In
                    fact of all the statesmen on earth he has changed oftenest and accomplished least—He has
                    yet to go with my one administration for a term…. he is a most perfect windmill a perfect

                    election he will be beaten on it—Taylor in all probability will be the candidate, and if
                    so if Cass is ours we shall be beaten—For if they have a war candidate we must
                        also."206 Later in the campaign Lane assured Thomas Ritchie of the
                        Union that Indiana would give Cass a majority of 10,000.207 The prophecy was substantially correct; Cass's Plurality over General Taylor was
                        5,000.208
            
            Amos Lane did not long survive the election of 1848, as he died on September 2 of the following
                        year.209 His long political career had been a stormy one. Assertive,
                    contentious, provocative, vindictive, he had both faithful friends and implacable foes among his
                    constituents in southeastern Indiana. Although he possessed a violent and ill-governed temper, on
                    occasion he evinced a dignity of manner, a serenity of spirit, and an honesty of purpose that were
                    admirable. He was neither learned nor profound, yet many of his congressional debates and stump
                    speeches reveal a comprehensive knowledge

                     of vital issues in which the West was interested. His speeches
                    were often merely caustic arraignments of political enemies, full of emotion and indignation. He was
                    a master in the use of invective, his language was ready and fluent, his vocabulary bristled with
                    expletives. Six feet tall, erect in stature, commanding in appearance, aggressive in manner, with
                    piercing blue eyes and gray locks, he made a remarkable impression upon western audiences. With a
                    minimum of formal education, he was essentially a product of the frontier.
            The elder Lane entered national politics too late in life to attain a place of importance. But he
                    transmitted to his son, James H. Lane, many of his characteristics, and his own political career
                    opened the way for the younger Lane's entrance into politics. By inheritance and
                    association the son acquired the political acumen, the manner of speech, and an understanding of
                    frontier influences that made him a dominating personality in the 
                        Kansas
                     struggle of a later decade. The essential traits which he displayed as the fiery leader
                    of the Free-State party and as a radical agitator of the Civil War period, had their antecedents in
                    the elder Lane's political career.
         
         
         
            Early Schools of 
                        Franklin County
                    
            
            By MICHAEL BOSSERT
            
            
               
                        Dearborn County
                    , of which 
                        Franklin County
                     was at first a part, was organized by proclamation of Governor William Henry Harrison
                    on March 7th, 1803, but all its county records were burned in 1826. Practically all 
                        Franklin County
                     history prior to that date, however, is based on fairly reliable traditions.
            Three distinct human factors left their traces on 
                        Franklin County
                     schools. These were the 
                        Kentucky
                    -Carolina factor, the Middle Atlantic-
                        New England
                     factor and the 
                        German
                     factor. The very earliest settlers were 
                        Kentucky
                     backwoods-men, probably not much more advanced and probably not much more retarded than
                    the mountain people we now receive from the same state. These settled along the Whitewater from
                    Cleves, 
                        Ohio
                    , to above 
                        Brookville
                    . Some of these were squatters, furtraders, or "squawmen," like John
                    Conner, who traded near where Cedar Grove now stands before the opening of the nineteenth century.
                    Most of the early comers were restless, land hunting, Eldorado seeking people, now here, now there.
                    Much has been said, in justice, of their courage, pluck, endurance and other qualities, but it is
                    only a matter of history to add that many followed the lines of least resistance. It was often
                    easier to move and take new claims than to pay for old or pay taxes, light as they were, on old
                    claims. The Carolinians also came very early, and formed settlements along the Whitewater, on Blue
                    Creek and at 
                        Fairfield
                    .
            Between 1810 and 1820, there was an emigration to the county from 
                  New
                        England, New York
               , and especially
                    from 
                        New Jersey
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . Mixed with the three groups from older States were a few Hessians, assimilated into
                    the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Dutch element by this time, but with similar views and ambitions to those with whom
                    they settled.
            Since the schools of 
                        New England
                     and the Middle Atlantic States stood higher at this time than did those of the
                    Carolinas and Kentucky, one may infer that the second wave ranked higher educationally than the
                    first. However, some men included  among both the 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     settlers were men of college training.
            The early county maps show the characteristic southern and eastern family names. There appear such as
                    McCarty, Fuller, Breckenridge, Hackleman, Cooksey, Stoops, Wilson, Robinson, Jackson, Grant, etc. As
                    late as 1850, substantial farms were owned by a George Washington, an Andrew Jackson and a Nicholas
                    Longworth. But there was also a Halberstadt, a Siebenthaler, and others with similar names at a very
                    early time.
            In 1811 
                        Franklin County
                     "became independent". Its first tax duplicate shows practically none
                    but 
                        Kentucky
                     and Carolina names. Nothing was taxed save horses, mules,
                    slaves—thirty-seven and one-half cents for horses, one dollar per stallion, and fifty
                    cents for a bond servant. No part of the vast revenues thus obtained was intended for schools.
            How was the splendid vision of an educational system for-shadowed in the Ordinance of 1787 to become
                    a reality? The local schools were to be nurtured by the sale of section sixteen of each
                    Congressional Township. These sections, at the rate at which land was then selling, would have
                    brought from $1200 to $1600. The section sixteen which was located in 
                        Highland
                     Township, one of the best in that unit, would at its present valuation run the schools
                    of that township less than three years. The same act of Congress which granted the lands gave the
                    salt springs to the people of the State for school purposes. As far as 
                        Franklin County
                     was concerned, it might just as well have given all the gold and diamond mines also, as
                    none of these "wonderful springs" existed in the County.
            The County seminaries, second "step in the educational ladder", were to be provided
                    "by moneys paid in lieu of military service and fines assessed for breach of penal
                    laws". "Proceeds of fines and forfeitures" are always small and
                    seminaries were put on a precarious footing.
            Much has been said of the farsightedness of the framers of the Ordinance of 1787 in regard to what
                    they did for education. Judged by our standard their plans or hopes seem entirely inadequate. None
                    could have dreamed of systems such as we have now. None had seen any but the simplest of schools.
                    Their great work consisted in suggesting a public  school
                    system, which would have to be supported in part at least by local units of government through
                    general taxation.
            To provide for starting a system of schools, the early courts appointed overseers or superintendents
                    and dictated rules for renting and leasing. Nothing is said about the terms, duties, or salaries of
                    the officials. Prabably they were mere creatures of the courts with little power and short tenure
                    something like our boards of charities at the present time. The Congressional Townships were kept
                    separate and distinct from the Civil Townships. This probably did not matter where the two types
                    happened to coincide, but in 
                        Franklin County
                     as elsewhere this was true in only a few cases. Brook-ville Township is composed of
                    parts of six Congressional Townships. This phase of the system could only add to the general
                    confusion.
            Only a small amount of revenue came in from the sale of the Sixteenth Sections, none from salt lands,
                    while the proceeds of fines and forfeitures were small. Even the distribution under Jackson of a
                    part of the $38,000,000 Treasury surplus to the various states, and Indiana's
                    wise decision to put her share amounting to about $1,000,000 into a school fund could not
                    help much. Local taxation was badly needed, but early Indiana was not ready for that. During the
                    entire period which this paper attempts to cover, that from 1811 to 1850, available school funds
                    were always pitifully small and the best schools depended in part on fees.
            Long before the land grant sections were sold, schools sprang up in many parts of 
                        Franklin County
                    . Some of these must have been established at a very early date. William McClure in his
                        Memoirs tells that he went to school near where Cedar Grove now stands with
                    James Conner, a half-breed Indian boy, and others in 1811-12. These schools were all subscription
                    schools open for very short terms. No records were kept and the first rooms were usually rented
                    wherever some wandering teacher could muster a sufficient number of pupils.
            It may be interesting to note where, according to "traditional history", the first
                    school houses stood in each Township. 
                        Bath
                     Township, in the southeast quarter of Section 36, on land now owned by Edith Gentry,
                    has the honor of establishing the first school. The earliest regular school house, however, was
                    where the town of Mixerville now stands. Both  structures were
                    built of logs. The first in Blooming Grove Township was built in 1817 or 1818, about a mile east of
                    the present town of Blooming Grove in the Harvey (
                        South Carolina
                     settlers) neighborhood. 
                        Brookville
                     Township was early settled, and probably had several schoolhouses at an early date, one
                    of which stood west of 
                        Brookville
                    , in the Stoops neighborhood. This was built by 1810 and was a typical example. It had
                    an earthen floor, puncheon furniture, and no windows, the light being admitted through oiled paper
                    or similar material where a log had been omitted, or a section cut out, in the wall. Along the wall
                    under this opening was placed a high puncheon desk where pupils stood to write.
            
               
                        Butler
                     Township, then a part of Ray Township, started its educational history with a log
                    schoolhouse near the mouth of Clear Fork. 
                        Fairfield
                     Township had a schoolhouse on Templeton's Creek before 1830, and another near
                    Sim's Cemetery across the line in the present Union County at a much earlier date. As this
                    Township was settled in 1804, there were probably very early subscription schools. 
                        Highland
                     Township had schools at a very early date east of South Gate, on Blue Creek, or perhaps
                    first of all, on Goble's Creek near the southeast corner of Section Sixteen. A map of 1858
                    still locates this one. One of its "graduates", Uncle John Klemme, now
                    ninety-eight years of age "completed" his schooling here in twelve days. 
                        Laurel
                     Township had a schoolhouse with a dirt floor in 1812 on the present site of the town of 
                        Laurel
                    ; Meta-mora Township, then a part of 
                        Laurel
                     Township, one on the "Gordon Farm" built about 1820 or 1825; Posey
                    Township, settled later, had two by 1830, one near Andersonville, and one in the extreme southeast
                    part of the township; Salt Creek Township had its first schoolhouses in the Hawkins neighborhood and
                    in the Stipps Hill vicinity. Ray Township, only thinly settled by the early southern and eastern
                    wave, has left no story of early schools. 
                        Springfield
                     Township had one on Section 24 by 1814, and Whitewater Township started with one at New
                    Trenton, and soon after added one on Elkhorn Creek. Uncle Ab Case, who died at the age of nearly one
                    hundred some years ago, told the writer that once while the first New Trenton schoolhouse was being
                    repaired, the pupils met and recited in the hollow trunk of a gigantic sycamore tree which lay near
                    the little log school building. The town of 
                    
                        Brookville
                     opened its first school in the old log courthouse in 1816, and subscription schools,
                    now here, now there, usually in abandoned houses about town, were conducted from then on. Later the
                    town built a small brick school where the warehouse of Charles Masters now stands.
            In January, 1827, the Legislature passed an act to establish County Seminaries in several counties,
                    including 
                        Franklin
                    . The Circuit Court selected a board of three in 1828, and the new Seminary was ready
                    "to go" in 1830. This is according to Goodwin's notes in the 
                  
                            Franklin County
                         Atlas of 1882, but in the 
                        Brookville
                    
                    American of August 27, 1834, we find Rufus B. Haymond, secretary of the Board of
                    Trustees, advertising as follows: 
                        To Teachers:
                        Wanted, a gentleman of good moral character who is qualified to teach the English language
                            together with surveying, mathematics, etc. to take charge of the Seminary located at 
                                Brookville
                            , 
                                Franklin County
                            , Indiana. A person who in addition to the above qualifications is capable of
                            teaching the Greek and Latin languages would be preferred.
                    
                
            Whether a principal of the above description was then obtained is not known, but by March 20, 1835,
                    we find D. M. Stewart, A.B., a graduate of Miami University at 
                  Oxford, Ohio
               , and strongly
                    recommended by several of its faculty, advertising the opening on April 6, 1835, of the 
                        Brookville
                     Seminary for both sexes. Mrs. Stewart was to be in charge of the female department.
                    There may have been previous sessions, but nothing has been found concerning them. Principal Stewart
                    must have been in charge for several years as his name occasionally occurs in the files of the American.
            In March, 1842, M. W. Haile, a successor of Stewart, retired from the principalship, expressing the
                    fear that the school might become a part of the "public system". The American also feared this and wanted the school kept at its "present high
                    standard." The advertisement of Wm. J. Patterson follows and is of interest in connection
                    with growing tuition rates: 
                        The subscribed purposes opening a school in the seminary in 
                                Brookville
                            , Ind. on Monday, the 21 of March, 1842. Scholars will be received on the
                            following terms, viz:—For spelling, reading, writing and arithmetic,
                            $2.00 per quarter; Geography, English, Grammar, and History of U.S.
                            $2.50; Ancient and Modern History, Rhetoric and Natural Philosophy  $3.50, Algebra, Geometry, Greek and Latin
                            $4.50. Tuition paid at end of each quarter. Miss Jane P. Haile will give
                            instructions in the female department.
                    
                
            The Seminary was evidently never very prosperous. At times it was temporarily closed and inhabited
                    only by bats, screech-owls and stray cats and dogs, permitted to wander at will through its open
                    doors. Its equipment was meanwhile at the mercy of idle boys and tramps. The American of Sept. 1, 1848, charged that the Seminary had been almost ruined by politics,
                    asserting that the Democrats of 
                        Brookville
                     had used it to further partisan purposes only. The truth seems to be that the great
                    democratic movement was toward free public schools and away from the mock-aristocratic type which
                    the Seminary exemplified. Every period of depression was followed by another revival. Feeling
                    evidently that the curriculum needed bolstering, Prof. James Elliot advertised sessions of fourteen
                    weeks in August, 1848, with Plane Trigonometry, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Astronomy, Latin,
                    Greek and French, besides the usual subjects, all of which one could carry for $5.00 a
                    term. O. F. Fitch was principal the next year. Meanwhile a Seminary had been opened at 
                        Peoria
                     near the 
                        Ohio
                     line. 
                        Mt. Carmel
                     planned a seminary in 1849, but wisely changed it to a graded district school soon,
                    which became one of the best in the County.
            To get a definite picture of the Seminary, the term of 1845-1846 may be used. I. R. Goodwin was then
                    principal and Mary A. Brown assistant. If there were other teachers their names do not appear. The
                    term began on October 8, 1845. The enrollment, about equally divided between "male and
                    female", was about one hundred twenty for the term, but never more than sixty at one time.
                    The most surprising, almost unbelievable, thing is that the ages varied from four and five to
                    twenty-three. The school evidently was a kindergarten, elementary school, and high school combined
                    sailing under the name of "Seminary". Here was a chance at a liberal education all
                    in one building, with "The cat caught a rat" on the lowest step, and Greek, Latin
                    and Surveying on the highest. The term ended on July 20th.
            The Seminary maintained a struggling existence until the Constitution of 1851 provided for the sale
                    of Seminaries. Other principals, not mentioned above were, according to  Goodwin, Rev. Isaac A. Ogden, James B. Haile and George B. Chase. The
                    Seminary, in fact, did great and useful work during this chaotic, formative period. Toward the last
                    it aimed somewhat at the preparation of teachers for the district schools, a task it should have
                    taken up much earlier. Many teachers of the fifties and sixties "got their start"
                    at the Seminary. The old building still stands in the Whitewater Valley, a
                    plain two-story structure hardly more imposing than many little two-room school buildings of today
                    in the poorer rural districts.
            In another place it has been stated that the early judges appointed overseers or superintendents to
                    have charge of district schools. This is according to Goodwin's notes. By 1834, there were
                    both trustees of school districts and school commissioners. One of the latter was Samuel Sering, who
                    held his position for a number of years. The American of March 8, 1835, contained
                    the following, signed by J. Ryman: 
                        The trustees of Congressional Township No. 9 [in which 
                                Brookville
                             is located], Range 2 W. will meet on the 21 instant for the purpose of making
                            distribution of the School Fund of said Township for the past year. Teachers in making a
                            list of the pupils sent to their schools, will notice Sec. 185 of the act in-corporating
                            Congressional Townships, and providing for public schools therein, approved Feb. 2,
                        1833.
                    
                
            The statement of annual expenditures for the County for the year ending Sept. 1834, among many
                    others, contains the following items: 
                  
                     School Trustees
                     $4.00
                  
                  
                     School Commissioner
                     $6.00
                  
                  
                     Wolf scalps
                     $1.00
                  
                  
                     For 1835 these items were:
                      
                  
                  
                     School Trustees
                     $4.00
                  
                  
                     School Commissioner
                     $39.87 1/2
                  
                  
                     Wolf scalps
                     $9.50
                  
                  
                     For 1838:
                      
                  
                  
                     School Trustees
                     $7.50
                  
                  
                     School Commissioner
                     $33.00
                  
                  
                     Wolf scalps
                     $2.00
                  
                  
                     For 1839:
                      
                  
                  
                     School Trustees
                     $16.50
                  
                  
                     School Commissioner
                     $25.00
                  
                  
                     Wolf scalps
                     $4.00
                  
               
                     These records show that the office of school commissioner was
                    gradually becoming of more importance, but that the trustees were not yet much more important than
                    wolf scalps.
            One of the duties of the school commissioner was the sale of the land in the sections granted for
                    school purposes. The first sale of this kind which has been found was that advertised by Samuel
                    Sering for Feb. 25, 1835.
            
                    On Thursday, 26 of February 1835, at the Court House door in the County of 
                            Franklin
                        , I will offer for sale as provided by statute, School Section 16 [in 
                            Highland
                         Township, directly east of Klemme's Corner], in Township 8, Range 2 West.
                        Said land will be offered in lots of 40 acres each between the hours of 10 o'clock A.M.
                        and 4 P.M. on said day, and continue from day to day until all are offered.
                
            The school commissioner also advertised farms and lots delinquent on borrowed school money and taxes,
                    but not until delinquent three years. Sering advertised such a sale to take place on Dec. 25, 1835.
                    Some thirty persons were delinquent. This was an annual duty now taken over by Auditor, Clerk and
                    Sheriff.
            Since a taxpayer might be delinquent three years without being sold out, many evidently chose to
                    become so and then move on to another county where new land could be had for $1.25 an
                    acre. With taxes very low in 1836, there were more delinquent taxpayers in 
                        Franklin County
                     than in 1929 with taxes "sky high".

                        Springfield

                     Townships include portions of Congressional Townships that now lie partly in Union
                    County, their sixteenth sections were sold at Liberty. We have no record of the dates of these
                    sales.
            The dates of these sales are cited to show that, since the district schools depended mainly for their
                    support on the sales of sixteenth sections, schools prior to 1835, when the sales of school lands
                    began in 
                        Franklin County
                    , must have been maintained by subscription, while the buildings must have been rented
                    or donated by public spirited citizens. A building such as was then used could have been put up by
                    the men of a neighborhood in two or three days at practically no cost, the labor being donated. The
                    legislature of 1837 provided that a school district would receive its pro rata share only if it had
                    a term of three months or more. This was distinctly a forward step.
            The importance of the school trustees and of the commissioner seemed to wane rather than grow. The
                        American of May 31, 1839, points out the fact that the worthy commissioner
                    seemed to have no fixed place of residence. Like General Pope of Civil War fame, his headquarters
                    seem to have been in the saddle. Bitter opposition arose, and the trustees over the County
                    threatened to resign if Mr. Sering did not make Brook-ville or some other centrally located place
                    his home or maintain an office there. On July 22, 1842, the American declared:
                    "There is to be a school commissioner elected at the approaching August election. We have
                    heard of no candidate for the office. The office is worth little or nothing, but will do to satisfy
                    little aspirants." William Potts was such an aspirant and was elected. The stipend seems to
                    have been entirely in the form of fees, and very small fees at that. Under such
                    conditions—short terms, poor log buildings, low wages, etc.—one can imagine
                    that the district teachers were not of a very high class.
            
            The American of November 30, 1838, asks: "Have the citizens of the Seventh
                    School District of 
                        Springfield
                     Township a runaway negro slave in their employ as preceptor to their
                    children?" No one answered this question in the negative, thus leaving the impression that
                    this may have been the case.
            There is little to be said in favor of the dilapidated log schoolhouses of the day. Their windows
                    were curtainless, their floors of uneven loose puncheons. There were cracks and crevices everywhere;
                    there was no equipment and no course of study. There were, however, two redeeming features: the
                    great open fireplace as part of the structure and ventilating system; and mainly individual
                    instruction as part of the technique. Critics should not be too severe. The churches of the day were
                    of logs also, as were the jails, and even the courthouses. The comparison could be carried further,
                    and the fact stated that nine-tenths of the families lived in homes constructed of logs.
            That the courses of study were not elaborate was only natural. The 
                        Franklin County
                     settler was much more concerned with split rails for fences, and split clapboards for
                    roofs than with split infinitives. If teachers were poorly prepared for their vocations, so were
                    most lawyers, doctors, and preachers. We must remember that Indiana, so far as the Constitution or
                    the law is concerned, may start a crop of young lawyers each year, with no requirements except a
                    good moral character. Any one could be a doctor in early Indiana, while being moved by the spirit
                    was seemingly the only preparation that many had for the task of preaching in that period.
            In the district schools, there could have been little uniformity of courses nor was there uniformity
                    of textbooks, even in the same school. Mr. Harry Stoops has an assortment of books used in some of
                    the early schools of 
                        Brookville
                     Township. Included among them is the famous old 
                        New England
                     Primer in which the bold lion holds the lamb; in which appears "In
                    Adam's fall we sinned all"; and in which "Uriah's beauteous wife
                    made David seek his [not David's, but Uriah's] life". It is a volume of
                    which the page is hardly as large as the palm of a man's hand, and it is about one-half
                    inch thick. It was used as a speller, reader and catechism combined, and is  a book marked by a decidedly formidable religious undertone. Hardly a
                    Biblical name of prominence is omitted in the speller and most of the selections have to do with sin
                    or death. The edition is that of 1813.
            Webster's Elementary Spelling-book, first printed in 1803 or 1804, is a much more scholarly
                    book. The edition most used in early Indiana was that of 1816. It is a speller, interspersed with
                    stories and fables, like those credited to Aesop. It also contains maxims and sayings of the Poor
                    Richard type. There are also so-called "Useful Lessons" which deal with facts of
                    arithmetic, geography, other sciences, and morals as well. There was a sequel to this book, Webster's Speller and Definer, in reality a small dictionary of 172
                    pages. By 1845, over 400,000 copies of this book had been sold. It cost twenty cents.
            The "Complete Little Arithmetic", for thirty cents, was in much demand. Its purpose
                    is thus stated by the publishers: "Having heard it stated, that many of the children
                    residing in the remote and sparsely settled districts of our country, enjoy but few of the
                    advantages of a common school education, and that Webster's or some other spelling book
                    furnishes, in many instances, the only guide to book knowledge obtained, the idea [was adopted] of
                    [publishing] an Appendage therto in cheap form, to contain the elementary principles of Mental and
                    Practical Arithmetic with plain instructions for those who may be thus situated". Part One
                    of this has mental exercises in the fundamentals of arithmetic and in all the common weights and
                    measures. Part Two has "slate" exercises in the usual processes of arithmetic up
                    to and including the rule of three. The publishers of this mathematical treatise advertised a Wouldst Know Thyself, a physiology, but it is doubtful whether this subject was
                    taught in many rural schools of 
                        Franklin County
                    , before the Civil War.
            Lindley Murray's Grammar and his English Reader were probably used only in Seminaries and by
                    the most advanced students in district schools. The edition of 1831 was one of those formidable
                    readers of the elocution type so much favored in those days. Addison, Dr. Johnson, 
                        Milton
                    , Pope and Hume are the stars in its pages, together with Cicero, Plato, the Apostle
                    Paul, Pliny and Virgil. 
                        Milton
                    's "Morning Hymn" and Pope's "Universal
                    Prayer" are among the best  selections in this book. At
                    first thought, one can hardly see how students in short terms, with poor teachers could read, let
                    alone master such a book. The answer lies in this, that nearly all the time and energy was centered
                    on reading.
            These were not the only texts used. An advertisement in the 
                        Brookville
                    
                    American of April 27, 1835, strongly endorses Cobb's School Books
                    consisting of Speller, Juvenile Readers, Arithmetic and Orthoepy. They were sold by a Mr. Tyner and recommended by the principal of the academy and
                    the board members. The famous McGuffey Readers came later and swept aside all others. William H.
                    McGuffey was a professor at Miami University from 1826 to 1836, and later President of Cincinnati
                    College and 
                        Ohio
                     University, successively.
            Under the best planned and administered educational systems, maladjustments are certain to occur
                    sometimes, and not all boys and girls were equally touched by the stern, Puritanic course and
                    teaching of early days. Two instances may be cited to show that human nature has carried little in a
                    hundred years. In a copy of Lindley Murray's Reader, beside 
                        Milton
                    's conception of a conversation in Paradise between Adam and Eve, carried on in
                    magnificent Latinized Anglo-Saxon hardly compatible with human beings in the fig-leaf stage of
                    development, a boy of 1831 had slipped the following philosophical couplets: 
                        When boys go courting They dress so bright To hug the girls Is their delight.
                    
                
            In the 
                        Brookville
                    
                    American of May 9, 1834, B. G. Griffin inserted the following advertisement with
                    the offer of a reward of one cent: 
                        Run away on Aug. 25 last, John G. Griffin, son of Benj. Griffin, aged about 18 yrs. I hereby
                            forewarn all persons trusting or harboring said boy on my account, as I will pay no debts of
                            his contracting. The above reward but no thanks will be given for the return of said
                        boy.
                    
                
            On the other hand, the old subscription and sixteenth section schools with their primitive
                    surroundings often gave a good account of themselves. Under their educational opportunities lived
                    for a time or grew up in 
                        Franklin County
                    : Jesse B. Thomas, who later, while Senator from 
                        Illinois
                    , introduced  the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise; Judge Benjamin McCarty; Gen. Robert Hanna, college mate and personal friend
                    of Thomas Jefferson; Judge Charles H. Test; Gov. James Brown Ray; Gov. Noah Noble; David Wallace;
                    Gen. Lew Wallace; John A. Matson; James B. Eads; Gen. Pleasant A. Hackleman; Gov. J. P. St. John, of 
                        Kansas
                     fame, candidate for president in 1884; and Edgehill Burnside, father of Gen. Ambrose E.
                    Burnside who lost the ill-fated battle of Fredricksburg.
            We must always remember that the times were primitive and formative. Universities then attempted
                    hardly more than do high schools now. By November 14, 1834, ten years after it opened, Miami
                    University had two hundred ten students, eight from Indiana. One thousand volumes consituted the
                    library and a total income of $5,000 was available to pay fourteen professors. The
                    Governor of 
                        Rhode Island
                     then received the magnificent sum of $500 as an annual salary, and our own
                    Governor $1,000 with a per diem of $2.00 for traveling expenses. When we
                    remember that tavern rates were fixed by courts or law, and in spite of it were very low, that
                    "drinks" were given away on the "help yourself plan" by every
                    prosperous grocery, that it was easy to avoid paying bills or taxes, we can see that the cost of
                    living was low.
            There was never a lack of candidates for even the most insignificant office. It was a common
                    occurrence to have six to eight candidates for the office of representative from 
                        Franklin County
                     in the State legislature with similar numbers seeking like honors in 
                        Dearborn
                     and other counties. There was plenty of ambition and in many instances the best men
                    seem to have been chosen.
            The census of 1840 shows that the Indiana system had produced some results. The following figures on
                    illiteracy have been selected to show the standing of 
                        Franklin County

                        Franklin County
                     was very much lower than the average for the State, it will be noted.
            In the 'thirties a new factor entered the educational field of 
                        Franklin County
                     and has since then exerted considerable influence. The 
                        Kentucky
                    -Carolina waves of settlers had followed the Whitewater River and
                    its main tributaries, and had taken only part of the clay, oak and hickory uplands of
                            
                  Highland, Butler
               , Ray and Salt Creek Townships. Into these gaps swarmed Germans
                    of many types, Hessians, Bavarians and others. These had not been partly assimilated to American
                    life as had the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Dutch. They began to introduce a new system of locating school houses, the dorf or
                    village system. In their church communities, usually near the church, they started schools,
                    parochial or semi-parochial as the case might demand. They introduced better church buildings and
                    better school buildings also. Frequently stone or brick was the material used for their farm houses.
            The founding of the dorf system and the semi-independent church schools in the southwestern part of
                    the County was encouraged by the topography of the Country. The Whitewater
                    river was almost an impassible barrier a great part of the year. Even as late as 1849,
                    the American in speaking of the first cholera epidemic said: "There have
                    been many deaths across the Rhine [Whitewater] but we have little communications with that
                    region."
            In the late thirties or forties, the School Townships were made to coincide with Civil Townships, and
                    the real era of building public schoolhouses began. The exact date for this cannot be given, but, in
                    Ray Township, it was in 1846 or possibly 1848. This has been called the "stone
                    age" because of the little square stone buildings then erected in most of the southern and
                    western parts of the County. Elsewhere in the County, the new structures were of brick or frame.
            The checker-board plan of placing school houses is here exemplified. Whether those who planned them
                    thought that human beings would forever remain evenly distributed over a territory, or whether they
                    wished to follow Whittier's dictum, "A school house plant on every hill",
                    or Horace Mann's, "The public school houses are the Republic's most
                    important line of fortifications", is not known. The "forts" were built
                    at intervals of two miles. The County map of 1858 shows that the  "checker board system" was well under way; by 1865 it was as nearly complete as
                    it ever became. By that time, 
                        Bath
                     Township had five school buildings, Blooming Grove five, 
                        Brookville
                     eighteen, 
                        Butler
                     seven, 
                        Fairfield
                     three, 
                        Highland
                     eleven, 
                        Laurel
                     six, Metamora three, Posey six, Ray five, Salt Creek seven, 
                        Springfield
                     nine, and Whitewater eleven. The total population of 
                        Franklin County
                     in the fifties, sixties and seventies was much greater than at present. The highest
                    number of people reported in any census was 20,223 in 1870. The population had decreased to 14,806
                    in 1920.
            The dorf or village plan soon came into conflict with the checker board system. Evidently considering
                    what had been done before their arrival as "mere scraps of paper", the Teutons
                    immediately built village or parish schools and asked their church members to send their children to
                    these schools. Schools with two and three rooms thus appeared. School No. 1 in 
                        Highland
                     Township was removed to South Gate, St. Peters became No. 3, Oldenburg absorbed much
                    adjacent territory, 
                        Enochsburg
                    , 
                        Huntersville
                     and 
                        Hamburg
                     immediately established dorf schools. Other towns, not parish centers, saw the
                    advantages and adopted the system. 
                        Buena Vista
                    , Andersonville, Blooming Grove, 
                        Fairfield
                    , and New Trenton became village school centers. If this system could have been followed
                    through without regard to township lines, it would have been an ideal one. Consolidation by
                    townships came later, and the emphasis was again placed on the township.
            The system for measuring the intellectual achievements of teachers in vogue in early days is only
                    conjectural. Were the commissioners or trustees also examiners? Feb. 19, 1841, the Judges of the
                    Circuit Court appointed Moses J. Kelly, A. S. Babbott and John Wynn examiners. Nothing is given
                    about their qualifications or special fitness, or in regard to salary. Tradition tells us that
                    examinations were very informal. General appearance and personality as seen by the examiner counted
                    for more than "book larnin". One hopeful applicant, after being eyed for a time
                    like a horse for sale, was asked, "What would you do if the itch broke out in your
                    school?" He answered, "Use sulphur and molasses." He was passed. Another
                    applicant asked by an acquaiitance how he could manage to pass any examination shrewdly displayed a
                    five-dollar  bill. Probably all of the examinations were oral
                    and depended entirely on the character of the examiners.
            In the August election of 1848, there was a test vote on the question of free schools. The results in 
                        Franklin County
                     by townships were as follows:

            Metamora Township was still a part of 
                        Laurel
                    . Salt Creek, 
                        Brookville

                        Butler
                     Townships formed parts of 
                        Highland
                    , Ray, Salt Creek and Brookville Townships. The vote on free schools was not political.
                    The strongly "religious" townships voted against free schools, those not organized
                    as parishes for them. The same influences were apparent all over the State. Counties having colleges
                    voted decidedly against free schools—
                        Johnson County
                    , by a majority of 800; 
                        Monroe
                    , by 1071; 
                        Putnam
                    , by 1645; 
                        Montgomery
                    , by 1087. Evidently Caleb Mills and others of whom Indiana University is now so proud
                    had as yet little influence in 
                        Monroe County
                    . 
                        Dearborn County
                     showed a majority of 2168 for free schools, the largest in the State.
            On January 17, 1849, the Assembly passed a common school law. It proposed to increase the common
                    school fund by levying a tax of ten cents per hundred on property and a twenty-five cent poll tax.
                    It also taxed premiums of foreign insurance companies. Proceeds of these taxes, together with the
                    saline and surplus revenue funds and a bank tax were to form a county common school fund. The county
                    treasurer was placed in charge of the fund and made receiver of all money for school purposes. The
                    office of school commissioner was abolished, his duties being transferred to the county auditors and
                    treasurers. The law established a minimum term  of three months
                    and the township trustee was to arrange schools of equal terms in his districts. The townships were
                    divided into districts with district trustees elected by the voters on the first Monday in
                    September. The district trustee had practically complete charge of buildings, repairs, etc. He
                    reported to the board of township trustees, enumerated the pupils and reported enrollments.
                    Districts were arranged with regard to convenience of patrons. Voters of a district might vote money
                    and labor to build school houses up to fifteen cents per hundred dollars. Township trustees were
                    allowed seventy-five cents per day to be paid by the auditor from township funds, and they employed
                    the district trustees, who were paid from district money. The Treasurer of the State was also State
                    Superintendent. Finally, the law provided for an election in August, 1849, in which each county
                    should accept or reject the new plan.
            
               
                        Brookville
                     held its first district school election Saturday, Aug. 25, to elect a district school
                    trustee. The American took a progressive attitude, condemned Seminaries and
                    private schools and called all to rally to the new system. A Mr. Ryman was elected. The town and
                    community then had about 400 children of school age. In spite of the American,
                    George Bent undertook to continue the Seminary. 
                        Springfield
                     Township called a meeting on September 8 to advocate honorable means of retaining the
                    old system and old funds: To the citizens who assembled it looked like robbery to take away their
                    sixteenth section funds.
            On Monday, September 30, 1849, the first free school opened in 
                        Brookville
                     for pupils from five to twenty-one years of age. W. G. Terrell, the principal, taught
                    in the district schoolhouse and O. F. Fitch, his assistant, in the basement of the 
                        German
                     Methodist Church. These were the only teachers. The great
                    "Jacksonian" wave of democracy had at last triumphed in a free public school
                    system. The new constitution of 1850-1851 was a great triumph of the democratic wave, though a delay
                    of several years followed an adverse court decision.
            This sketch will close with the forties—those wild, exciting, troublesome times. The
                    Mexican War, the terrific attack of cholera and the gold fever tended to keep the public mind on
                    matters other than educational. The cholera, especially,  left
                    its marks in 
                        Franklin County
                     where hundreds died. Many others moved to newer areas. Some joined the 
                        California
                     gold-seekers.
            The decade from 1840 to 1850 was a transitional period in educational ideals. The religious, general
                    culture idea was being attacked. In June, 1849, Rev. Thomas H. Stockton was offered the presidency
                    of Miami University. He declined, declaring the school out of date, with a worn out system. The American added: "Let professors and teachers depend on public
                    patronage and labor to make the school meet the wants and wishes of the age in which we
                    live." Miami University was described as "overendowed". Miami had indeed
                    dropped low in attendance. The 1849-50 enrollment consisted of seven Seniors, eight Juniors,
                    thirteen Sophomores, sixteen Freshmen, thirty-six in Preparatory, and eleven in Partial Courses, a
                    total of 91. 
                        Hanover
                     College had 160 students; Asbury College at 
                        Greencastle
                    , 295.
            There were two rather common types of teachers, of whom John Robeson and Dr. Thomas were outstanding
                    examples. Robeson well represented the old 
                        South Carolina
                    -Indiana type. A versatile man was he, good at log rollings, barn raisings, fox and wolf
                    hunts and famous at dances and merrymakings. Few there were in a wide community who had never heard
                    his merry violin; few bullies for miles around who had never felt the weight of his hard-hitting
                    fists. In the school room, he was condescending to the small and puny but severe with the large and
                    rebellious. In great demand was John, so much so, that some districts preferred to wait for him,
                    permitting him to finish a three months' term elsewhere before their own started.
            Robeson was also an orator and politician. When the Civil War came and he failed to get a commission,
                    he volunteered as a private. As a child, the writer heard of the heroic exploits of John as hunter,
                    fighter and teacher. A Mr. Hahn, an old Civil War veteran who had served side by side with John for
                    years, when asked about John's heroism, hesitated a moment and then said: "He
                    could lick any man—any two men—in his company but when it came to the
                    enemy—well, he wasn't any more than any one of the rest of us."
            An example of the dorf type of teacher was Dr. Thomas. A student at some 
                        German
                     University, during the stormy forties,  an
                    ungrateful country kicked him out for his too loud demands for "gleichheit und
                    freiheit," that is, equality and liberty. Dr. Thomas was a physician, a minister, and also
                    a teacher. He brought his love of liberty with him to America and also his liking for beer. School
                    or church over for the day, he lined up at the village inn and held his own with the best of them.
                    He was eloquent, jovial, energetic, with something of the spirit of Carl Schurz. His regular term of
                    school over, he took subscription pupils, teaching English in the forenoon and 
                        German
                     in the afternoon. Pupils came for miles to attend his schools. Like great certain
                    teachers of today there was an element of uncertainty about his meting his classes—he
                    might be called away to a sick-bed, or to preach a funeral sermon, or, as sometimes happened, be
                    indisposed on account of too much "saus und braus" the night before.

            By GEORGE B. CATLIN
               ∗
            
            American penetration of the old Northwest began, systematically, in 1778, when Fort Pitt was the
                    western outpost. In that year, a fort was erected on a bluff at the junction of the
                    Ohio and Beaver rivers, twenty-eight miles northwest of 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , which was named Fort McIntosh in honor of General Lachlan McIntosh,1 who was born near Inverness, 
                        Scotland
                    , in 1725. In 1736 his father joined General Oglethorpe's expedition to 
                        Georgia
                    , with a company of about 100 Highlanders who settled on the Altamaha
                    River in what is now McIntosh County, 
                        Georgia
                    . In a collision with Spanish forces, McIntosh was taken prisoner, carried away to 
                        Spain
                     and returned after several years imprisonment.
            After reaching home, he secured employment with Henry Laurens of 
                        Charleston
                     and afterward took up surveying. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he raised a
                    regiment and was appointed a brigadier general. His success excited the jealously of Governor
                    Gwinett and after Gwinett's term as governor expired he challenged McIntosh to fight a
                    duel. Both were wounded and Gwinett soon died of his wound. General Washington engaged McIntosh to
                    undertake the defense of western 
                        Pennsylvania
                     against Indian attacks. In this he was successful. In 1778 McIntosh was to take part in
                    a general movement for the capture of 
                        Detroit
                     but was ordered to cooperate with Count d'Estaing in an attack upon Savannah
                    and never returned to 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . Fort McIntosh was named in recognition of his services and for a time it was the oniy
                    outpost west of 
                        Pittsburgh

            In 1779 George Rogers Clark captured 
                        Vincennes
                     and gave to Fort Sackville the name Patrick Henry. In 1788 settlements and forts were
                    built at 
                        Marietta
                     and at the site of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , the latter being named Fort 
                        Washington
                    . In the course of time a chain of small forts was established at intervals along the
                        Ohio River and up the Miami valley to 
                        Fort Wayne

            The conquest accomplished by General George Rogers Clark was not really a national but a provincial
                    enterprise, for in 1779 the colonies were still engaged in the struggle for independence. 
                        Vincennes
                     was captured by Virginians and it became a part of 
                        Virginia
                    's claim to the western territory. In 1784 
                        Virginia
                    , at the suggestion of Thomas Jefferson, ceded to the 
                        United States
                     her claim to land north of the Ohio River, reserving certain well
                    known tracts.
            During the period of the Revolution, officers and their commands were shifted about frequently, as
                    necessity required, from 
                        New England
                     and northern 
                        New York
                     to the southern colonies. Considering the general lack of roads and communications,
                    such movements seem almost incredible today. Because of this movement from north to south and from
                    the Ohio Valley to the seaboard the movements of troops are hard to follow.
            Among the minor officers of the Revolution was one obscure soldier, who served in many localities and
                    several different regiments. In spite of that and other handicaps, he earned distinction and
                    promotion, rising in time to the rank of Colonel in the First U.S. Infantry Regiment.2 That soldier was John Francis Hamtramck, a native of Quebec, whose infancy and youth
                    were spent under the flag of Great Britain. His father, Charles David Hamtramck, was a native of the
                    Duchy of Luxemburg who settled in Quebec in 1754, conducted a barber shop, made wigs, and married
                    Marie Anne Bertin, a French girl of the town. On August 16, 1756, Jean Francois Hamtramck was
                        born.3 His name was afterwards anglicised, becoming John Francis. His mother
                    was never reconciled to the British conquest of 
                        Canada
                    , and it is supposed that she instilled into the boy a prejudice against the conquering
                    British. John Francis must have gone to 
                        New York
                     almost as soon as the American colonies began to revolt because he became a captain in
                    the Fifth 
                        New York
                     Regiment on November 21, 1776.4

                            of the birth of John Francis Hamtramck, which agrees with the data on the marble slab placed
                            above his grave. August 16, 1766, has been the more generally accepted date.

                     is said to have been but five feet five inches in
                    height—he must have shown unusual ability to attract attention and win promotion. In 1786
                    he became a major in the First 
                        United States
                     Infantry Regiment and in 1793 he was Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of General Anthony
                    Wayne's First Sub-Legion.5
            
            Just when he was shifted to Western Pennsylvania is not known, but he was stationed at Fort Pitt by
                    the year 1786. In July, Colonel Josiah Harmar sent him with three companies to protect a party of
                    surveyors who were working near the Little Beaver River in the Mingo Bottom. He
                    was also ordered to destroy the dwellings of intruders on the public lands.6 In
                    both tasks he was successful. He destroyed twelve cabins of "these fellows who wish to live
                    under no government…."7 It was at this time that Fort 
                        Steuben
                     was built. Major Hamtramck completed it in 1787 and was its first commanding
                        officer.8 As so often happened in the Northwest during this period, his
                    soldiers were "barefoot and miserably off for clothing, particularly woolen
                    overalls" in the month of November.9
            
            By June 7, 1787, Hamtramck was ready to start on a new venture. He accompanied Harmar to 
                        Vincennes
                    , starting from Fort Harmar and stopping for a few weeks at the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    .10 About one hundred and eighty miles below the Rapids, Major
                    Hamtramck, with a party of one hundred men, was detached to conduct the fleet "to the mouth
                    of the 
                        Wabash
                    , and then to ascend the river for Post 
                        Vincennes
                    ." Meanwhile Harmar with the remainder of the troops and the cattle marched
                    overland. When he arrived he found "the Wabash River so low and
                    difficult to ascend, [that] I detached a sergeant and twenty men, in three barges and five
                    pettiaugers, to meet Major Hamtramck and lighten the fleet." Hamtramck, however,
                    "did not arrive with the boats until the 25th [of July], having been eleven days on a very
                    severe, fatiguing duty, ascending the 
                        Wabash
                    . He was obliged to leave Ensign

                    and chief part of the flour at the mouth of the Wa-bash, the water being so shoal that the boats
                    could not ascend the river."11
            
            When Harmar returned to Fort Harmar on October 1, 1787, he left Major Hamtramck with ninety-five men
                    in command at Post 
                        Vincennes
                    , with orders to "fortify himself, and to regulate the militia, who are to join
                    him in case of hostilities."12 Accordingly he built a fort and, as
                    Harmar directed, named it Fort 
                        Knox
                    .13
            
            The new Commandant faced many problems, which he solved as well as his ability and the circumstances
                    would permit. When his service was finished, the people of 
                        Vincennes
                     felt that his achievement was praise-worthy.14 On the third day of
                    his command he issued a proclamation prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors to the Indians.15 The absence of civil government both in 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Kaskaskia
                     was the origin of many of his problems. The court was abused to such an extent that he
                    finally dissolved it in April, 1788, and ordered new magistrates to be elected, establishing a few
                    regulations for them to go by. "My code of laws," he told Harmar, "will,
                    no doubt, make you laugh, but I hope you will consider that I am neither a lawyer or a
                    legislator." When the terms of these officials ended the following April, he advised the
                    people to wait until the Governor arrived.16 Soon, however, he was receiving
                    requests from the people for regulations against those persons, found very frequently on the
                    frontier, who are too prone to take advantage of others. As a result, on May 10, 1789, he issued a
                    proclamation that "…. all persons are expressly prohibited (under the penalty of
                    a fine for the first trespess and imprisonment for the second) from cultivating any lot or piece of
                    ground on the commons, or occupying any part thereof, without regular permission."17
            
            The summer passed and still the Governor had not come. Hamtramck sent the following warning to Harmar
                    in August:

                        If his Excellency does not come this year or some of the Judges, most of the people will go
                            away to the Spaniards, for they begin to think that there are no such men as a Governor or
                                Judges.18
                  
                    
                
            The Spaniards from across the Mississippi River had been sending alluring
                    promises to 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Kaskaskia
                    . The previous October, Hamtramck had intercepted a message from the Commandant at 
                        St. Louis
                     promising the people of 
                        Vincennes
                     free lands on the Spanish side of the river.19 Helpless to prevent
                    it, he saw daily many persons going across to the Spanish. He wrote to Harmar: 
                        I believe that all our Americans of Post 
                                Vincennes
                             will go to Morgan—a number of them have already gone to see him. I
                            am told that Mr. Morgan has taken unwarrantable measures to invite the people of the 
                                Illinois
                             to come to him, saying that the Governor would never come in that country,
                            & that their negroes were all free the moment the government should be
                            established—for which all the remaining good inhabitants propose to go to him.20
                  
                    
                
            With September came a plea from the citizens of 
                        Kaskaskia
                     for at least twenty soldiers and an officer to keep order there and perhaps decrease
                    the depredations of the Indians and stop the migration across the 
                        Mississippi
                    . Hamtramck's force, originally small, was rendered ineffective by illness so
                    that he did not have enough well men to defend 
                        Vincennes
                     and, of course, could spare none to 
                        Kaskaskia
                    . He could only send their request to Headquarters.21
            
            At last, on November 11, 1789, he sent a letter to Harmar that was something more than a request:
                        
                        It is high time that Government should take place in this country & if it should
                            happen that the Governor was not to come, nor any of the Judges, I would beg (for the sake
                            of the people) that his Excellency would give me certain powers to create Magistrates, a
                            sheriff & other officers, for the purpose of establishing courts of
                            Justice—…. Those that had been appointed by the people last year,
                            their authority has been refused in the courts of 
                                Kentucky
                            , they declaring that by the resolve of Congress, neither the people of Post 
                                Vincennes
                            , or the Commanding Officer, had a right to appoint magistrates;.

                        … You see, Sir, … how necessary it is that some steps should be taken
                            to relieve them.22
                  
                    
                
            Another phase of his difficulties due to lack of authority and government is set forth in his
                    proclamation of March 24, 1790.
            
                    Many persons having sold their goods and lands, to the prejudice of their creditors, the
                        inhabitants and others of the district of Post 
                            Vincennes
                        , are expressly prohibited, henceforth, from selling, or exchanging, or mortgaging,
                        any part of their goods, lands, or slaves, under any pretext, without express permission from
                        the officer commanding at this place. This ordinance to remain in force until the arrival of his
                        Excellency, the Governor.23
               
                
            Major Hamtramck also had to deal with the Indian question. Having captured a Piankeshaw Chief who had
                    killed a white man and boy, he imprisoned him because he thought that he could achieve greater
                    results in this manner than by exacting vengeance. For this decision he gave the reason 
                        that the first Chief of that nation is a man of reason & good Indian, to whom I can
                            represent the conduct of some of his chiefs & demand of him satisfaction for the
                            blood of those people that this prisoner has murdered: & will give so much solemnity
                            to the affair as to make the nation believe that his pardon will be the last act of lenity
                            of the 
                                United States
                            , if they do not change their conduct. Another season was, that I had nothing to
                            fear from their resentment, for they are very inconsiderable in numbers, & I am sure
                            the whole nation will be with me in a few days crying for mercy—but after all I
                            wish I could hang the rascal.24
                  
                    
                
            With spring, the Indian depredations increased until he finally asked for extra provisions in order
                    that the fort might be prepared for the worst although the rumored attack might not materialize.25 The rumors and the frequent reports of the murder of isolated settlers must
                    have given him some uneasy moments, especially when forty-nine of his little garrison were ill with
                    the ague and there was no medicine and no food except the salt provisions.26
                    Then came a party of Kentuckians, two hundred twenty of them, who made a raid upon the

                     Indians, killing twelve. Hamtramck had more reason than ever to
                    fear an attack, for such an expedition could be no more than a "provocation".27 However, his efforts for peace received a slight reward when eighty Wea
                    warriors put themselves under the protection of the 
                        United States
                    .28 His knowledge of French as well as English enabled him to win
                    the good will of the French of 
                        Vincennes
                     and to use them in his negotiations with the Indians who were intensely prejudiced
                    against the Americans. The threat of a Vermilion Indian caused his first messenger to turn back. But
                    in April, 1790, he sent Antoine Gamelin up the 
                        Wabash
                     to carry Governor St. Clair's message of peace to the Indians. The mission was
                    not successful. Hamtramck's report of May 22, 1790 was adverse; he thought it scarcely
                    possible to make peace.29
            
            Having failed when he extended the olive branch, St. Clair then tried the sword. Three hundred 
                        Virginia
                     militia, together with the garrison of Fort 
                        Steuben
                     were ordered to 
                        Vincennes
                     whence they were to advance up the 
                        Wabash
                     attacking such villages as they could. At the same time, Harmar, with a force of more
                    than twelve hundred was to cross the country to the Miami Villages and destroy them.30 Harmar burned the villages, but lost the skirmishes. Hamtramck accomplished very
                    little, due largely to the lack of promised supplies. Major 
                        Whitley
                    , of the militia, had arrived at Fort 
                        Knox
                     with only twenty of the ninety-six oxen with which he started at the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    .31
            
            In December, 1790, Hamtramck wrote to General St. Clair expressing the opinion that the territory
                    could never be held in peace by the Americans until the northern posts, including 
                        Detroit
                    , could be taken from the British, so that they would no longer be rallying points and
                    supply bases for hostile Indians. In view of St. Clair's unfortunate experience not quite a
                    year later, the entire letter may well be given here:

                                     have requested it of me in your letter of
                                    January 23, 1790, and if I have not communicated my sentiments before, it was from
                                    an apprehension that they might be contrary to the general opinion of Indian
                                    affairs. They are now presented to your Excellency with full expectation that it
                                    will not be ascribed to arrogance or ostentation on my part, it being the result of
                                    the purest intention. On those calculated expectations I will speak freely, and give
                                    as my opinion that nothing can establish a peace with the Indians as long as the
                                    British keep possession of the upper forts; for they certainly are daily sowing the
                                    seed of discord betwixt the measures of our Government and the Indians.
                        Perhaps the Indians will call for a peace early this spring. if so, I can assure you
                                    that I am not mistaken if I prognosticate that it will be done to deceive us, and
                                    ought not to be granted before we have another expedition, and have established
                                    respectable garrisons in the most important parts of their country; then will we be
                                    able to make peace on our conditions, and not on theirs.
                        The Indians never can be subdued by just going into their towns and burning their
                                    houses and corn, and returning the next day, for it is no hardship to an Indian to
                                    live without; they make themselves perfectly comfortable on meat alone; and as for
                                    houses, they can build them with as much facility as a bird does his nest.
                        As for obtaining any advantage of them in action, there is, in my opinion, very
                                    little to be calculated on that head; for they will not fight without having a
                                    decided advantage over their enemies, and if they find they can not meet them, they
                                    always have a sufficient country, which affords them a secured situation.
                        Should Government be disposed to carry on an expedition in the spring without
                                    establishing garrisons in their country, I would then beg permission to suggest an
                                    idea, which can be done by having all the men mounted on good horses, and every man
                                    to be his own commissary; that is, he should furnish himself with provisions for so
                                    many days; by that means a large body of troops would be able to perform (with
                                    probability) such an expedition undiscovered, and with very great dispatch. This
                                    plan appears to me to be the most eligible one that can be adopted; for if the 
                                        United States
                                     want to chastise the Indians, there is no other way to do it with
                                    success than by surprising them in their town or camp. Another observation which I
                                    beg to make, that, admitting a treaty should take place this spring, the people of
                                    our frontier will certainly be the first to break it. The people of 
                                        Kentucky
                                     will carry on private expeditions against the Indians and kill them
                                    whenever they meet them, and I do not believe that there is a jury in all 
                                        Kentucky
                                     who would punish a man for it. These combined circumstances, sir, make
                                    me think that, until we are securely intrenched in the Indian country, we never can
                                    be sure that peace is fully established; for as the thirst of war is the dearest
                                    inheritance an Indian receives from his parents, and vengeance that of the
                                    Kentuckians, hostility must then be the result on both sides.32
                        
                     
                  
               
                
            
               
                  32 In ibid. II, 197-98. In his letter of Jan. 23, 1790,
                        St. Clair had said: "From the length of time you have been in the 
                            Wabash
                         country, your thouahts must have bren sometimes turned to that object [chastising
                        the Indians], and to rcceive any observations you might think proper to communicate would be
                        esteemed a favor." See ibid., II. 130-31.
            
            
            General St. Clair, himself, the following autumn, decided to undertake the chastisement of the
                    Indians. Among others, Major Hamtramck, still stationed at Fort 
                        Knox
                    , was ordered to Fort 
                        Washington
                    .33 Soon after his arrival, he with three hundred men was ordered to
                    follow the surveyors and to open a road to the Miami from Fort 
                        Washington
                     so that the artillery could be transported.34 The story of St.
                    Clair's complete defeat on the site of the later Fort Recovery need not be repeated here.
                    Major Hamtramck and the First Regiment were not participants in the battle, if such it may be
                    called.
            On the morning of October 31, 1791, three days before the army met the Indians, about sixty 
                        Kentucky
                     militia deserted in a body. St. Clair feared that they would seize the provision train
                    which he supposed to be within twenty miles. His men had already been on half allowance of flour
                    with the difference made up in beef for two or three days so that he could not well afford to lose
                    the expected supplies. Accordingly, Major Hamtramck and the First Regiment, consisting of about
                    three hundred effective men, were sent back to protect the convoys. He was told to send a guard back
                    with the first section of the provision train and then to proceed about twenty-five miles below Fort
                    Jefferson, or until he met the second section, and then to rejoin the army.35
            
            When the attack occurred on October 3, Hamtramck was thirty miles away on his way back to the army.
                    He had not seen the second convoy. Hearing the cannon, he hastened forward. When the regiment had
                    gone about nine miles, they were told by some fleeing militia that the army was totally destroyed.
                    Hamtramck decided that he should do all he could to save the fort if such were the case.
                    Consequently, he sent a subaltern to get more definite information from St. Clair, and he and his
                    men marched back eight miles to Fort Jefferson. He looked to the defenses as best he could and in
                    the evening was preparing to march to meet the retreating army when St. Clair and his sorry band
                    arrived.
            Since the First Regiment had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours and there were no provisions at the
                    Fort, it was

                     decided to move toward Fort 
                        Hamilton
                    . At ten that same night Hamtramck's hungry men and St. Clair's weary
                    army left their wounded behind and marched, without stopping until an hour before daylight. After a
                    brief rest they were again on the march at nine o'clock in the morning. They must have
                    taken new courage when the long expected provisions came in sight. The contractor had failed to get
                    the division started in time. At the first water, they halted and ate for the first time since the
                    night of October 2. At one o'clock the march was begun again. St. Clair's army
                    returned to Fort 
                        Washington
                    .36
            
            Upon his arrival there, Major Hamtramck was arrested by Colonel William Darke. He was accused of
                    "cowardice and shamefully retreating for fear of the enemy", because of his
                    decision to save Fort Jefferson on the day of the battle. Governor St. Clair wanted to send
                    Hamtramck to confer with the 
                        Wabash
                     Indians. Darke, however, had gone and would not be back for some time. It was irregular
                    to try a man when the prosecutor was absent, but St. Clair decided that the circumstances were too
                    pressing for technicalities. Hamtramck was tried and honorably acquitted.37
            
            Hamtramck reached Fort 
                        Knox
                     on December 21, 1791, and immediately held a conference with the Indian chiefs there.
                    The Indians declared their intention to make peace with the 
                        United States
                    . In return they were given a hunting preserve extending from 
                        Terre Haute
                     to the mouth of the 
                        Wabash
                    . Some French and friendly Indians were next despatched as confidential agents to
                    various Indian tribes of the vicinity. Their overtures of friendship met a favorable response from
                    both the Wea and Eel River Indians.38
            
            When Wayne was organizing his Legion of the 
                        United States
                     in September, 1792, Hamtramck became a Major in the First Sub Legion and a year later
                    was promoted to the office of Lieutenant Colonel Commandant.39 In the Legion
                    were a number of notable soldiers who made history and achieved some measure of fame. There was

                    Commandant at 
                        Detroit
                    , and Lieutenant John Whistler, who built the first Fort 
                        Dearborn
                     on the Chicago River.40 In fact the Legion
                    included one of the most remarkable groups of American officers ever brought together in one body.
            During a part, at least, of 
                        Wayne
                    's march northward from Fort 
                        Washington
                    , Lieutenant Colonel Hamtramck was detailed to guard the provision train. This was a
                    responsible position for the success of the expedition rested largely upon that long line of wagons
                    and pack-horses. It was also a post fraught with danger for the Indians did attack another convoy
                    and captured seventy horses.41 At the Battle of The Fallen Timbers, Colonel
                    Hamtramck commanded the left wing of 
                        Wayne
                    's attacking force. In his official report of the battle, General Wayne made
                    special mention of certain officers, among them "Brigadier General [James] Wilkinson, and
                    Colonel Hamtramck, the commandants of the right and left wings of the legion, whose brave example
                    inspired the troops." Lieutenant William Henry Harrison, an Aid-de-Camp, was also
                        cornmended.42
            
            After the battle the army marched through fertile and well-timbered land to the junction of the
                        St. Joseph and St. Mary's rivers. Here they
                    found a large area of cleared land, nearly five hundred acres in extent. On a spot overlooking

                     the three rivers, 
                        Wayne
                     determined to build a fort.43 This was a strategic point, the head
                    of a portage to the upper reaches of the 
                        Wabash
                    . The men, organized into squads, were soon busy with ax and spade. The air was filled
                    with the sound of the blows of the axes and of the falling trees. An Indian brave created a little
                    excitement the first day. One of the privates describes the incident: 
                        It was on the morning of the first day we were at work felling the timber. A squad near where
                            I was at work were engaged in felling a very large and very tall oak standing near the outer
                            edge of the opening, which had been cut nearly through and tottering in mid-air, when a
                            voice was heard overhead which somewhat startled the men at first; but on looking up, they
                            beheld a ‘red varmint’ perched in the topmost branches. This fellow,
                            no doubt, after finding he was caught, had made up his mind that it was death anyway, and
                            concluded to take his chances and go with the tree. But as it began to tremble and shake, he
                            got shaky himself, and, like Captain Scott's 'coon, had to come down and
                            that in a hurry. The boys, as they watched him scramble down, ached to get a shot at him,
                            but they dared not. He was a large, fine-looking Indian. In the belt around his naked waist
                            was a knife and a tomahawk. He appeared perfectly undaunted; in fact, assumed an air of
                            defiance, and when marched off to headquarters, seemed well pleased that he had escaped
                            being killed by the falling tree or the bullets of the soldiers. He was evidently a spy and
                            had climbed to the top of the tree to see what was going on in camp, little dreaming that
                            his adventure would result as it did. When the tree fell, a buckskin pouch was found filled
                            with parched corn and jerked venison. He was held a prisoner for some weeks, and one morning
                            it was announced that he was non est. How he escaped was a mystery that
                            was never solved.44
                  
                    The work was finished. Lieutenant Colonel Hamtramck, now in command, ordered the firing of
                    fifteen rounds of cannon and formally took possession of the new fort which he named 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in honor of his chief.45 This original fort was replaced by another
                    and that one by the city of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , which has spread out over historic ground.

                        United States
                     soldiers and of militia. After St. Clair's defeat some difficulty was
                    experienced in securing enlistments for 
                        Wayne

                     sent west to be converted into soldiers under the strict
                    discipline of 
                        Wayne
                     and Hamtramck. The latter was a strict disciplinarian and one of the best drill-masters
                    in the American army. The leopards did not change their spots and the thieves continued their
                    depredations in camp, raiding the stores of food and whisky at night and stealing from officers and
                    men alike. They killed cattle, sheep, and pigs of the French settlers, raided the houses of such
                    settlers and were the cause of constant trouble. Several who were detected in such crimes were given
                    one hundred lashes, which was the limit allowed by army regulations. One was hanged and another shot
                    to death. The garrison of the new fort gave Hamtramck much trouble. The thieving and marauding
                    continued. At last in his letters to General Wayne, Hamtramck suggested that he be given a wider
                    discretion and authority which would enable him to hang enough of the malefactors to compel them to
                    respect military orders and regulations. "I have flogged them till I am tired," he
                    wrote. "The economical allowance of one hundred lashes, allowed by the government, does not
                    appear a sufficient inducement for a rascal to act the part of an honest man." In a later
                    letter, he said, 
                        I had very great hopes that the man who deserted when on his post would have been made an
                            example of; but weakness too often appears in the shape of lenity, for he was only sentenced
                            to receive one hundred lashes, to be branded, and drummed out. This man from his past
                            conduct, was perfectly entitled to the gallows.46
                  
                    
                
            Desertions must have been fairly frequent. When two deserters were brought back by an interpreter and
                    an Indian who had been sent after them, he wished "they had brought their scalps, for I
                    know not what to do with them. Could I have the power, at all times, to call a general court martial
                    for the trial of deserters it would save a great deal of time."47
            
            Perhaps the men deserve some sympathy for living conditions were harsh during that winter of
                    1794-1795. A member of the garrison has left the following account: 
                        During that winter, 1794-5, we lived very poorly. Our beef came to us on the hoof, and poor,
                            and we had little or nothing to fatten them with. Having no salt to cure it, it was
                            slaughtered and hung up under a shed, where by exposure it became perfectly weatherbeaten,
                            and as 
                        
                           46

                             tough as an old hide. Of course it made a miserable
                            soup. At the same time our men received but half rations of flour, and were working like
                            beavers, to complete our quarters. Thus we lived until about the middle of February, when a
                            brigade of packhorses arrived loaded with flour and salt, and with them came a drove of
                            hogs. From this time forward, we considered ourselves as living on the ‘fat of
                            the land.’ An early spring followed, and with it came ducks, geese, and trout, to
                            improve our living; and the Indians, soon after, came in with their flags to sue for peace;
                            and our time passed away pleasantly.48
                  
                    
                
            Hamtramck carried on negotiations with the Indians. However, the futility of his efforts led him to
                    suggest an indirect method. The French traders seemed to him to be "so many machines to the
                    British agents". Why not bribe them (he thought this entirely possible) and thus deprive
                    the British agent of his "satellites" and leave him "to make penance for
                    his past iniquities".49
            
            During the second winter, 1795-96, about ninetey Indians, children, old women, and a few very old
                    men, depended upon the garrison for food. In January Hamtramck's diminishing supplies
                    forced him to tell them that they could get no more food from the fort. "But,
                    sir," he wrote to General Wayne, "if other supplies could be got by land, I
                    consider it politic to feed these poor creatures, who will suffer very much for want of
                    subsistence." In spite of his decision to give them no more, he found it impossible to turn
                    them away when they asked for food. He could not refuse them and see them die.50
            
            From 
                        Fort Wayne
                     he went to Fort Miamis in 1796, and on July 11th of the same year he left there to go
                    to 
                        Detroit
                    . An advance guard under Captain Moses Porter took possession of 
                        Detroit
                     on that day, and Hamtramck arrived two days later.51 The people of 
                        Detroit
                     and of the nearby settlements were almost exclusively Canadian French52 so the new Commandant, himself Canadian born, was admirably suited to his new
                    responsibilities. He continued in this position until his death on April 11, 1803.
            The passing of this man who had served the 
                        United States
                     continuously for twenty-six years, called forth sincere tributes from his fellow
                    officers and superiors. Captain

                     Thomas Pasteur, then in charge of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , said that his "virtues as a man, and military Abilities as an officer cannot
                    be read or Doubted." He issued orders for the proper observance of the occasion, as
                    follows: 
                        In memory of his name & worth, do order that on the Morning of the Insuing Day (the
                            1st May) that Minut Guns be fired from six until seven OClock, That the Garrison Flag be
                            hoisted half mast each day for one week, & requests the officers of the Garrison to

            Henry Dearborn, Secretary of War, regretted "the loss of such an experienced and valuable
                        officer."54 The officers who served under Hamtramck made up a purse
                    to erect a monument above his grave. Upon a marble tablet they had inscribed the tribute quoted
                    here: 
                        True patriotism And a zealous attachment to national liberty Joined to a laudable ambition,
                            Led him into military service at a early Period of his life. He was a soldier even before he
                            was a man. He was an active participant In all the dangers, difficulties and honors Of the
                            Revolutionary war, And his heroism and uniform good conduct Procured him the attention and
                            personal Thanks of The immortal

                            and pleasant member. To his family his loss is incalulable, And his friends never forget The
                            memory of Hamtramck. This humble monument is placed over His remains By the officers who had
                            the honor To serve under his command—A small but grateful tribute to His merit
                            and His worth.55
                  
                    John Francis Hamtramck must have been a man of rare qualities to win such a voluntary
                    tribute as that from army officers whose pay was scarcely sufficient for their own support. A

            He left no will, so William Henry Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory, was appointed an
                    administrator of the estate, as well as guardian of two daughters, Julian and Harriet.56 The other administrators were the widow, Rebecca Hamtramck, James Henry and John Rice

                     valuation of his personal property was $2,137.47. He
                    had evidently engaged in farming, for among the items of his property appear twenty-two sheep and
                    ten lambs, two cows and a calf, one horse, and a plow and ox cart. His library shows, perhaps, his
                    preferences in books. Among them were two editions of Cireco, two histories, one of 
                        Scotland
                     and one of America, a French Bible, a French and Latin Dictionary, a life of Frederick
                    the Great, and a work on military tactics.57
            
            He also left a farm of about 80 arpens on the Detroit River
               58 and 272.32 [arpens] in the lower prairie near 
                        Vincennes
                    . Probably he also still owned a lot 33 x 34 feet in 
                        Vincennes
                     which he had had surveyed in 1790.59 At one time he had been given
                    land where 
                  Mt. Vernon, Ohio
               , now stands,60 and had received
                    ample compensation from both 
                        New York

                        United States
                     for leaving 
                        Canada
                     and joining the Revolutionary forces.61
            
            Colonel Hamtramck's grave and monument have been twice moved. He was first buried in Old
                    Saint Anne's church yard at Griswold and Jefferson Avenue, 
                        Detroit
                    ; second in the later church yard at Larned and 
                        Randolph
                     Streets; and finally in Mount Elliott cemetary in the same city.62
                    During a period of a century and a quarter since his burial the inscription on the huge marble slab,
                    set on short pillars over his grave, became so weather-worn that it was illegible. On Memorial Day,
                    1929, the Catholic Woman's Clubs of 
                        Detroit
                     had a replica made in granite, which was laid on top of the original slab and dedicated
                    with appropriate ceremonies before a large gathering of the citizens of

            RECORDS RELATING TO THE OLD UNION CHURCH OF NORTH TERRE HAUTE
            Edited by ALBERT A. ORTH
            
            
                    Introduction
                
            Travelers along what is now known as 
                        United States
                     Road 41, but better remembered by the older residents of the community as the 
                        LaFayette
                     Roard, have doubtless noticed the old church building which stands on the west side of
                    the road about one-half mile north of North 
                        Terre Haute
                    . Although not quite as old as the historic Markle's Mill, on Otter Creek, at
                    the east edge of North 
                        Terre Haute
                    , the church building is now about ninety years old. It has the distinction of being the
                    first in Otter Creek Township, and probably one of the first churches in the northern section of 
                        Vigo County
                    .
            Some of the same persons whose names figure in other early activities of 
                        Vigo County
                     appearing in the records of this church. Frederick Markle and David Lyons, among
                    others, are prominent in this work. At the time the first meeting was held which eventually resulted
                    in the building of the Union Church, 
                        Vigo County
                     was only a little more than twenty years of age. The assemblage at which the subject of
                    a union meeting house was first broached was held at the Union Schoolhouse in Otter Creek Township
                    on July 7, 1838. Alban C. Davis and David Lyons were evidently the leaders in the movement since the
                    latter became the president of the meeting and the former the secretary. The second meeting was held
                    on July 21 of the same year. At this time definite mention was made of the fact that the church was
                    to be free for all denominations of Christians and that it should ever remain so.
            No other documentary material is available for the remaining months of 1838, but a notice of election
                    and a certificate of election indicate the first activities of 1839. At this election Isaac M.
                    Dawson, Alban C. Davis, Frederick Markle, and Marvin M. Hickcox were chosen trustees. On the 29th of
                         July, 1839, a deed for the land on which the church now
                    stands was given to the trustees by William and Elizabeth Ann Stevens, husband and wife. The
                    trustees received the property as the representatives of the Union Religious Society of Otter Creek
                    which was the name adopted by the organization fostering the movement. The only qualification was
                    that the property must be used for church purposes.
            The subscription list bears no date but it can be assumed that solicitation for the expense of
                    building the church began soon after the property came into the hands of the Society. The larger
                    number of the approximately seventy persons who pledged money paid in full. Some, however, are
                    marked as not paid, and others seem to have paid only after a judgment was secured against them. A
                    few paid only parts of their subscriptions. The smallest amount pledged was two dollars and the
                    largest one hundred dollars. The average amount was about five dollars although there were several
                    donations of ten and twenty dollars each. These pioneers must have felt the need of a church else
                    they would not have made such pledges in a period when such amounts of money loomed large. Of the
                    $707.50 which was pledged for the construction of the building, $525.50 was
                    finally paid. Frederick Markle and A.M. Pettengill collected the greater part of the building fund,
                    the former obtaining $157.50 and the latter $368.
            Evidence as to the exact date of the completion of the church is lacking. However, in January, 1842,
                    rules were adopted by the trustees for the use of the building. Originally the building was in the
                    form of a rectangle with one large room. The outside has a series of bas-relief pillars. A small
                    rostrum or pulpit was placed in the original building, this being later enlarged into a rostrum
                    extecding across the entire front or west end of the building. The original seats were crude benches
                    which were later replaced with chairs.
            Old Union Church was used for many years as a place for the holding of interdenominational chweh and
                    Sunday school services. The Rose Hill Methodist Episcopal Church, now located
                    in its own building near Otter Creek Junction in the center of the township came into existence at
                    Old Union. The present Methodist congregation of North 
                        Terre Haute
                     whose place of worship is known as the Park Avenue Church, also had its beginnings
                    here. The North 
                        Terre Haute
                     Christian  (Disciples) Church was another
                    congregation which organized in the historic Union building. In addition to these, many series of
                    revival meetings and various attempts to introduce new denominations into the community have been
                    made at Old Union.
            By 1910 the Church was no longer in regular use by any church organization or other society. No one
                    had any responsibility for the care of it. As a consequence, the building was rapidly falling into
                    decay and ruin. The "Inasmuch Circle" of "The King's Daughters
                    and Sons," which had been organized in the church and which had always taken an interest in
                    it was considered by some persons in the community as the logical organization to assume the
                    responsibility for preserving the building. This organization is of an inter-denominational, though
                    religious character, a unit of an international organization. It most nearly corresponded in spirit
                    to the Union Religious Society which built the church.
            Mr. Fred Beal, at the time the judge of the Vigo Superior Court, became interested in the matter. He
                    effected a temporary reorganization of the Union Religious Society, which organization then deeded
                    the property to the Inasmuch Circle. This transaction took place in 1914 and since that time the
                    Circle has kept the church in good repair. Recently, it has been remodeled so as to provide a first
                    unit of a Home for Aged Couples. However, an auditorium has been provided in the remodeled structure
                    which is still used as a community meeting place. Eventually, it is hoped to arrange a small
                    historical museum in the building where objects of interest in the history of the township may be
                    preserved. The exterior of the building remains practically unchanged.
            The documents which follow were turned over to the mother of the writer who is a member of the
                    Inasmuch Circle by Mrs. Anna Markle, wife of one of the descendants of Frederick Markle, a leader in
                    the Union Religious Society. The papers are in a good state of preservation and legible. As can be
                    noted from the documents themselves rules of capitalization, spelling, and punctuation were not
                    closely followed by the writers. Neverthless, the sense is plain in most cases. These papers will be
                    preservcd in the historical museum which it is planned to place in the Old Union Church at as early
                    a time as possible.

            [Resolutions of the Trustees of the Union Meeting House.]
            
                    At a meeting held at the house of F Markle on the 10 day of January 1842 by the Trustees of the
                        Union Meeting house of Otter Creek the following resolutions were adopted22
               
                    2 Resolved that Saml C Rowley take charge of the key of Said house and receive the appointments
                        of preachers and to sweep the house once in two weeks and to receive a salary of —23 month for his services
                    3 Resolved that all appointments for preaching shall be made in writing and left in the pulpit in
                        a place prepared for that purpose and the oldest appointment shall also have the preference. In
                        case of a quarterly or protracted meeting being appointed it shall be stated in this appointment
                        how long the meeting will be held and there shall be no continuance of the meeting to interfere
                        with other appointments
                    4 Resolved that appointments made for all meeting except protracted or quarterly shall be at as
                        early an hour as eleven OClock A M and if in the after noon to be as late as two Oclock
                    5 Resolved that in case of two appointments interfering with each other it shall be the person
                        having charge of the key to inform the person making the last appointment of the same and also to inform notify…….24
               
                    6th Resolved that Thomas Briggs be appointed to Call on Alben [Alban] C Davis for the
                        subscriptions and and money that may be in his hands and report to his Co Trustees as Early as
                        possible.
                    
                  
                     22 The date has apparently been added later, as it is in a different
                            color of ink and style of handwriting. The first resolution is numbered
                            "2".
                  
                     23 The amount of salary was left blank in the original resolutions.
                  
                     24 Italicized words and omitted words are crossed out. The ommitted
                            words are illegible.
               
                    
                    7th Resolved that Alban C Davis be furnished with a Coppy of the above resolutions as soon as
                        Convenient
                    8th Motion of M M Hickcox it was Resolved that I M Dawson be appointed of Chairman of the Committee
                  25 and Frederick Markle be
                            appointed
                  26 Clerk Resolved that it is hereby made the duty of the
                        Clerk of this bord to advertise ten days previous to the second Saturdays of January 1843 for an
                        Election for trustees 10 Resolved that no one Trustee shall be permitted to receive the key of
                        the Union meeting without
                  27 at the absence of his Co
                        Trustees 10th Resolved that the different religious denominations be requested to use their
                        influence in obtaining donations to relieve the trustees from their liabilities to said house
                        and that I M Dawson be appointed to make said request28
               
                    [Signatures]29
               
                
            
               
                  25 Italicized words crossed out.
               
                  26 Italicized words crossed out.
               
                  27 The italicized word is crossed out.
               
                  28 These resolutions are written on the two inner pages of a folded sheet
                        of paper, the pages being twelve by eight inches in size.
               
                  29 What appears to be the initials of those present at the meeting are
                        written beneath the last resolution. They are practically illegible.
            
         
         
         
            Comment and News
            Benjamin Franklin, a wise man of his day and generation, included the following in a draft for a
                    constitution which he submitted to the Second Continental Congress on July 21, 1775: 
                        As all new Institutions may have imperfections which only Time and Experience can discover,
                            it is agreed, that the General Congress from time to time shall propose such Amendments of
                            this Constitution as may be found necessary; which being approv'd by a Majority of
                            the Colony Assemblies shall be equally binding with the rest of the Articles of this
                            Confederation.
                    
                
            This very simple method of changing the fundamental law was not embodied in the Articles of
                    Confederation nor in the Constitution framed in 1787. Members of State constitutional conventions,
                    if we may judge by amending clauses in State constitutions, have usually believed that political
                    wisdom would die with them. No part of a constitution can be a greater barrier to orderly progress
                    than a rigid and unworkable amending provision. The general assumption has been that constitutions
                    would undergo constant modifications should the amending process be made easy. The fundamental truth
                    is that the danger lies in the opposite direction. Even with a liberal amending clause, essential
                    changes would in most instances be delayed too long. The members of the Indiana Constitutional
                    Convention of 1850-1851 reached the climax of conservatism when framing the amending clause. The
                    provision then agreed on, which makes an eloquent though mute plea for a new constitutional
                    convention reads: 
                        Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in either branch of the
                            General Assembly; and if the same be agreed to by a majority of the members elected to each
                            of the two Houses, such proposed amendment or amendments shall, with the years and nays
                            thereon be entered on their journals and referred to the General Assembly to be chosen at
                            the next general election; and, if in the General Assembly so next chosen, such proposed
                            amendment or amendments shall be agreed to by a majority of all the members elected to each
                            house, then it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to submit such amendment or
                            amendments to the electors of the State and if a majority of said  electors shall ratify the same, such amendment or amendments
                            shall become a part of this Constitution.
                    
                
            A very timely book, Constitution Making in Indiana, III, by Charles Kettleborough,
                    Director of the Indiana Legislative Bureau, was recently brought out by the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau. This volume, which follows two others published in 1916, covers the efforts that have been
                    made by citizens of Indiana since that date to replace the present Constitution (framed near the end
                    of the stage-coach era) with a new one. A review of Dr. Kettleborough's welcome
                    contribution will appear in our December issue.
            Mr. Eugene Gano Hay of Summit, 
                        New Jersey
                    , is a native Hoosier who spent his youth and early manhood in Indiana. For many years
                    he has practiced law in 
                        New York City
                    . His letter of July 28, 1930, which is here printed in full will no doubt interest many
                    readers: 
                  
                     
                        The article by Miss Knox which was published in the December, 1929, issue of the Indiana Magazine of History, awakened in my memory thoughts of the
                                    dear little City of 
                                        Vevay
                                     that have slept for almost 50 years, during my residences and
                                    wanderings over various parts of the world. About fifty years ago, when I had
                                    practised law at 
                                        Madison
                                    , Indiana for but two years, the trusting and confiding people of the
                                    Judiciary Circuit, composed of Jefferson and 
                                        Switzerland Counties
                                    , took a desperate chance in electing me Prosecuting Attorney. As I look
                                    back upon that it seems the more strange when I realize that I defeated for the
                                    nomination two middle aged men, one of whom was holding his first term as
                                    Prosecutor. My official duties required me to visit 
                                        Vevay
                                     twice every year, to attend the regular term of court, and prosecute
                                    pleas of State. At the end of my first term I was reelected, and in the course of
                                    the four years that I held that office many interesting cases were tried at 
                                        Vevay
                                    , some of which awakened an interest in the entire county and caused
                                    neighborhoods to become partison. I recall one—the prosecution of the
                                    editor of one of the papers at 
                                        Vevay
                                     (I cannot now remember its name) for publishing what was alleged to be
                                    a libel upon the County Superintendent of Schools. The paper was a Democratic paper
                                    and the Superintendent was a Republican, and the people of the County became
                                    partisans pretty much as their political predilections influenced them. Another
                                    celebrated case of that time was the prosecution of a man by the name of Munson for
                                    forgery. Munson was a lightning rod agent and his family, if I remember correctly,
                                    were active Methodists at 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    . After his conviction I was besieged, as were all the County Officers,
                                    to secure his pardon, and this campaign for pardon lasted a great many months. In
                                    one murder case during my time, the Hon. Daniel W.  Voorhies, ever one of the greatest of advocates in
                                    homicide cases, was among the attorneys employed by the defense.
                        I was particularly interested in Miss Knox's reference to the hotel kept by
                                    Aunt Julia LeClere, and her reminiscences with reference to the older people. Aunt
                                    Julia's hotel was in many respects extremely excellent, and after having
                                    travelled far and wide I have found few places where better food was served at the
                                    table; but it did not have all the modern conveniences, not even of that day. There
                                    was no clerk and Aunt Julia, being a woman of most exemplary habits, adhered to the
                                    adage of "early to bed and early to rise". She would leave the
                                    front door of the hotel open, and on the counter would be as many candlesticks with
                                    candles in them as there were vacant rooms, and hanging on a keyrack the key to each
                                    room not already occupied. Those of us who came up from 
                                        Madison
                                     left on the 
                                        Louisville
                                     and 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     packet in the early evening and reached 
                                        Vevay
                                     generally between 11 and 1 o'clock. We would then walk up to
                                    the hotel, take our candle, light it and go up to the vacant room for which we got
                                    the key from the rack. I recall on one occasion having got off the boat with a
                                    gentleman whose acquaintance I had formed during the trip, and who proved to be the
                                    son of the Hon. Jesse D. Bright who had the misfortune to be on the wrong side at
                                    the beginning of the Civil War. When Mr. Bright and I arrived at the
                                    hotel—he was a stranger in 
                                        Vevay
                                     and I had informed him of the way the house was conducted—we
                                    found but one key on the rack and one candle. There being two of us, there was
                                    nothing to do but go up and at least look at the room. We found a comfortable room
                                    with two beds. Mr. Bright was a great talker, and although I needed sleep, as I had
                                    to be in Court the next morning, I got very little that night. While his
                                    conversation was interesting, I would have been glad to have foregone it for the
                                    sleep.
                        Another noteworthy recollection is of one of the floods which so frequently visited
                                    the Ohio River in those times. Judge James Y. Allison was the
                                    Circuit Judge, and he had to attend the Court. I do not remember whether he came up
                                    on a boat, or whether he came in a private conveyance, but when the week's
                                    term of court was over floodtides had so swollen the river that it had overflowed
                                    its banks, and boats could not run, as the paddles made waves that would have caused
                                    great damage. The roads to 
                                        Madison
                                     were also covered by water in many places, and our only way to get
                                    home, apparently, was to go in what we called in that day a skiff or a small yawl.
                                    The Judge and I hired an oarsman with a good stout boat and went down the twenty
                                    miles of a swift current to our homes in 
                                        Madison
                                     at floodtide.
                        For more than four decades I have been away from Indiana and have lived and traveled
                                    in many parts of the world, but it is a pleasure for memory to wander back over the
                                    pleasant years of my younger manhood, and particularly to recall how kind were the
                                    people of 
                                        Madison
                                     and 
                                        Vevay
                                     to a green country boy, who came among them to get started in his
                                    profession.
                     
                  
               
                
            
            Dr. Milo M. Quaife has very ably edited the 
                  Mississippi Valley
                        Historical Review for six years. He has rendered service of a high order, and it is with
                    deep regret that members of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association in
                    Indiana see him relinquish the editorship of the Review. They wish for his
                    well-prepared successor, Professor Arthur C. Cole of the Graduate School of Western Reserve
                    University, a long period of unalloyed success.
            The modest attempt to raise a fund of $100, in order that some small prizes might be
                    awarded to the authors of a few carefully prepared papers relating to Indiana History, failed. In
                    addition to the pledges made by Mr. Ross F. Lockridge, Dr. Christopher B. Coleman and the humble
                    writer of these lines, two other pledges were received prior to September 1. Since the full amount
                    was not subscribed by that date, each of the generous, would-be promoters of scholarly historical
                    writing in Indiana became exempt from the obligation. It is hoped that not one of them will squander
                    his ten dollars in a frivolous manner.
            One of the late pledges was made by a woman of Hoosier birth who has lived in 
                        Oregon
                     for some years but who still retains a deep interest in her native State. She requested
                    that her name should not be divulged as did the devotee of history who made the fifth and last
                    pledge. This gentleman wrote on August 31: 
                  
                     
                        While "catching up" on my file of the Indiana Magazine
                                        of History this lazy afternoon, I was successively prodded by my interest
                                    and conscience and your subtle appeals to attempt help at a very late date. If I am
                                    not too late "to crash the gates" please enter my Anonymous pledge for ten dollars to your $100 for prizes. My
                                    weighty contribution will be in honor of the heroic founder of the Magazine and his foot-press.
                     
                  
               
                
            The Editor has no present plan to make further efforts to raise a prize fund. He
                    will not resort to a "drive" nor solicit pledges by personal appeals. Unless he is
                    swamped by pro-tests accompanied by five or ten dollar pledges, nothing further will appear anent
                    the matter on the pages of this department.
         
         
         
            Reprints
            Reprints of any paper published in the Indiana Magazine of History may be obtained
                    by any contributor. Estimates of the cost will be furnished on request and an order placed for as
                    many reprints of any article as may be desired by the author.
         
         
            Wanted
            We are sure that some of our readers can aid us to obtain the desired publications listed below. The
                    Library of Indiana University and other libraries in different parts of the country are in need of
                    copies of the issues mentioned in order to complete files. For older and rarer numbers, prices above
                    the regular rates will be paid. Persons possessing any of the desired magazines or other

               Indiana Magazine of History. We have had a generous response to our appeals for
                    back numbers, especially for those dated later than 1914. We have a serious need for copies of
                    issues from 1905 to 1912. We very much desire to locate the four numbers of volume IV (1908); number
                    one of volume VI (1910); the four numbers of volume VII (1911); the four numbers of vol. VIII
                    (1912). We will buy further copies of the following issues: Dec., 1921; Mar., 1922; double-number
                    June-Sept., 1925.
            Full sets of the Magazine can be supplied to libraries or individuals who may
                    desire to purchase only with great difficulty. A complete file from 1920 forward can be supplied at
                    fifty-cents a copy or two dollars per volume, unbound; from 1914 to 1919, the price is one dollar
                    per copy, or four dollars per volume; a file from 1905-1913, when it can be supplied at all, must be
                    priced at a much higher figure.
         
         
            General Index
            The General Index for volumes I-XXV of the Indiana Magazine of
                    History prepared by Miss Dorothy Riker of the Indiana Historical Bureau is now ready for
                    distribution. Orders received in advance of publication have either been filled or copies will be
                    mailed with this issue of the Magazine. The expense of printing has been quite
                    large and the edition is limited. It is not possible to furnish copies free to libraries or to
                    members of the Indiana Historical Society, but a nominal price of $1.00 only is being
                    charged. Orders will be filled at  this price until January 1,
                    1931, after which the charge will be $2.00 per copy. The Index will
                    prove very useful to all libraries possessing complete or partial files of the Magazine. It should also prove valuable to individual members of the Indiana Historical
                    Society, and it is hoped that many will order copies before the end of the year.
