                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                    <l><hi>IN</hi> the childhood of April, while purple woods</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">With the young yearâs blood in them smiled,</l>
                    <l>I passed through the lanes and the wakened fields,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And stood by the grave of the child.</l>
                    <l>And the pain awoke that is never dead</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Though it sometimes sleeps, and again</l>
                    <l>It set its teeth in this heart of mine,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And fastened its claws in my brain:</l>
                    <l>It was hard and hard that the little hands</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And the little wellâloved head</l>
                    <l>Should be out of reach of our living lips,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And be side by side with the dead.</l>
                    <l>For with trees about where the brown birds build,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And with long green grass above,</l>
                    <l>She lies in the cold sweet breast of earth</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Beyond the reach of our love;</l>
                    <l>Whatever befalls in the coarse loud world,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">We know she will never wake.</l>
                    <l>When I thought of the sorrow she might have known,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">I was almost glad for her sake. . . .</l>
                    <l>Tears might have tired those kissâclosed eyes,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Grief hardened the mouth I kissed;</l>
                    <l>I was almost glad that my dear was dead</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Because of the pain she had missed.</l>
                    <l>Oh, if I could but have died a child</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">With a white childâsoul like hers,</l>
                    <l>As pure as the windâflowers down in the copse,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Where the soul of the springtime stirs;</l>
                    <l>Or if I had only done with it all,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And might lie by her side unmoved!</l>
                    <l>I envied the very clods of earth</l>

                    <l>And my soul rose up in revolt at life,</l>

                    <l>The brown earth looked like the brown sea rocks,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">The tombstones were white like spray,</l>

                    <l rend="ti-1">I saw the dead lie low,</l>
                    <l>Who had worked and suffered and found life sad,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">So many sad years ago.</l>
                    <l>Unchanged by time I saw them lie</l>

                    <l>There were some who had found the green world so grey,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">They had left it before their time,</l>
                    <l>And some were little ones like my dear,</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">And some had died in their prime;</l>
                    <l>And some were old, they had had their fill</l>
                    <l rend="ti-1">Of bitter unfruitful hours;</l>
                    <l>And I knew that none of them, none, had known</l>

                    <l>So I walked in the warm wet byâways, not daring to lift my eyes</l>

                    <l>And the world cried out, âWe will crown him, he sings of the lights that
                        are,</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>I said, âNow my brows are laurelled, my hands filled full of their gold,</l>

                    <l>It is time to sing of my star!â for I dreamed that my star still shone,</l>
                    <l>Then I lifted my eyes in my triumph. Night! night! and my star was gone.</l>

                <l>Oneâs heart had oneâs eyes on fire,</l>
                <l>And never a spark in oneâs brain.</l>

                <l>One can suffer still, indeed,</l>

                <l>There, give old daddy a kiss,</l>

                <l>Cannot you fetch it back?</l>
                <l>Did I frighten my little ones?</l>

                <l>If he canât do his writing. Vain!</l>
                <l>I shall never write again!</l>
                <l>Oh, God! was it like a love divine</l>

                    <p>A priest tells how, in his youth, a church was built by the free labour of
                        loveâas was menâs wont in those days; and how the stone and wood were paid
                        for by one who had grown rich on usury and the pillage of the poorâand of
                        what chanced thereafter.</p>
