                <p>This issue of the IMH is the first in our 100th year of publication. It focuses on the Civil War,
                    that perennial favorite topic among readers of American history-both here in Indiana (at least to
                    judge from the results of our 2004 readersâ€™ poll) and across the country. One hundredand-forty years
                    after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the events of the war-and the clashing principles that led to them-continue to draw
                    public interest to a degree that is nearly unmatched among the signal events of the nation's
                    history. Our reviews and review notices for this issue reflect that continued interest; we have
                    included a number of relevant recent titles that we feel will interest specialists and general
                    readers alike. For the main article, we return to a format that the IMH has often featured over its
                    century-long run: the unpublished memoir-in this case, a manuscript of recollections by a Hoosier
                    soldier who served in the 93rd Indiana Regiment across the Western Theater of the war. The
                    document-found, transcribed, and annotated by George P. Clark of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Kentuckyis augmented here both by Clark's own introduction and by remarks from
                    historian J. D. Fowler, who sets its contents into the context of other war memoirs.</p>
                <p>Finally, we look at the man who led the nation during its most difficult hour but did not live to
                    preside over its healing. Historian Darrel Bigham examines one of the most significant collections
                    of Lincoln images ever amassed: the Smith and Weinberg collections recently acquired by the Indiana
                    Historical Society. Leading our review section, Lincoln historian Daniel Stowell analyzes a group of
                    books that take on the difficult question of Lincoln's relation to the Constitution. This review
                    essay, the first of two that Stowell will write for these pages, is just one of a number of periodic
                    features on Lincoln that will appear in the IMH in anticipation of the state's bicentennial
                    commemoration of the president's birth-and subsequent Indiana boyhood-in 2009.</p>
                <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-101-1-008"/>
                <p>The Civil War also provides a starting point for a long-term, online project intended to aid
                    primary-and secondary-school history and social studies teachers. Through this effort we hope to
                    increase access to a wealth of primary documents from the IMH's one-hundred-plus volumes. We begin
                    with fifty-five documents, mostly letters and journals, relating to Civil War soldiers. For a list,
                    go to http://www.indiana.edu/~imaghist. Linked to each document you will find an abstract of its
                    contents, some representative quotations, and additional information such as each soldier's county
                    of residence and regiment. In the coming months, the texts of these and other documents will be
                    available in PDF format; we will also be working with a team of educators from Indiana
                    University-Purdue University <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> County Schools, under the auspices of a Teaching American History grant from the
                    National Endowment for the Humanities, to provide lesson plans and accompanying suggestions for how
                    to use these materials in the classroom.</p>
                <p>Finally, as this issue was going to press, we received word of the death of longtime IMH editor
                    Donald Carmony Carmony, age 95, was a pioneer in the writing and teaching of Indiana history and he
                    left a major mark upon this journal. We will feature more thoughts on his life and legacy in an
                    upcoming issue.</p>

                <byline>J. D. FOWLER</byline>
                <p>Louis Bir was a typical Civil War soldier in most respects. He was young, only nineteen years old at
                    the time of his enlistment in the Ninety-Third Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862, and he
                    was anxious for a grand adventure. For the remainder of the war, Bir traveled across the Western
                    Theater, experiencing the horrors of combat, the agony of wounds, and the monotony of camp life.
                    Fortunately for future generations of historians, Bir was atypical of most Civil War soldiers in
                    that he left a record of his experiences. This record offers a fascinating glimpse into the life of
                    one "Billy Yank."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                </figure>
                <p>Bir's reminiscences, like other recollections of the war, paint a poignant picture of the hardships
                    of army life. He vividly describes his hunger, the poor quality of food, and his many marches across
                    the southern countryside. Because it was produced by, about, and for members of a unit or fellow
                    veterans, Bir's account is categorized as a firstgeneration narrative. Often these records have
                    serious limitations for students of the war. Many of the authors penned their histories decades
                    after the events described, allowing time and distance to cloud memories <pb n="5"
                        id="VAA4025-101-1-011"/> and distort recollections. In addition, first-generation histories
                    almost always portray the author and his unit favorably. Incidents of cowardice, desertion, or
                    ineptitude often are not mentioned or are presented as aberrations. Also, these narratives, while
                    usually paying hagiographical tributes to brigade and regimental officers, tend to omit important
                    details about the heart of all Civil War regiments-the fighting men.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Sergeant Bir's account, however, is different from unit histories in two important ways. First, it is
                    not actually a unit history but rather a personal memoir. Apparently, Bir intended his recollections
                    to be delivered as an oral presentation, perhaps to his fellow veterans in the Grand Army of the
                    Republic. Also, his recollections offer us an unsanitized view of the war. Indeed, the most striking
                    aspect of Bir's memoir, and what truly makes it unique, is the author's honesty. Bir's willingness
                    to admit to being a thief, an immature boy who cried over practical jokes, and a racist gives much
                    credibility to his entire story.</p>
                <p>Several key points emerge that highlight the importance of this work. For example, it is odd that Bir
                    does not give a reason for his enlistment. He does not express any patriotic sentiment, nor does he
                    mention any community or kinship pressure he may have experienced. Either Bir expected his audience
                    to understand his motivations for fighting for the Union, or he did not consider them worth
                    mentioning. Perhaps if he intended his audience to be other veterans, he felt comfortable enough to
                    let his guard down and speak openly about issues and events that other veterans would understand.
                    For example, Bir talks candidly about pillaging with his comrades. Their bounty included pies, a
                    turkey, chickens, honey, and a calf. He recalls a southern woman pleading with him <list

                            <hi rend="sup">2</hi> A handful of historians have attempted to generate modern scholarly
                            regimental studies using a variety of primary sources, including individual military

                            motivation, socioeconomic status, war weariness, and the daily routine and struggles of
                            ordinary combat soldiers.</item>

                    she had. However, he confesses that the Union troops ignored the old woman's pleas, killed the
                    animal, and carried it away while being pursued by Rebel troops. Obviously, Bir felt no guilt for
                    his actions, nor, apparently, did he care if his audience viewed him negatively.</p>
                <p>Bir's memoir contains several graphic passages related to combat. He remembers killing his first man
                    as his regiment retreated following Nathan <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> Forrest's rout of Union forces at Brice's Crossroads. Even though Bir had undoubtedly
                    fired into Rebel ranks before, perhaps wounding and killing any number of soldiers, this was the
                    first time he had watched a man die in front of him and realized that he had taken a life. The
                    memoir also contains gruesome reminders of the horrors of war. At the battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> he writes of seeing the man next to him cut in half by a shell and watching as his
                    internal organs emerged from the shattered body. Later, as night brought an end to the fighting, he
                    could not sleep because a Rebel soldier lying nearby had suffered a ghastly head wound. Bir watched
                    and listened in horror as the soldier's brains oozed out with each of his final breaths. Such
                    graphic portrayal is real and brings the brutality of war home to the reader.</p>
                <p>Bir's account is also interesting because he neglects to discuss the Confederate soldiers in detail.
                    In fact, he rarely refers to the Rebels as individuals. One gets the sense that they are simply the
                    enemy. However, while Bir may have dehumanized his opponents, he does not apparently hate them. In
                    fact, he makes no derogatory comments about the Rebels other than the mention that he and his
                    comrades contracted lice by sleeping in an abandoned Confederate camp. He does remember Confederates
                    shooting prisoners, but he also describes his anger over Union troops executing Rebel captives. He
                    tells about the time a Rebel allowed him to ride a horse during an exhausting march toward
                    Andersonville, and he recalls how he enjoyed listening to the Confederate bands sent to entertain
                    the Federal troops at night. Even the death of his childhood friend does not appear to evoke rage or
                    hatred. Indeed, Bir does not seem to have harbored any overt hatred for the men who tried to kill
                    him for three years. In a sense, the Confederate forces appear to be just another obstacle, like the
                    weather or lack of food, that must be overcome.</p>
                <p>While Bir seems indifferent to southern soldiers, he apparently liked southern civilians. He became
                    infatuated with a girl in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, visiting her after the war to see if the spark could be reignited. Also, during a
                    stint at occupation duty near Meridian, he helped local planters <pb n="7" id="VAA4025-101-1-013"/>
                    convince the newly freed slaves to remain on the plantations as free laborers. Bir was forced to
                    kill a freedman while performing his policing duties. His only regret was having to ride sixty miles
                    round trip to report the killing to the nearest Provost Marshal. Bir's callousness here reveals one
                    of the least likeable facets of his personality, but it is one of the most important dimensions of
                    his memoir-racism. While Civil War scholars have documented that the overwhelming majority of white
                    Union troops were as racist as their southern counterparts, this fact is often lost on the general
                    public. Less than ten percent of the white northern public harbored abolitionist sentiment by 1860,
                    and many of those individuals would be considered racist by modern standards. Many white Union
                    troops, especially those from the Midwest, did not like African Americans and resisted the idea that
                    they were fighting for emancipation. While it cannot be denied that southern slave holders were
                    fighting to perpetuate the institution, it is equally true that the majority of white Union troops
                    could have cared less about the fate of the slaves. For them, the Union remained their cause.
                    Indeed, as historians of the war have noted, virtually all white Union troops supported the war to
                    save the Union, and if they supported emancipation, it was only as a war aim designed to weaken the
                        South.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Bir's work shows clearly that he and his comrades were products of their society's racial and ethnic
                    biases. In addition to the racism portrayed, Bir mentions the looting by Union forces of
                    Jewish-owned businesses in Cairo, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and the unwillingness of Union commanders to stop it. Bir himself stole a barrel of
                    eggs while others tossed a hog through the window of a Jewish merchant's shop. Bir even recalled
                    seeing one of his comrades "shoot down" a Jew who would not grant him credit.</p>
                <p>Bir's honesty is disturbing yet refreshing. Many post-war accounts were carefully sanitized and
                    self-serving. Since Bir intended for his reminiscences to be read to fellow veterans at reunions, he
                    apparently believed that his audience would be receptive to his positions and experiences. We, of
                    course, do not know how his stories were received or if those present shared similar attitudes.

                    importance of the lumber industry in supplying material for camps and fortifications. And back home

                <p>Louis Bir's account of his Civil War has been preserved by his descendants in its original form as 39
                    loosely bound manuscript pages pencilled many years after the war on the backs of 8 1/2" x 11"
                    printed business forms at hand in his office. In 1961, a typescript in solid capital letters (to
                    avoid capitalization problems) was made by Mrs. Harry E. Bir, wife of a grandson of the author.
                    About 30 years later, Bir's granddaughter, Jeanne Bir Needham, typed the document with largely
                    conventional spelling and punctuation. In recent years the manuscript, in family possession, has
                    deteriorated somewhat. Missing text has had to be supplied from the 1961 typescript.</p>
                <p>Bir wrote fluently with little self-correction. The greatest problem in bringing his writing to the
                    printed page is his disregard for the niceties of spelling and capitalization. Totally faithful
                    reproduction of his spelling seems hardly possible. It is no revelation that most soldiers, North
                    and South, had minimal writing experience. The value of Bir's memoir is that even though composed
                    many years after the war, it presents with fidelity the experiences and attitudes of a youthful
                    volunteer from southern Indiana who participated in several significant contests of the Civil War,
                    including the Siege of Vicksburg and the Battle of <placeName>

                    Theater where he soldiered. And he gives these details with the immediacy one might expect in an
                    account fresh upon the experience of battle.</p>

                            <hi rend="sup">âˆ—</hi> The original manuscript contains forty handwritten pages, with two
                            numbered pages 22 and 34. In general, the right edges of the sheets suffer from
                            disintegration or curling. Some pages have deteriorated along the top edge; two pages have a
                            hole in the center; and the first and last pages exhibit additional wear from serving as the
                            de facto cover. Missing text has been supplied in square brackets and has been taken from
                            the 1961 typescript.</p>
                        <p>Primary transcription and footnoting were carried out by George P. Clark, with additions by
                            the editorial staff of the IMH. The editors retained all original ampersands, dashes, and
                            underlining. Bir did not use periods (except for abbreviations), commas, or apostrophes. He
                            used hyphens at the ends of some sentences and equal signs as dashes. New paragraphs,
                            indicated here with indentation, were usually indicated by a break at the end of one line
                            and the beginning of the next line at the left margin.</p>
                        <p>Bir's spelling has been maintained as accurately as possible. He characteristically omitted
                            the final "e" from place names such as <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement> and <settlement type="city"
                                >Gainesville</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and he frequently dropped one of the double consonants from words such as
                            battle and off. A few unclear words have been provided in square brackets. Names of people,
                            places, and ships have been capitalized. Bir did not distinguish between lower-and
                            upper-case forms of the letters a, m, n, and y; these ambiguous letters have been
                            capitalized according to modern convention.</p>

                            hill in five minutes unless he was ordered not to do so. Thomas wanted to coordinate efforts
                            for a maximum assault, but his message did not reach McArthur in time. The eighteen guns in

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> (which holds the second largest collection of Lincoln materials in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> after the Library of Congress).</p>
                <p>In 2003 one of these repositories made a significant addition to its collection. The Indiana
                    Historical Society already possessed a Lincoln collection of more than 300 objects, including a leaf
                    from a sum book Lincoln used as a boy, manuscripts from his presidential years, and written
                    reminiscences of him by those who knew him as a child and young man. Thanks to a $2.9 million grant
                    from the Lilly Endowment, the society has now acquired approximately 800 additional items from two
                    Lincoln collectors. The Jack Smith Lincoln Graphics Collection, by far the larger of the two,
                    consists of photographs, lithographs, engravings, and busts of Lincoln. Collected by Jack L. Smith
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and focused on 1860-1865 and the post-assassination years, these items comprise one of
                    the most important groupings of Lincoln images anywhere. The grant also enabled the IHS to acquire
                    the Daniel R. Weinberg Lincoln Conspirators Collection, which consists of photographs, manuscripts,
                    books, pamphlets, and newspapers relating to the president's assassination. Weinberg, owner of the
                    Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, sold the most significant artifact of the entire acquisition: the original collodion
                    wet-plate negative of a photograph of Lincoln by Alexander Gardner. One of the best-known Lincoln
                    images, it was taken eleven days before the president delivered the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Address on November 19, 1863.</p>
                <p>According to IHS President and CEO Salvatore Cilella, Jr., the new purchases resulted from
                    "incredible coincidences." Cilella visited Weinberg in the summer of 2002 to encourage him to
                    participate in the society's Rare Book and Map Fair as well as to purchase a copy of Weinberg's
                    recently published book on Lincoln's assassins. From that visit came the opportunity to purchase the
                    assassination materials. Weinberg also encouraged Cilella to meet with Smith, whose huge collection
                    of Lincolniana covered every wall in his home, the walls of his office, and the hallways at his
                    corrugated paper box manufacturing company, but also filled his private, two-story gallery in
                    downtown <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Smith, who had experienced a serious heart attack that summer, later recalled to a
                    reporter that he thought he should "â€˜do something about this collectionâ€™ â€¦ [H]e did not want his

                </p>
                <p>The IHS's acquisition of these two important collections provides much greater access to Lincoln
                    materials-not just to those visiting the society's library and its planned Lincoln exhibits, but
                    also to anyone with access to the Internet. All of the Lincoln materials have been digitized and
                    made available through the society's website.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The physical collection became
                    available for use at the society's library in February 2005, when the exhibition "The Faces of
                    Lincoln" also opened. In addition, a grant from Bank One will allow the society to bring these new
                    collections into the K-12 classroom. Portions of the collection will be used in traveling
                    exhibitions, and the visual images from the collection will be highlighted in a forthcoming book to
                    be published by the society's press.</p>
                <p>The IHS's acquisition of Lincoln materials is significant, in short, in adding to the quality and
                    accessibility of Lincolniana held in Hoosier collections. Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s Lincoln Museum possesses a similarly large collection of lithographs, prints,
                    etchings, engravings, and other artifacts that reflect the many ways in which Lincoln's image
                    permeated popular culture during his presidency and afterwards. The Lilly Library's collection is
                    similar, although smaller than the other two. Together, the three collections constitute an
                    important part of the IHS's plan to develop a heritage trail linking the southwest part of the
                    state, where Lincoln lived as a boy, to central and northeastern Indiana. The three repositories
                    hope, moreover, to create a database of their Lincoln materials that would make all of these
                    collections available to scholars and educators worldwide.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                <p>The IHS's Lincoln materials are primarily visual-iconographic images. These are a valuable means of
                    telling the Lincoln story not just as illustrations that supplement the written record, but also as
                    evidence of the regard with which fellow Americans held Lincoln before and after his death.<hi
                        rend="sup">5</hi> Because of technological advancements in photography and printing, Lincoln was
                    the first president whose image became wellknown to most Americans. The mass marketing of prints-in
                    a time before television and the internet-made it possible for candidates to distribute their
                    pictures to the public and made high-quality printed images affordable for ordinary people. Lincoln
                    and his campaign managers understood the power of the press and believed it was vital for images of
                    him to be flattering. Consequently many included a more pleasing appearance, with a restyled nose,
                    eyes or hair. Images of Lincoln became plentiful during his 1860 campaign via posters, sheet music,
                    paintings, and prints that were available through bookstores, newspaper offices, and the mail.</p>
                <p>When Lincoln grew a beard after his election, printers rushed to create new, updated images.
                    Newspapers did not have the technology to reproduce the few photographs available to them and
                    instead used engravings made from the photos. One of the most widely adapted was the photograph
                    taken by Matthew Brady just before the Cooper Union address in February 1860.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                </p>
                <p>During Lincoln's presidency many prints included members of his family, often in pastoral settings;
                    others focused on patriotic symbols, especially connections with George and Martha <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Lithographs and engravings of prominent men and events of the Civil War also appeared,
                    especially after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. The president's assassination led to
                    still more images-representations of the shooting; of his final hours on his deathbed with his
                    family, cabinet members, and generals; of the honors by thousands of citizens as his body lay in
                    state and was returned to <placeName>

                    soldier. He began purchasing prints of Lincoln and Ulysses Grant in 1959. Over forty years he
                    acquired 752 objects that provided a visual record of Lincoln's life, from humble beginnings to the
                    presidency to his lasting image as an American icon. The collection shows Lincoln as politician,
                    family man, and national martyr.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                <p>All of the Lincoln collections have finding aids and a detailed description of each item. The Jack
                    Smith Collection has been catalogued into seventeen series: Boyhood, Campaigns and Elections,
                    Political Cartoons, Presidency, Politicians, Civil War, White House Years, Quotes and Speeches,
                    Emancipation, Assassination and Death, Iconography, Family, Mary Todd, Residences, Graphic
                    Portraits, Photographic Portraits, and Statues, Busts, and Plaques. Each series is organized
                    alphabetically by artist and title. The composition of the collection is quantitatively uneven.
                    Graphic Portraits, with nearly two hundred items, constitutes the largest series. Iconography ranks
                    second, with eighty-six. Following that are Assassination and Death, with seventyeight; Photographic
                    Portraits, with sixty-eight; and Statues, Busts, and Plaques, with sixty-seven. Together, these five
                    series account for twothirds of the collection. Of the remaining twelve series, Boyhood includes the
                    least number of items (seven) and Family the most (thirtyeight).</p>

                    in the Residences series, although they might have been better placed in Iconography). Eleven

                    physically shorter.) Several demonstrate how obsolete items could be resold. The print "Apotheosis

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    1861 with Lincoln's head on John C. Calhoun's body. (It was remade one more time, after Lincoln grew
                    a beard.)</p>
                <p>The series of political cartoons from the 1860 campaign provides a number of unflattering portraits
                    of the Republican candidate for president. The graphic portraits include Lincoln's image on "La Flor
                    de Lincoln," a cigar box label. The photographic portraits series contains the first and the last
                    photographs taken of Lincoln. The family series includes mostly idyllic scenes of the Lincoln family
                    together. These are composite creations, using individual photographs to create posed family
                    settings, since the family was never photographed together.</p>

                <p>Daniel R. Weinberg assembled the materials that constitute the Daniel R. Weinberg Collection for a
                    book that was published in 2001.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> He has been in the business of purchasing,
                    selling, and appraising items of Americana since 1971. His specializations are in Lincolniana, the
                    American Civil War, and the American presidency. He has helped to build some of the major
                    collections in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and has lectured to a number of historical groups.</p>
                <p>The Weinberg Collection comprises six series: Assassination, Apprehension, Trial, Execution,
                    Transportation, and Books and Pamphlets. Numerically, the twenty-seven books and pamphlets relating
                    to the conspiracy, published between 1865 and 1997, constitute the largest of the six series. The
                    next largest is the Execution series, which includes the photographs of Alexander Gardner, the only
                    person whom the War Department allowed to document the executions. Many will consider them the most
                    poignant of the images in this group.</p>
                <p>The collection contains artifacts, manuscripts, newspapers, and photographs. Artifacts and newspapers
                    account for the smallest number of items (three each). The manuscript collection of twenty-seven
                    items includes eight letters and Winfield Scott <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hancock</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s copy of the original order of execution, used on the scaffold by General John
                    Hartranft to read the charges to the prisoners. Photographs, many of them dealing with the
                    execution, constitute half of the collection.</p>
                <p>The public's demand for news, set in the context of the recent murder of the president and the end of
                    the Civil War, spurred the demand for photographs of those who had allegedly conspired with John
                    Wilkes Booth to kill Lincoln and to attempt to kill members of his cabinet. The physical appearance
                    of the prisoners attracted great public interest, because at the time looks were considered
                    important evidence of character. One item in the collection is an albumen carte-de-visite featuring
                    a composite of photographs of seven male conspirators, including Booth. The eighth person tried for
                    conspiracy was boarding-house keeper Mary Surratt, whose son was linked to John Wilkes Booth and
                    whose boarders included Lewis Powell, the would-be assassin of Secretary of State William Seward.

                    Surratt's execution had been vindictive). The collection includes a lithograph of Mrs. Surratt, as
                    no photographs were taken of her between her arrest and execution. This was the public's only means
                    of knowing what she looked like. The military tribunal's decision that four should die and the
                    others spend their lives in prison was endorsed by President Johnson and announced to the public

                    his life. Within a year he began to devote most of his time to the new art form. He and his family

                <p>Gardner initiated contact with Brady, who hired him and placed him in charge of his <placeName>

                    displacing the daguerreotype and quickly gained a reputation for being an outstanding photographer.
                    The coming of the war brought him substantial business, as soldiers wanted to be photographed in
                    uniform before going to the front line. Gardner's relationship with Allan Pinkerton, head of the
                    intelligence operation later known as the Secret Service, helped him to secure appointments as chief
                    photographer in the U. S. Topographical Engineers and as a member of the staff of General George
                    McClellan. Gardner's management of Brady's studio in <placeName>

                    photograph battle scenes thereafter.</p>
                <p>Gardner took photographs of Lincoln on seven separate occasions. The photograph taken eleven days

                <p>We are fortunate that the Indiana Historical Society has enhanced its Lincoln collections so
                    substantially and made them accessible to the public in such a variety of ways. Teachers in visual
                    arts as well as social studies and language arts, for example, should be able to utilize these
                    objects to demonstrate the evolution of photographic technology, the use of photographs in creating
                    mass-produced images for newspapers and other media, the impact of such images in a pre-electronic
                    time, and the use of visual imagery in the American political process. The many examples of
                    iconography provide ample opportunity to encourage reflection on the process whereby the collective
                    memory of a people is created.</p>

                <p>Although there are more books written about Abraham Lincoln than any other American, his life
                    continues to be a perennial source for investigation and reinterpretation. Jurists, whether they are
                    lawyers, judges, or law professors, bring a unique perspective to the study of Lincoln's life and
                    legacy. Because his quarter-century legal career shaped his thoughts and actions as president and
                    because he faced some of the most challenging constitutional crises in the nation's history, legal
                    scholars have asked many questions about Abraham Lincoln and the law. These three volumes
                    demonstrate that jurists can offer new insights into our understanding of Lincoln's presidency and
                    the Civil War.</p>

                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University Law Professor George R Fletcher argues that "the Civil War called forth a
                    new constitutional order," based on the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
                    Amendments to the Constitution <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-101-1-078"/> (p. 2). These amendments
                    established a second American constitution with principles in sharp contrast to the Constitution of
                    1787. While the original document was based on the principles of "peoplehood as a voluntary
                    association, individual freedom, and republican elitism," the principles of this second constitution
                    were "organic nationhood, equality of all persons, and popular democracy" (p. 2). These competing
                    visions have struggled for supremacy in American life since the Civil War era.</p>
                <p>In Fletcher's interpretation, Lincoln's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address serves as "the preamble of the second American constitution" and "the secular
                    prayer of the postbellum American Republic" (p. 4). Unfortunately for America, Fletcher contends,
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court in the late nineteenth century truncated the promise of this second
                    constitution through its judgments in the <hi rend="i">Slaughterhouse</hi> (1873) and <hi rend="i"
                        >Civil Rights</hi> (1883) cases. These and other decisions effectively nullified the promise of
                    the postwar amendments and drove the second constitution underground, where it became America's
                    "Secret Constitution" throughout the twentieth century. Although it did not predominate in the
                    decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court, the Secret Constitution "has, in fact, a much deeper grounding
                    in American political and legal culture, and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas" (p.
                    189). From this location deep in the nation's legal culture, the commitments of the Secret
                    Constitution shaped subsequent constitutional amendments; according to Fletcher, the fourteen
                    amendments since the Civil War "were all designed to further the causes of nationhood, equality, and
                    popular democracy" (p. 7).</p>
                <p>While Fletcher provides an imaginative and thought-provoking overview of American constitutional
                    history, his analysis is based on some problematic assumptions and interpretations, both about the
                    nature of law and about the historical record of Lincoln's presidency and the Civil War amendments.
                    In his discussion of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address, Fletcher dismisses the ideas of those scholars and jurists who concern
                    themselves with the "original intent" of laws and amendments as intellectually and morally
                    "impoverished" (p. 30). What Lincoln intended does not matter; the words of his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address are the preamble to a new constitutional order because "we came to understand
                    them as nearly sacred" (p. 33). Likewise, the purposes for which Congress proposed and the states
                    ratified the postwar amendments are less important than the meaning that later generations attached
                    to them. For Fletcher, laws, amendments, constitutions, and even speeches seem to be empty vessels
                    into which each generation of Americans has poured its own meanings.</p>
                <p>Fletcher's characterization of Lincoln's attitudes toward the Constitution and the laws is equally
                    flawed. Citing "Lincoln's casual attitude toward formal constitutional institutions, <pb n="73"
                        id="VAA4025-101-1-079"/> such as the writ of habeas corpus," Fletcher insists that Lincoln was
                    committed to higher principles of law (p. 5). To support this position, Fletcher relies on Robert
                    Penn <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s apology for the South <hi rend="i">(The Legacy of the Civil War: Meditations on the
                        Centennial,</hi> 1961) and overlooks Mark Neely's careful studies of wartime civil liberties in
                    both the North and the South <hi rend="i">(The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil
                    Liberties,</hi> 1991; <hi rend="i">Southern Rights: Political Prisoners and the Myth of Confederate
                        Constitutionalism,</hi> 1999). Neely found that both the Lincoln and Davis administrations
                    sacrificed civil liberties to the larger goals of retaining territory and winning the war. Fletcher
                    consistently underestimates Lincoln's reverence for the Constitution in limiting his actions as
                    President, and he insists that Lincoln failed to justify his actions when he asked, in his July 4,
                    1861, message to Congress: "Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the government itself go
                    to pieces lest that one be violated?" Fletcher blithely declares that "there is no evidence that the
                    country's circumstances were anywhere near this flashpoint of imminent destruction" (p. 38).
                    However, he neglects the very real concerns in the spring of 1861 that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., would be cut off from the rest of the North by Confederate sympathizers in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The earliest Union regiments to reach the beleaguered capital city literally had to

                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>Fletcher concludes his chronicle of the strange career of the Secret Constitution with an analysis of
                    the Supreme Court's role in the 2000 Presidential election: "No single incident better demonstrated
                    how torn our psyches were between the procedures laid down in 1787 and modified in 1803 and the new
                    principles of democracy that were born in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> Address and anchored in the Secret Constitution" (p. 234). Although the election
                    initially appeared to vindicate the democratic commitments of the Secret Constitution, "in the end
                    the resolution bore many resemblances to the high-handed intervention of the power-brokers in 1876"
                    (p. 238).</p>
                <p>While Fletcher views Lincoln's actions and the Reconstruction amendments through the lens of his
                    Secret Constitution interpretation, legal scholar Daniel Farber pursues a more modest goal in <hi
                        rend="i">Lincoln's Constitution.</hi> Farber recognizes that during the Civil War, "the
                    Constitution was placed under pressure that it had never seen before and has not seen since" (p. 1).
                    The Civil War raised many fundamental constitutional questions, including the nature of the Union
                    and the scope of presidential authority. During the war, Lincoln did not become a dictator, but "he
                    did stretch the power of the presidency to its outer reaches" (p. 20).</p>
                <p>Farber seeks to understand Lincoln within his historical context, but he also employs the
                    unconventional method of comparing Lincoln's actions to modern conceptions of executive authority as
                    well. Farber <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-101-1-080"/> carefully examines southern constitutional
                    arguments for secession and finds them "ultimately unpersuasive" (p. 81). He then considers whether
                    the federal government had the constitutional power to coerce states into remaining in the Union and
                    concludes that "secession was a lawless act, to which the government was legally and morally
                    entitled to respond with force" (p. 112).</p>
                <p>Farber next turns to Lincoln's authority as President, in contrast to the power of Congress, to act
                    in response to secession. Here, Farber suggests that Lincoln may have been wrong according to the
                    partially formed standards of his day but that he has been vindicated by history. Although many
                    scholars might stumble headlong into presentism by employing this approach, Farber effectively uses
                    subsequent legal precedents to evaluate Lincoln's actions as president. In doing so, he offers a
                    different angle of vision from that of a legal historian but carefully provides specific insights
                    rather than sweeping generalizations.</p>
                <p>In his consideration of Lincoln's initial response to secession, Farber finds that "Lincoln remained
                    very much a democratic leader throughout the war" (p. 115). Congress in August 1861 legalized and
                    validated most of Lincoln's actions in the spring of 1861. With the partial exception of <hi
                        rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi> in 1866, postwar U. S. Supreme Court decisions largely validated
                    the degree of presidential power exercised by Lincoln. Farber does not shy away from criticism of
                    Lincoln, however. He finds the president's call for volunteers and his use of federal funds in the
                    early stage of the war hard to defend constitutionally, but he believes that "the Union marched to
                    war in general compliance with the Constitution" (p. 143).</p>
                <p>Although Lincoln's suppression of civil liberties was not a sign of impending dictatorship, it was a
                    serious constitutional issue. Lincoln's use of military trials in contested border areas was
                    "probably constitutional" although restrictions on freedoms of speech and the press in secure areas
                    were not. He also failed to hold his subordinates to a strict standard for suppressing speech and
                    went too far in defending them. Farber is more critical of Lincoln's disobedience of a court order
                    in <hi rend="i">Ex parte Merryman</hi> (1861), an action that Farber considers to have been
                    "unlawful" (p. 192). Farber concludes that, on balance, Lincoln's was not "a perfect record, but a
                    creditable one, under incredibly trying circumstances" (p. 197).</p>
                <p>Chief Justice Frank J. Williams of the Supreme Court of <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> has been a lifelong student of Abraham Lincoln and currently serves on the federal
                    Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. His collection of essays on topics as diverse as Lincoln's
                    record on civil liberties, the women in Lincoln's life, and collecting Lincolniana demonstrates the
                    breadth of Williams's interests in Lincoln. From his perspective on the bench, Justice Williams
                    insists that "each generation makes its own Lincoln, and he may not be the Lincoln <pb n="75"
                        id="VAA4025-101-1-081"/> known before" (p. 12). At first glance, this statement sounds much like
                    Fletcher's insistence that Lincoln's words and actions have merely the meaning subsequent
                    generations ascribe to them, but Williams is more cautious and faithful to the historical record.
                    For Williams, perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of Lincoln was his leadership style: he
                    remained flexible enough to learn from others, including the women in his life and his political
                    opponents, yet strong enough to secure the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to end slavery.</p>
                <p>Lincoln's law practice was "a springboard to reach his political goals, and this contributed to his
                    later success as president and commander in chief (pp. 34-35). He was always a politician and a
                    lawyer simultaneously, and when he became president, "Lincoln always operated within the constraints
                    of the law, recognizing that power in a democracy always requires checks and balances" (p. 51).
                    Williams admires Lincoln's "constitutional flexibility." In dealing with civil liberties in the
                    wartime North, Lincoln could "bend the Constitution within the framework of its intent without
                    breaking it" (p. 77). He could also hold national elections during a civil war, while working
                    assiduously to ensure that as many soldiers as possible could vote.</p>
                <p>Williams concludes his meditations on the life, leadership, and legacy of Lincoln with an essay on
                    "Lincoln Collecting," written with Mark Neely, Jr. After the middle of the twentieth century, they
                    write, collecting became more of an investment than a scholarly, literary, or cultural activity. In
                    response to this division, Williams and Neely wisely conclude that it would have been better "if
                    Lincoln collecting turned its back on the notion of investment in historical materials and embraced
                    the more enduring values of scholarship and culture" (p. 177).</p>
                <p>These three jurists examine Lincoln through the lens of their legal training and experience. While
                    Fletcher argues that Lincoln consciously or inadvertently created a new constitutional order through
                    his rhetoric and leadership, Farber and Williams find his performance on constitutional matters
                    under exceptionally trying circumstances to be restrained by good judgment and the rule of law.
                    While all three scholars draw inspiration and lessons for today from Lincoln's life, they disagree
                    over what those lessons are. Fletcher welcomes the relentless pursuit of equality and democracy
                    regardless of what Lincoln thought of these ideas; Farber and Williams find instructive lessons in
                    leadership styles, presidential power, and integrity within Lincoln's efforts to preserve the Union.
                    Each of the authors offers fresh ideas about the relevance of Lincoln's ideas, words, and actions
                    for the world today.</p>

                <p>One of the most positive aspects of the deluge of Civil War literature produced in the past decade
                    has been the publication of primary sources. Onceforgotten documents have been rediscovered, new
                    troves of information have been found, and our ability to understand the people who lived through
                    the nation's greatest crisis has been enhanced. These two editions of Civil War letters continue the
                    fine tradition of publishing such materials, and they do so in ways that not only provide easier
                    access to the words and thoughts of historical actors but also offer analysis of broader themes and
                    subjects of inquiry.</p>

                    throughout the volume guides the reader through the war years.</p>

                    </placeName> lawyer Alvin C. Voris was an abolitionist and advocate for women's rights, radical
                    positions that stemmed from his Christian faith and education at Oberlin College. A staunch
                    Republican legislator, Voris was also an idealist who sponsored reform legislation aimed to promote
                    temperance, improve prisons, and provide more funding for schools and insane asylums. He carried
                    these idealistic notions with him into the war, where he found the reality of combat quite unlike
                    the glorious fight for righteousness he had imagined.</p>
                <p>Enlisting as a private in September 1861, his political standing brought him promotion to brevet
                    major general in the course of the war as he proved his mettle by bravely leading Union troops in
                    battles from the Shenandoah Valley to the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Although his idealism was tempered by the horrors of war, the typical squabbling
                    between officers and men, and his longing to return home to his wife, Lydia, Voris still believed in
                    the cause for which he fought.</p>
                <p>Voris's wartime experience only deepened his support of African American rights. In addition to
                    meeting <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-101-1-083"/> slaves while in the South, he served with black
                    troops-his unit followed the 54th <placeName>

                    </placeName> into battle at Fort Wagner-and later Voris temporarily commanded African American
                    soldiers. Unlike many others, he refused to forget the service of blacks in the war and would often
                    refer to their exploits in public speeches. His letters throughout the conflict also reflected his
                    views on women, as he treated Lydia as a partner, his intellectual equal. After the war, he
                    continued to fight for equality and reform in his role as a judge and a community leader.</p>

                <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Vermilion grew up in Indiana, where he was educated at Asbury College (later DePauw
                    University). He moved first to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> to practice medicine, then to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, where in 1858 he married Mary Kemper, a young lady he had met in Indiana. A Republican
                    who loyally supported Lincoln, Vermilion enlisted in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> Infantry in 1862, raised a company of men, and led them into battle, seeing action in a

                    </placeName> Valley, including the siege of Vicksburg. Like many other officers, Vermilion was an
                    astute observer of camp life and the countryside, and an insightful commentator on the war. His
                    letters included everything from critical remarks about the soldiersâ€™ fondness for whiskey, to
                    financial advice for his wife at home, to accounts of battles, to comments on the cause and the
                    nature of war.</p>
                <p>More rare and extraordinary are the letters of Mary to William. She spent many months living with
                    family in Indiana while her husband was away and later returned home to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>. Her letters were supportive, but also filled with family problems and comments about
                    the political situation on the home front. Here we find firsthand accounts of the antiwar
                    Copperheads, disheartening complaints about Democratic relatives, worries about finances, and
                    concerns about the everyday matters of life as well as the war. Through it all, William and Mary
                    passionately conveyed their feelings for one another and supported each other through the crisis via
                    their correspondence. Mary proved herself a strong, intelligent woman; she invested wisely in real
                    estate, the profits from which laid a foundation for their fortune after the war. Upon his return
                    home, William became a lawyer, established a successful practice, and went into politics and
                    business. In later years, he made speeches as a leader of a veteran's group and in one entitled "The
                    Ladies-The Soldiersâ€™ Best Friends," he offered a fitting tribute to his own wife and her remarkable
                    work during the war.</p>
                <p>These two books, then, are valuable additions to the Civil War scholar's shelf. Mushkat and Elder
                    connect the correspondence to recent scholarship, making their introductions <pb n="78"

                    scholarly editing. These are also important contributions to the history of the Midwest, as both the
                    Voris and Vermilion families illustrate middle-class lives in a time of crisis. For military
                    historians interested in lower-level officers, social historians analyzing family, race, and gender
                    relations, and regional historians looking at particular states, these two editions will be
                    significant sources of evidence; and they are also interesting to read.</p>

                <p>In a book that provides all the benefits of an insider's account and contains all the disadvantages
                    of being a personal recollection, former State Senator Lawrence M. Borst writes with three clear
                    objectives in mind. First, he tells the story of the formation and early years of the Republican
                    Action Committee of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County, an organization that emerged under the leadership of Keith Bulen as one of the
                    very few urban political machines in the latter half of the 20th century. Borst describes the
                    strategies used by Bulen and his allies to expand their power, and he provides valuable details
                    about the methods used to construct a Republican machine that eventually won control of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Next, he sets the record straight as to how Unigov was conceived, planned, and
                    implemented. His account clarifies several points about the origins of Unigov, including who coined
                    the name (Buert SerVaas) and the role that Keith Bulen played in designing the new government (very
                    little). Finally, Borst writes to tell the story of a friend, Indianapolis attorney Ed Lewis, "a
                    funny, shrewd man with all kinds of talents" (p. 8). To this third purpose, Borst provides some
                    interesting vignettes, but his anecdotes fail to provide authoritative documentation of the many
                    roles Lewis played behind the scenes in politics and government.</p>
                <p>The promise of this book lay in the number of key events and public policies over the past four
                    decades that might have been illuminated. Borst, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was a
                    leading figure in framing the biennial state budgets and was the main architect of Indiana's tax
                    structure. He mentions that he was a conferee on every state budget since 1971. Unfortunately, <pb
                        n="79" id="VAA4025-101-1-085"/> he provides little coverage of these items. He barely mentions
                    public education, with the exception of higher education and kindergarten, but it was usually
                    education funding that derailed the legislative sessions and caused governors to call special
                    sessions. He does provide some valuable details on the issue of gambling, including the legislative
                    fights on the lottery, pari-mutuel betting, and riverboat casinos. He presents his version of the
                    overhaul of the tax structure during the special session of 2002, but his story omits much of the
                    reasoning put forward by others that also became part of the package. He also recollects events
                    surrounding the passage of Governor Otis Bowen's tax package of 1973, but his brief mention contains
                    only anecdotes and fails to add anything new for the historical record.</p>
                <p>A memoir is self-selected and, for the most part, self-serving, by definition. This book is no
                    exception. Although it adds little substance, it does contain some valuable anecdotal insights into
                    the way the Indiana legislature operates and the reader is able to extract some lessons that advance
                    our understanding of the legislative process. The book lacks a consistent theme-something a watchful
                    editor could have provided-and an index would have been useful.</p>
                <p>As Lawrence Borst is leaving the legislature, the book title seems appropriate. Yet its origin is
                    rather surprising. Borst explains that while in a Las Vegas casino, he saw a welldressed man "with a
                    gorgeous blonde on his arm" who approached the craps table and promptly lost $30,000 (p. 237). The
                    gambler stepped back from the table, took two chips from his pocket, flipped them in the air and
                    onto the table and said, "Gentlemen, it has been my pleasure." Borst writes that he had never been
                    so impressed and that he wanted to have the phrase "engraved on my tombstone. I thought, too, that
                    it would make a good title for a book" (p. 238).</p>

                <p>Cahokia Mounds is the premier American Indian center in eastern North dred America. Within its
                    five-square-mile area were built more than one hundred earthen mounds, including Monks Mound, the
                    largest in the New <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-101-1-086"/> World. Today the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> maintains nearly two thousand acres of this site as the Cahokia Mounds State Historic
                    Site. Also designated a National Historic Landmark and a United Nations World Heritage Site, Cahokia
                    is truly an American and world treasure that needs to be protected and preserved for future
                    generations.</p>
                <p>Over the past forty years archaeologists have attempted to unravel some of this center's meaning,
                    with over a dozen works on the site published in the last decade alone. The authors of this volume
                    bring to the topic nearly two decades of investigative experience at the site and its surrounding
                    region. The volume consists of three sections-each with multiple chapters, an introduction, and a
                    conclusion-all in the service of documenting the relationship between Cahokia's residents and their
                    physical surroundings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">Envisioning Cahokia's</hi> landscapebased perspective aims, in the authorsâ€™ words, to
                    "provide a less static interpretation of the past" than archaeologists customarily employ (p. 40).
                    In the first chapter, the authors unpack the concept of landscape and its many dimensions,
                    challenging the reader to go beyond a static temporal and spatial framework and consider a fluid and
                    dynamic perspective of the site. Thus, according to the authors, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
                    Euro-Americans found a site that was actually the end product of over four hundred years of shaping
                    and reshaping the natural and cultural landscape. More significantly, although Cahokia is considered
                    a Mississippian center (with its period of greatest activity spanning from AD 1000-1400), the
                    authors demonstrate that its foundation lies in the earlier Emergent Mississippian period, when
                    initial work began on Monks Mound and on the adjacent Grand Plaza, at forty acres one of the largest
                    public spaces in the New World. The discovery of this massive earthmoving and leveling activity
                    constitutes one of the most important contributions of this group of scholars.</p>
                <p>As a researcher working at Cahokia, it is easy to take issue with the details and with some of the
                    authorsâ€™ interpretations. In their final section, "Landscape and Meaning," they tend to draw modern
                    parallels, referring to the original shapers of this landscape as architects, surveyors, and
                    engineers, and avoiding the use of American Indian perspectives that might have revealed a different
                    relationship with the natural world.</p>
                <p>In the end the authors provide an important addition to the growing stack of works on Cahokia; theirs
                    is a useful contribution and foundation that others will continue to build upon. I recommend this
                    book to any student of eastern North American archaeology and to those interested in the
                    relationship that all peoples have with the land as they shape and reshape the landscape.</p>

                <p>In their classic work, <hi rend="i">Cherokee Dance and Drama</hi> (1951), anthropologists Frank Speck
                    and Leonard Broom documented an eastern Cherokee tradition known as the Booger dance. Boogers were
                    men wearing grotesquely humorous masks who interrupted gatherings at Cherokee houses and broke the
                    rules of Cherokee etiquette. They tried to pick fights and made obscene gestures toward women. They
                    spoke in ugly growls and acted unpredictably. They tried to dance like Cherokees, but their
                    movements were awkward and unseemly. The Boogers were more than rule-breakers. They represented
                    outsiders, with many of the masks offering misshapen versions of white men's faces. The dance, then,
                    not only illustrated the difference between proper and improper social behavior, but offered a
                    commentary on European conquest and on the Cherokeesâ€™ relations with their unwelcome neighbors. The
                    Booger dance was, in other words, a form of history telling.</p>
                <p>Peter Nabokov's <hi rend="i">A Forest of Time</hi> describes and examines a broad collection of such
                    American Indian "history ways." Drawing material from many different fields of scholarship, as well
                    as from his own research and experience, Nabokov searches for what he terms the fundamental
                    principles underlying most or all Native American expressions of history. His purpose is not simply
                    to argue that Indian stories can complement western-style histories, but to demonstrate that there
                    are distinct Indian forms of historical consciousness. These must be understood, he believes, if one
                    is to comprehend Native cultures and the American Indian experience.</p>
                <p>Native history ways, Nabokov emphasizes, reside in sources that academic historians tend to ignore or
                    underutilize: performance traditions, religious rituals, material objects worked by Indian hands,
                    place names, stories generally categorized as myths or folktales, and narratives of individual
                    encounters with the supernatural. While many of these sources appear to operate within a timeless,
                    mythic past, Nabokov points out that the stories themselves change over time in ways that one can
                    document using anthropological studies, travelersâ€™ narratives, and folklore collections. Those
                    changes, he suggests, can in turn be correlated with historical events and developments. For
                    instance, scholars collected a vast number of trickster stories, some old and some apparently new,
                    in one of the most desperate eras of American Indian history, the period around the turn of the
                    twentieth century. Perhaps, Nabokov suggests, one can find in the flourishing of the trickster tale
                        <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-101-1-088"/> a Native response to the suffering experienced in the
                    reservation era, with Indian people using the trickster to examine their condition and find ways to
                    survive. Tracing the changes in the stories one can document an ongoing Native American analysis of
                    colonial domination. What is particularly attractive about this idea is that one can start the
                    investigation with Native texts and Native cultural categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">A Forest of Time</hi> represents Nabokov's effort to synthesize decades of reading in
                    multiple disciplines. The breadth of his source material alone makes the book highly valuable. In a
                    sense, Nabokov has created a body of literature, since he has brought heretofore scattered works
                    into conversation with one another. That is a significant feat, but the book is even more important
                    as a call for future scholarship. If this reviewer's experience is any indication, researchers in
                    Native American history will come away from <hi rend="i">A Forest of Time</hi> with ideas for
                    starting new projects and refining old ones. Those in American history, meanwhile, should be
                    inspired to bring Indian perspectives into their treatments of other peoplesâ€™ pasts. With grace and
                    imagination, Nabokov reminds us how much Native American cultures can contribute to our
                    understanding of life on this continent.</p>

                <p>Environmental historian Ted Steinberg concludes his <hi rend="i">Down to Earth</hi> with a warning:
                    "When it comes to the human control of nature, beware: Things rarely turn out the way they are
                    supposed to. The wind shifts, the earth moves, and now and again, when you least expect it, a flock
                    of birds swoops in for a meal" (p. 347). Those few lines summarize Steinberg's argument that a full
                    understanding of American history requires that we portray nature as an active player and not simply
                    as a backdrop in the evolution of human society over time. Social historians argue for writing
                    history from the bottom up; Steinberg contends that history also needs to be written "from the
                    ground up."</p>
                <p>Writing history in this way, Steinberg explains, demands that historians rethink the time periods
                    that they use to organize and interpret the past. From this perspective, three turning points mark
                    the history of America. First, with more than a nod to the <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-101-1-089"/> work
                    of Alfred Crosby, Steinberg argues that European arrival in North America precipitated a profound
                    ecological transformation, as two continents isolated for millions of years were suddenly
                    "reconnected." Europeans began an ongoing, accelerating process of moving and mixing plants,
                    animals, and micro-organisms around the world, with profound consequences for both natural and human
                    history. Steinbergs second major turning point is the rectangular survey promulgated by the Land
                    Ordinance of 1785. "The grid," he argues, "was to the rationalization of nature what the Declaration
                    of Independence was to freedom" (p. x). The final transition comes with the rise of consumerism in
                    the late <hi rend="i">nineteenth</hi> century. Commodification of nature, Steinberg concludes, was
                    the single most significant force in shaping and reshaping the natural world.</p>
                <p>Steinberg organizes <hi rend="i">Down to Earth</hi> around these turning points. Part I, "Chaos to
                    Simplicity," addresses Native Americans and their environment and the dramatic transformations
                    following European contact. Part II, "Rationalization and Its Discontents," examines the century
                    after 1790 with a focus on land, agriculture, and resource extraction. Part III, "Consuming Nature,"
                    considers the environmental consequences of the development of a modern consumer culture in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. An accomplished and insightful historian and the author of several previous monographs
                    on American environmental history, Steinberg skillfully draws upon his own work and an impressive
                    body of related literature to offer a useful overview of the historical interplay between people and
                    their surroundings. The careful citations and an extensive bibliography will prove quite helpful,
                    the index is well organized and useful, and ample illustrations reinforce the text.</p>
                <p>While it would be possible to debate the fine points of the author's interpretation, Down to Earth
                    offers a well-written, interesting, and insightful examination of American history "from the ground
                    up." Steinberg is an excellent scholar who also knows how to tell a good story. <hi rend="i">Down to
                        Earth</hi> offers a good read for anyone <hi rend="i">interested</hi> in an overview of American
                    environmental history, and it should also work quite well in a variety of history and environmental
                    studies-related classes.</p>

                    <hi rend="i">At the Edge of Empire</hi> offers students of British North America an ambitious and
                    well-written synthesis of "the territory that lay beyond the core settlements of mainland English

                    </placeName> frontier. <hi rend="i">At the Edge of Empire</hi> makes sense of these varied locales,
                    reminding us to recognize particulars of time and place while not losing sight of the broader
                    patterns that characterized British colonization.</p>
                <p>Hinderaker and Mancall bring together their understanding of the multiple regions of colonial America
                    to identify many shared traits of the various British North American backcountries. First, they show
                    that success was elusive for backcountry immigrants because of incessant struggles with both Native
                    Americans and eastern elites, both of whom made it difficult for settlers to secure title to the
                    land. Consequently, backcountry settlers generally believed that justice was elusive, a sentiment by
                    Bacon's Rebellion, the Paxton Boys, and the Regulator movement. Such periodic spasms of violence in
                    the backcountry fostered stereotypes of lawlessness and irreligious behavior in the region that cut
                    across nearly three centuries of British colonization. But most importantly, the British emphasis on
                    settlement made a lasting impression on American identity. Access to and ownership of western lands
                    became a guiding principle of American nationalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="i">At the Edge of Empire</hi> is organized around the competing and sometimes shared
                    interests of Native Americans, backcountry settlers, and the eastern elites and British officials
                    who tried to manage their affairs. The authors explore the distinctive cultures, economies, and
                    governments of the thirteen colonies, both as they affected each colony's relations to regional
                    tribes and as they fit into the wider legal and diplomatic structure of the British Empire.</p>
                <p>Readers will also appreciate Hinderaker and Mancall's rich analysis of Native Americans in the
                    British backcountry. Struggles over land, rather than disputes about trade or access to labor,
                    typically determined when and under what circumstances violence occurred. Indian-English alliances,
                    built around trade and mutual protection, <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-101-1-091"/> eventually succumbed
                    to violence as settlers advanced inexorably on Native Americans debilitated by disease and economic
                    dependency. The authors address the root causes of these violent confrontations in competing
                    philosophies regarding the land.</p>
                <p>Throughout <hi rend="i">At the Edge of Empire,</hi> the authors make an implicit argument about
                    British North American history: that the British did not plan on destroying tribes with Old World
                    diseases anymore than George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> set out to become an American through his actions at Fort Necessity, at the dawn of the
                    French and Indian War. Too many historians, in their view, read conspiracies into events that
                    resulted from the haphazard mingling of people over time. While deep-seated cultural and economic
                    goals informed both alliances and conflicts between British colonists and Native Americans, these
                    outcomes were not part of a coordinated three-hundred-year plan scripted by British colonizers.</p>
                <p>This narrative synthesis of the advancing British Empire is interrupted by brief but involved
                    explorations of specific wars, communities, and regions. The structure of <hi rend="i">At the Edge
                        of Empire</hi> advances Hinderaker and Mancall's goal of illustrating both the unity and the
                    diversity of British North America. Students and general readers will appreciate this highly
                    readable synthesis of the backcountrya moving region that was, in many ways, at the center of the
                    British Empire.</p>

                <p>Any scholar who studies Native American history, the American West, or Indian-White relations prior
                    to 1850 will find few surprises in this book. Nonetheless, they should take note of it. R. Douglas
                    Hurt, a prolific author and chair of the history department at Purdue University, has taken it upon
                    himself to produce a concise one-volume overview of nine distinct but overlapping frontier regions
                    over eight extremely complicated decades. Major players in his broad survey include civil,
                    religious, and military figures of Spanish, French, English, and American origins. Central also are
                    leaders and members of the Iroquois, Shawnee, Sauk, Cherokee, Comanche, Chickasaw, Mesquakie,
                    Seminole, Dakota, Ute and numerous other Indian <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-101-1-092"/> nations. With
                    such an immense cast of characters, multiple and evershifting frontier regions, continual changes
                    over time, and no central narrative to hold all of his disparate parts together, Hurt's project
                    seems destined to fail. Yet, somehow, it doesn't.</p>
                <p>Like most authors writing in the wake of Richard White's <hi rend="i">The Middle Ground</hi> (1991),
                    Hurt presents readers with a frontier that is a far cry from Frederick Jackson Turner's stark
                    dividing line between "civilization" and "savagery." Instead, Hurt writes of "zones of
                    encounter"-regions shaped by intercultural interaction and negotiation. These negotiations, he
                    points out, changed every group involved in them, "sometimes quickly, usually slowly, but
                    nonetheless decisively" (p. xv). No less than their European counterparts, Native people developed
                    strategies for dealing with changing circumstances and were never passive victims. As Hurt tells it,
                    the history of the regions that eventually became parts of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is not always about conquest, rarely possessed a pre-ordained outcome, and was not even
                    always driven by European or American interests.</p>
                <p>None of this is original-or, by now, even surprising. Dozens of monographs have been written on this
                    subject for each of the regions and periods that Hurt describes; his impressive bibliography lists a
                    sizable portion of them and will serve as a valuable reading list for those readers who wish to
                    pursue the subject (or a particular aspect of it) in greater detail.</p>
                <p>Originality is not always the best indicator of a book's value. In completing this work of historical
                    synthesis, Hurt has provided a service to a variety of audiences. For those who teach classes in
                    U.S. history that cover the period prior to the mid-nineteenth century, he has presented smoothly
                    written chapters that provide a great deal of information and are easily comprehensible to
                    undergraduates. For graduate students preparing for qualifying exams in related fields or taking a
                    course outside their area of specialization, Hurt has provided an excellent overview, as well as
                    thorough documentation and an extensive reading list. Most importantly, though, he has provided a
                    history of Indian-White relations for general readers that emphasizes conflict but is not really
                    about warfare. Nor does it dwell on a particular region or narrow time period at the expense of all
                    others. In effect, Hurt has adopted a comparative approach to frontier studies, summed up a decade
                    of scholarship, and packaged the result for popular consumption.</p>
                <p>Too often, academics write only for other academics. With <hi rend="i">The Indian Frontier,</hi> Hurt
                    has demonstrated that complex ideas and situations can be conveyed to non-specialists without
                    sacrificing their complexity or their richness. Moreover, Hurt makes it look deceptively easy. One
                    can only hope that readers of all stripes will appreciate his efforts.</p>

                <p>Almost thirty years ago, in The <hi rend="i">Gun in America</hi> (1975), Lee Kennett and James
                    Anderson concluded that "time works against the gun" (p. 255). Yet, since this prediction, debates
                    over the Second Amendment have only continued, heating with time. Now enters David Williams, John S.
                    Hastings Professor of Law at Indiana University School of Law, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who proposes to reduce the heat by constructing a new myth for these new times. An
                    early participant in the most recent wave of polemical battles, Williams uses this book to solidify
                    his arguments, while answering friends and critics-particularly Gary Wills, Saul Cornell, Robert
                    Cover, and Sanford Levinson-and dismissing by silence those who composed the friendly brief in U.S.
                    v <hi rend="i">Emerson</hi> (2001).</p>
                <p>The book is divided into three parts: the first is a foray into the period of the founding; the
                    second, a survey of the complex present understandings of myths and political violence; the third, a
                    proposed remedy for the current confusions over the meaning and significance of the Second Amendment
                    and, by implication, a prescription for judicial action. Here Williams concludes that as
                    "disciplining violence is the first task of constitutional order, it is also the first duty of
                    citizenship" (p. 313).</p>
                <p>Williams's historical vision is inextricably intertwined with his idealism. His reading of the Second
                    Amendment leads him to assert that "the right to bear arms belongs to the Body of the People, which
                    is a <hi rend="i">sui generis</hi> element of eighteenth-century theory: the citizenry as a
                    collectivity organized into a universal militia and unified by a common culture" (p. 70). Of course,
                    such a vision of society did not survive the rapid growth and change of the nineteenth century,
                    although the author includes little discussion of its erosion over time.</p>
                <p>Williams states his thesis most clearly in the final section of the book. Here, he makes a plea for
                    "restructuring" the Second Amendment by creating a new American unity built upon "the revival of a
                    common life," and prescribes the construction of a new "myth" of "civic trust" (pp. 320, <pb n="88"
                        id="VAA4025-101-1-094"/> 322). The author's vision for this new unity rests upon a number of
                    assumed historical constructs, most of which are debatable.</p>
                <p>Many of Williams's readers will question whether the framers "gave" rights. This modern understanding
                    of the state as a cornucopia of rights-giving is antithetical to much of the eighteenth-century
                    literature regarding natural rights. Instead, the founding fathers spoke of the government of the
                    self (which necessarily included a bundle of rights that was the birthright of all), a concept
                    popularized in Thomas Paine's <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi> and then formally asserted in the
                    Declaration of Independence and codified in the constitutional imperative that "to secure these
                    rights, governments are instituted among men."</p>
                <p>Williams's treatment of the Second Amendment itself is equally problematic. He views the amendment as
                    unique, even as he notes and discusses the significance of Article One, Section Eight, with its
                    enumeration of the Congress's power to raise and arm a militia. In contrast, many historians have
                    viewed the Second Amendment in the broader context of the entire Bill of Rights.</p>
                <p>Finally, this work raises but does not entirely answer the question of the importance of federalism,
                    both at the founding and since that time. Because Williams pays little attention to the Articles and
                    argues against the "statesâ€™ rights" defense of the Second Amendment, he overlooks a critical chapter
                    in the history of American citizenship. In contrast, James Kettner in <hi rend="i">The Development
                        of American Citizenship</hi> (1978) emphasized statebased volitional allegiance as the original
                    understanding of American citizenship, and an indispensable aspect of eighteenth-century theory of
                    the government of the self.</p>
                <p>Nagging details pile up throughout the book, subtracting from its presentation. Williams gives too
                    little careful attention to <hi rend="i">U.S. v Miller</hi> (1939) and the recent decisions of the
                    U.S. Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts. He inexplicably relies upon the discredited work of Michael
                    Bellesiles while several documentary collections (among them, histories of ratification and of the
                    first federal congress, including the 1991 collection <hi rend="i">Creating the Bill of Rights)</hi>
                    go uncited and presumably unused. Herbert Storing's editorial and monographic work on the
                    anti-federalists is nowhere to be seen. Finally, a careful reading of the book's notes raises
                    questions as to the work of Williams's own editors. The inconsistencies of citation and other lapses
                    (which include mention of James <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    arguments of this book.</p>

                    </placeName> Territory for about four years, reveals as much about herself as an eastern woman,
                    steeped in the ideology of domesticity but troubled by inequities in patriarchal society, as she
                    does about the nature of early nineteenth-century <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
                <p>John Hallwas's introduction offers salient background on Farnham's postIllinois career as a writer
                    and reformer influenced by Transcendentalism, spiritualism, and ideas of female moral superiority.
                    Hallwas also illustrates Farnham's method of setting up contrasts between nature as a beneficent
                    garden and as a dangerous force, and between antithetical forms of human behavior. This useful
                    introduction, however, was not revised for the 2003 edition and thus is not informed by recent
                    scholarship on rural, women's, gender, or reform history.</p>
                <p>Eliza Farnham, an opinionated observer, did not hesitate to mock some of those she
                    encounteredespecially "Kaintuckians" and "Hooshiers." She presented dichotomous views of her sister
                    Mary, a refined New Yorker and civilizer, and Mary's neighbor from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> whose family lived in squalor because of the "incapacity of the mistress of this family
                    to appreciate a better condition, or help to create one" (p. 39). Women could either elevate
                    societytheir ascribed role-or they could degenerate in response to the harsh conditions.</p>
                <p>Those interested in Indiana lore will relish Farnham's hilarious conversations with a "red-flanneled
                    Hooshier." Despite her depiction of an insensitive, chauvinistic lout, one detects in the Hoosier's
                    remarks about his new wife the same practicality and pragmatism evident in letters and diaries of
                    nineteenth-century Indiana farmers. Accused by Farnham of trapping his wife like a bird in a cage,
                    the Hoosier replies that he "shouldn't make much account of havinâ€™ a bird in my cabin, but a good
                    stout woman I should calculate was worth something. She can pay her way, and do a handsome thing
                    besides, helpinâ€™ me on the farm" (p. 19). Farnham's efforts to enlighten him about treatment of
                    women in "our country" are unavailing. Remarking that Yankees can treat women as they choose, he
                    explains that he does not "think a woman's of much account anyhow, if she can't help herself a
                    little and me too. If the Yankee woman was <hi rend="i">raised up like the women here aar,</hi>
                    they'd cost a heap less and be worth more" (p. 22).</p>
                <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-101-1-096"/>
                <p>As she travels around the region, Farnham describes nature's glorious abundance as well as its
                    destructive power; she ruminates on "the fraudulent precipitancy" with which settlers have sealed
                    the fate of the area's Native Americans; and she explains her understanding of the reciprocity
                    between the land and the people (p. 226). Death is a frequent presence in Farnham's account; during
                    a twoweek period in the summer of 1838, Farnham lost her sister and firstborn child. Few accounts of
                    children's deaths in nineteenth-century sources are rendered with as much emotional intensity.
                    Elsewhere a father, absent to buy provisions, returns to find his home burned; encountering
                    "perishing children, an infant corpse, a dying wife," he can only "curseâ€¦ the treacherous beauty
                    that invited him there" (p. 184).</p>
                <p>Despite such vivid glimpses of the harsh realities of prairie life, Farnham leaves little doubt about
                    what she considers to be nature's ultimate "plan": prairie settlement, she proclaims, will reveal
                    how "great, and good, and strong, is man when left to govern himself; free from want, from
                    oppression, from ignorance, from fear!" (p. 268).</p>

                <p>The rise of the pseudoscience of eugenics and the sociopolitical use of its unproven theories form
                    one of the darkest chapters in medical history. Edwin Black extensively reviews archival materials
                    to document the connections between eugenics in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and the work of the German Nazis. He argues that flawed American research in the first
                    three decades of the twentieth century provided an apparently rational cover for Hitler's deranged
                    plans, and explores, in the last two chapters, how the findings of modern genetics might well be
                    misused today.</p>
                <p>Eugenics in America combined a distortion of nineteenth-century scientific discoveries with the
                    misinterpretation of sociological trends at the turn of the twentieth century. Darwin's theories
                    opened new vistas on the natural world, biomedical and psychological research advanced, and Mendel's
                    work defining inheritance of simple traits in plants was rediscovered <pb n="91"
                        id="VAA4025-101-1-097"/> after fifty years. For many Progressive Era scientists and social
                    theorists, the possibility for human improvement seemed limitless.</p>
                <p>Francis Gal ton, a cousin of Darwin who was interested in animal breeding and in statistical
                    measurement of human populations, invented the term eugenics. He combined Darwinian natural
                    selection and the concept of inherited traits to promote the idea of positive eugenics, with the
                    implication that his own advantaged class should intermarry and produce superior progeny to improve
                    the human race. Galton did note, however, that eugenics was not yet scientifically provable.</p>
                <p>Many Americans distorted Galton's views into a negative eugenics that promulgated prevention of
                    reproduction by the so-called inferior classes: the poor, the severely mentally ill, the
                    intellectually disadvantaged, convicts, and recent immigrants not of the "Nordic race," i.e., the
                    weak and powerless. Tragically, many respected American physicians, scientists, academics, and
                    philanthropists bought into this notion. In order to document the connection between <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1930s and American eugenicists, Black focuses on these eugenicists rather than
                    on those who opposed them.</p>
                <p>Indiana contributed its share of this group. Dr. Harry Clay Sharp began performing extralegal medical
                    castration of males at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Reformatory in the late 1890s as a cure for excessive masturbation. He later accepted
                    ideas appearing in the medical literature at the time that vasectomy of convicts would prevent the
                    propagation of a criminal class, and he became the world expert in the three-minute procedure, which
                    used no anesthesia. Reverend Oscar McCulloch, a leading reformer and advocate of public charity from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, twisted sociological studies calling for social reform into a fervid belief in
                    hereditary determinism uninfluenced by environmental factors. He performed genealogical
                    investigation of a "degenerate" family, the Tribe of Ishmael, though his conclusions have not been
                    substantiated by reexamination of his pseudoscientific data. Former Indiana University President

                    (1902), which Black quotes as arguing, "The pauper is the victim of heredity but neither Nature nor
                    Society recognizes that as an excuse for his existence." Dr. J. N. Hurty, secretary of the Indiana
                    State Board of Health and later president of the American Public Health Association, lobbied the
                    Indiana legislature to pass a law legalizing involuntary sterilization. His attempts repeatedly
                    failed until 1907 when Sharp pressured Governor J. Frank Hanly, and the legislature finally passed
                    the law making Indiana the first jurisdiction in the world to legislate involuntary sterilization of
                    mentally impaired patients, poorhouse residents, and prisoners.</p>
                <p>Although much has been written about involuntary sterilization in <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-101-1-098"/>
                    America, Edwin Black's investigation into the background of eugenics and the people who vigorously
                    promoted it is among the most thoroughly researched studies to date. His presentation is balanced;
                    the story it tells is fascinating-and frightening.</p>

                <p>For nearly a century, working people -ordinary men and women-have been frequent subjects in one of
                    the most powerful forms of mass culture: the American film. In <hi rend="i">Blue-Collar
                    Hollywood,</hi> historian John Bodnar presents an important investigation and critique of
                    characterizations of working people in "the movies," and of the way in which film-making interacts
                    with American political and social traditions.</p>
                <p>Bodnar brings his understanding of political, social, and cinematic history to bear on a number of
                    significant films, arranged by era from the 1930s to the 1990s, including <hi rend="i">The Grapes of
                        Wrath, Pride of the Marines, A Street Car Named Desire, A Raisin in the Sun, Raging Bull, and
                        Norma Rae.</hi> As intriguing as the author's investigation into the characters populating the
                    movies themselves is his history of the development of American political culture over sixty years,
                    and of how that culture, in turn, shaped the nature of the film industry and its product. Bodnar
                    demonstrates a superb grasp of relevant political theory as well as current historiography to
                    underpin his analysis of the movies. His interpretation of the role of the family in <hi rend="i"
                        >The Grapes of Wrath,</hi> for example, includes a presentation of the essential film narrative
                    and analysis of character roles, a sense of the production issues and decisions that affected the
                    resulting film, an examination of the political and social cultures of the era and their
                    relationships with the film, a review of public and governmental engagement with the film, and
                    finally, his analysis of the interplay among these variables.</p>
                <p>The main theoretical thrust of Bodnar's book lies in his interest in the relationship between
                    Hollywood's portrayal of working people and the power of two principal (and often competing)
                    American political traditions: liberalism and democracy. As such, the work addresses a wide range of
                    social and political issues, such as <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-101-1-099"/> the roles of family and
                    women, race, social and economic class, the impact of war and McCarthyism, civil rights, poverty,
                    and much more. Bodnar concludes that, like American society at large, movie images of ordinary
                    people were never constant: their values and principles evolved within, and were reflective of, the
                    fluidity and evolution of political culture.</p>
                <p>Criticism of this work is largely a matter of interpretation, rather than of factual disagreement. It
                    is by nature a theoretical and critical study, and a selective one at that. The range of films
                    investigated is small compared to the universe of movie production over the past six decades. The
                    author does not claim comprehensiveness-an impossible task-but one could debate Bodnar's selection
                    of films for review. For example, a full discussion of film noir would have been appropriate for
                    this work. A truly American genre with a tremendous impact upon movie making, film noir explored
                    working-class issues of postwar disillusionment, urban malaise, crime, labor, and the fundamental
                    economic and social failings of liberalism and democracy. And scholars could, of course, debate the
                    author's particular interpretations of recent political writings and history.</p>
                <p>Such criticisms will not, however, detract from the conclusion that Bodnar has written a fine book.
                    It is a significant work and should be read by those who seek insight into the role of the film
                    industry in mass culture, its interaction with politics and society at large, and its portrayal of
                    the majority of people living in the <placeName>

                <p>Recent political debates have focused on the power and function of the public and private economic
                    sectors in determining land use in our suburban nation. The traditional public role in the
                    development process-of providing public infrastructure and public spaces-has been transformed under
                    the banner of fiscal conservatism and as a reaction to unwanted sprawl. Additionally, fear of crime
                    and of the erosion of property values has promoted the insularity and antiurbanism manifest in the
                    proliferation <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-101-1-100"/> of "gated communities." <hi rend="i">Behind the
                        Gates</hi> abstracts the debate over this trend, demonstrating the folly of the "gated"
                    lifestyle through the analytical insights of an environmental psychologist.</p>
                <p>Setha Low, a professor of anthropology and environmental psychology, interviewed householders in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City, Long Island, and San Antonio. Bridging the anthropologist's role as a neutral
                    observer with the behavioral scientist's focus on environmental interaction, she examines the
                    psychological dimension of her subjectsâ€™ actions in both demanding and responding to this built
                    environment.</p>
                <p>Low's findings are highly critical of the residents of modern gated communities. As a rule, she finds
                    that they shun pluralism and pursue homogeneity as a way of protecting a lifestyle. Underlying this
                    lifestyle is a racism not unlike the anti-Semitism Low experienced growing up in West <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Theirs is also a nostalgic movement, as these baby boom buyers, in their peak earning
                    years, seek the sense of protection they recall from the pre-Levittown neighborhoods of their
                    childhood.</p>
                <p>Yet the "security" of gated communities is belied by the fact that the "gate" provides no greater
                    measure of safety than other forms of suburbia. Furthermore, it comes at a cost to basic rights.
                    Condominium and homeownersâ€™ associations act as private, local governments, collecting taxes in the
                    form of mandatory fees and supplying the civic goods of protection and the amenities of land uses,
                    utilities, and services. Such associations represent a step away from democracy and toward
                    feudalism; they place the power in "freeholders" who, as economist Charles Tiebout characterizes,
                    may all vote with their feet.</p>
                <p>Low, the psychologist, concludes that emotion, not reason, is the prime motivation for accepting such
                    a cost. Beyond a small note to history in chapter one, Low is not a historian; she misses a chance
                    to point out the deep roots of this privatization of planning in the evolution from Ebenezer
                    Howard's early <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Instead, she draws on such recent work as Mike Davis's study of ethnic spatial
                    segregation and the marginalization of the poor in <placeName>

                        rend="i">Fortress America</hi> (1997), a more direct study of the gated phenomenon.</p>
                <p>To this discussion Low brings insightful observation, based largely on the survey, and impressive
                    empiricism and analysis. Low's position in the debate over gated communities is apparent. Taking
                    issue both with neoclassical economists, such as Tiebout, and with production homebuilders who favor
                    gates, she remains committed to a land-use policy rooted in democratic pluralism. This book's
                    combination of style, scholarship, and <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-101-1-101"/> significance commands
                    attention from the academic and civic communities.</p>

                <p>In this sweeping, provocative book, George Fredrickson explores the development of racism and
                    anti-Semitism from the Middle Ages to the present. For Fredrickson, the term racism has become so
                    "loaded and ambiguous" that he has taken it as his duty to historicize the term, to explain the way
                    people have thought about race and used it to construct social and cultural hierarchies over the
                    last millennium (p. 151). Racism, in Fredrickson's view, is not just prejudicean attitude or set of
                    beliefsbut involves the creation and use of practices, institutions, and structures that allow a
                    dominant group to establish a racial order that they believe reflects the law of nature or God's
                    will.</p>
                <p>To make his case about what racism means and how it developed, Fredrickson divides his book into
                    three chapters. The first covers the long span from the Middle Ages to the start of the eighteenth
                    century. Particularly in the earlier part of that era, most Europeans worried more about people's
                    religious beliefs than about their skin color or Judaic ancestry. Being black or Jewish might mark a
                    person as inferior, but it was an inferiority that could be rectified by conversion to Christianity.
                    Racism did not flourish because there was not yet an ideology that led people to see race as
                    inherent and unalterable.</p>
                <p>That essentialist ideology developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with the rise of what
                    Fredrickson in chapter two calls "modern racism" (p. 49). In one of the West's greatest paradoxes,
                    the Enlightenment and racism grew together. This was no mere coincidence, but instead revealed the
                    Janusfaced nature of the Enlightenment. On the one hand, this system of rational thinking subverted
                    old hierarchies based on "faith, superstition, and prejudice." On the other hand, it created new
                    inequalities based on "reason, science, and history" (p. 63). Science, starting with the work of
                    Linnaeus in 1735, began ranking the human species with "acute, inventive" Europeans at the top and
                    "crafty, indolent" blacks and unscrupulous, clannish Jews at the bottom (p. 56).</p>
                <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-101-1-102"/>
                <p>This new vision led dominant groups in <placeName>

                    </placeName> to believe their societies would only survive if they created "racist regimes" (pp.
                    100-101). These regimes, which Fredrickson analyzes in chapter three, had several features that
                    distinguished them from earlier racist societies: they employed explicitly racist official
                    ideologies; they forbade interracial marriage; they mandated social segregation by law; they
                    excluded the subordinate group from formal political participation; and they forced the oppressed
                    into poverty. Nazi <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the Jim Crow South, and apartheid <placeName>
                        <country reg="sa">South Africa</country>
                    </placeName> implemented all of these rules and thus represented the climax of racism in the Western
                    world. None of these regimes survived World War II and the Cold War-a fact that, in Fredrickson's
                    view, offers little solace. In the future, he argues in an absorbing epilogue, new systems of
                    domination may arise based on religion rather than race.</p>
                <p>This is a powerful book, one that only a scholar with decades of experience could have written. While
                    Fredrickson supplies little new research, he draws on the historiography of three nations and the
                    newest theories of racial formation to make his case. His synthesis offers new ways of thinking
                    about racism in a broad temporal and geographic context, forcing us to think beyond national
                    boundaries and narrow time frames. It also shows how racism and anti-Semitism create analogous if
                    not identical systems of oppression. In all, this is a crucial book for anyone who wants to make
                    sense of the way racism has developed in the Western world.</p>

                <p>Schoon narrates the geological, biological, and human history of northern Indiana's Calumet region,

                    10,000 years), then goes on to trace the story of early European travel, the creation of the
                    Northwest Territory after the Revolutionary War, the changes brought by white settlement, and the
                    growth of the railroad after the Civil War. He follows this general narrative with short histories
                    of each town in the region through the early twentieth century, with postscripts highlighting recent
                    positive developments in each community's history. Readers will especially enjoy this volume's many

                    <hi rend="i">Play On</hi> chronicles one-hundred years of Indiana high school sports since the
                    establishment of the Indiana High School Athletic Association in December 1903. Not surprisingly,
                    much of the book focuses on boy's basketball, one of the oldest sports (along with boy's track and
                    field) to have an Indiana state high school championship. In addition to celebrating great players
                    and memorable teams, Beck also considers more difficult aspects of this history, including the
                    effects of racial segregation through the early 1940s, school consolidation in the late 1960s, and
                    the establishment of the basketball class system in 1996. Readers will enjoy the many photographs
                    and handsome design of the book.</p>

                                <p>I enjoyed reading the "conversation" with Reid Williamson (president of Historic
                                    Landmarks Foundation of Indiana) and Sal Cilella (president and CEO of the Indiana
                                    Historical Society) that appeared in the June issue. The <hi rend="i">Journal of
                                        Urban History</hi> ran a series of similar interviews some years ago, and they
                                    were always interesting and often informative. I hope the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                                        Magazine of History</hi> will publish similar pieces in the future.</p>
                                <p>I do, however, have one concern: the manner in which the interview was titled.
                                    Calling it "The State of Public History in Indiana" suggests that there is a
                                    monolithic public history community in the state and that Sal and Reid speak for it.
                                    Such is not the case. Indeed, since they direct the two largest and best-endowed
                                    historical organizations in Indiana, they are automatically unrepresentative of the
                                    state's public history community writ large.</p>
                                <p>A case in point is their unequivocal support for the creation of a Department of
                                    Indiana Heritage. Whether this is theoretically a good idea or not (even leaving
                                    aside the flawed legislation proposed thus far) is clearly open to debate, and it
                                    would be a mistake for your readers to assume, based on the interview, that all of
                                    the state's public historians are in agreement on this subject. In fact, those who
                                    would be most directly affected by such a proposal-the employees of the agencies
                                    involvedare precluded by the nature of their positions from speaking publicly on the
                                    merits and demerits of the plan.</p>
                                <p>In short, Clio's house has many mansions. While the opinions of the presidents of
                                    HLFI and IHS are of obvious interest, readers of the IMH should not be misled by the
                                    title of the interview into believing that those opinions reflect the beliefs of all
                                    public historians in Indiana.</p>
