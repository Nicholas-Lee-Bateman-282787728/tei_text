                    my life for the benefit of my children when I shall be removed by death. Of this removal I ought to

                    dangerous fever A bilious intermittent." Isaac Reed thus began his "Auto
                    Biography." One of the "giants" in the missionary field in
                    early-nineteenth-century Indiana,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Reed filled his manuscript with much
                    religious introspection and self-analysis, considerable factual detail, and myriad comments
                    concerning what he believed to be the ever-deteriorating state of his health. His account is typical
                    of many diaries and letters written by missionaries on the midwestern frontier in the 1800s.</p>
            <p>The first section of the autobiography covers Reeds life from his birth to 1817. Born in

               </placeName>, on August 27,
                    1787, of "pious," Congregationalist parents, Reed grew up in a "religious
                    settlement" where church attendance was "regular &amp; constant."
                    From the beginning, he confesses, "my heart was after books. I cannot tell when I did not
                    love more to be at school than to be employed on the farm. And usually when away from school, I
                    loved reading more than play." Reed graduated from <placeName>

                    "looked wistfully towards the ministry." Plagued throughout his life by severe
                    pulmonary problems, Reed feared that the frequent public speaking contingent upon a religious career
                    would be too rigorous for him, but by late 1813 he had nevertheless determined upon the ministry as
                    his profession. He resumed his studies and was licensed to preach by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> in May, 1816. During the next year he supplied several congregations in <placeName>

                    </placeName> as both temporary and resident pastor and was commissioned to work in the western part

                    </placeName> missionary societies. The consequent deterioration of his health made it necessary for
                    him to "endeavor to improve it. This I did," he wrote, "by travelling in
                    the Summer of 1817."</p>
            <p>Reed described the next period in his life, that from 1817 to 1826, in his book, <hi rend="i">The

                    </placeName>. Reed spent a large part of these nine years in the Hoosier state, seemingly always on
                    the move. Beginning in October, 1818, he served for one year as minister of a church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he established one of the first Sunday schools in the state. He resigned this

               </placeName>. In 1822 he purchased an eighty-acre farm in <placeName>

                    </placeName> near that of Baynard Rush Hall, his brother-in-law and future professor at the state

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Reed planned to reside in his "Cottage of Peace," serve as pastor of
                    a local church for one half his time, and spend the remainder traveling about the state as a
                    representative of an eastern missionary society. Travel he did—2,480 miles in 1824
                    alone—preaching, conducting ordinations and installations, and establishing still more
                    churches. During this period Reed founded at least eight congregations in Indiana, including ones at

                    On one such journey to the Midwest he decided to return to Indiana to live, and in the fall of 1828

            <p>Reed was typical of the early Presbyterian minister/missionary in the Hoosier state: he was well
                    educated and a Yankee. A Congregationalist in background, he was ordained by the Transylvania
                    Presbytery in October, 1818, and all his work and all the churches that he founded in Indiana were
                    for the Presbyterian.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Although not known as a stickler for the rules, he

                    that frontiersmen attached to what they considered "uppity," polished, cultured
                    preachers. Though often critical of many aspects of frontier society, he was a true friend of the
                    West and was apparently accepted as such.</p>
            <p>The portion of Reed's previously unpublished autobiography that is reproduced below begins
                    with the family's return to Indiana in the autumn of 1828 and concludes

                    of travel that Reed describes as part of his profession is in itself astounding. To be imagined are
                    the execrable road conditions, primitive housing, and inclement weather.</p>
            <p>Commissions for various eastern missionary societies occasioned many of Reed's journeys.
                    These groups were part of an organized missionary movement that began in the late 1700s and early
                    1800s both in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Formed purportedly to bring the Christian spirit to the
                    "unevangelized" and to convert the "heathen," the societies
                    initiated and provisioned countless missionary efforts on the frontier during the early nineteenth
                    century; their influence on religious development in the Midwest is incalculable.</p>
            <p>Reed, who served as agent for several such eastern groups, probably welcomed his missionary labor as
                    much for its financial benefits as for its religious implications. The missionary societies paid and
                    provided for their ministerial representatives; the small, local churches often did not. In many
                    cases congregations were simply unable to pay; cash was almost nonexistent on the frontier, and even
                    produce was sometimes hard to come by. Then, too, many Westerners believed that clergymen should not
                    expect remuneration for serving God. Reed and <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In an effort to supplement his income or, actually, to provide a living for his family, Reed
                    established and taught schools in virtually every community in which he resided. The amount of
                    illiteracy that he found in the Hoosier state appalled him. He learned on his very first missionary
                    journeys to ask if settlers could read before he handed out Bibles or religious tracts. Although he
                    considered the common schools in Indiana generally inferior to those in other northern states,<hi rend="sup">9</hi> his own endeavors illustrate the brevity and uncertainty of education in the
                    Midwest during the first half of the nineteenth century. Reed's schools rarely lasted
                    longer than a few months, sometimes only a few weeks. The missionary's poor health and his
                    religious commitments were frequently at fault; in addition, as one historian put it, those
                    "same settlers who did not pay their subscription to the church did not pay their tuition
                    to the school."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ironic that the Isaac Reed of the autobiography is not necessarily the leader in
                    "missionary statesmanship" that appears elsewhere.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The
                    minister emerges from his memoir as somewhat inept and rather selfish, a man inordinately concerned
                    with the status of his health and his soul. Almost immediately upon his arrival in the Midwest he
                    claimed that the climate was not as salubrious as he had been led to expect,<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
                    but he must have thrived on it: he was seventy when he died. In truth, he was often ill, but the
                    typical Hoosier settler of the early 1800s experienced "intermittent fever,"
                    "bilious fever," cholera, "milk sick," and similar complaints
                    more frequently that not. Reed was almost constantly on the move in the course of his
                    ministerial-missionary career; yet, he repeatedly resigned positions to travel to restore his
                    health. Mrs. Reed, though often sick herself, was apparently never accorded the same opportunity.
                    She also obviously reared the couple's children almost alone, as well as teaching to
                    augment the family's income. In fact, Reed rarely comments about his wife and children in
                    his autobiography, a fact that is perhaps as revealing as are his more numerous statements on
                    religion and education.</p>

                            relatively good, he indiscriminately used dashes, periods, or no punctuation at all to
                            conclude sentences; the editors have done the same, double-spacing where necessary to

                            earlier, it is possible that he erred as to the date; it is equally as possible that the

                            ministers in an area form the presbytery, a kind of corporate bishop. All presbyteries in a

                            churches, decided to raise their own. The college's first instructor was easterner
                            Caleb Mills, later to be influential in implementing Indiana's public school

                            farming, carpentering, wood-chopping, and related activities in return for credit on tuition
                            and board. Products of their labor were sold to aid the college. When it became difficult to
                            find enough varied jobs for the number of boys that were enrolled, the school purchased a
                            press and entered the printing business. Among other endeavors a religious newspaper, the
                                <hi rend="i">Western Presbyterian</hi>, was published, and agents were placed in the

                    the representation &amp; judgment of 3 or 4 men &amp; one or two women who reside there for
                    the sufficiency of the school. But when there &amp; ready to commence behold! numbers would not

                    Methodist Soc. &amp; it appeared they were unwilling to encourage a presbyterian minister. I

                    But the patronage was in a measure withdrawn from the next session &amp; after keeping 10 weeks

                    8th of April. Her mortal remains were laid down in the grave—in the burial ground where
                    they still repose. This death almost broke her mothers heart—&amp; to me it weakened
                    much my attachment to life—We were consoled in the hope that to her it was
                    gain—That whilst the body rests in the grave the spirit is with the Saviour whom she had

            <p>In 1980 the worldwide bicentennial of the Sunday school movement commemorated the establishment of a
                    Sabbath school in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Gloucester</settlement>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, by the newspaper publisher Robert Raikes. Raikes did not
                    create the Sunday school—there were such schools in both Britain and the British colonies
                    in North America before he became interested in the idea—but he gave the movement focus
                    and launched it into the orbit of eighteenth-century life as a potent Social force. It was thus the
                    Socially conscious and religiously committed Raikes who bore the derision of his contemporaries in
                    church and state in regard to Sunday schools. They called him "Bobby Wild
                        Goose"<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and the children he brought together his "ragged
                    regiment." These early critics failed to recognize that the Sabbath school brought elements
                    of fundamental education to the children of Britain's factories and helped to instill in
                    those youngsters discipline and moral values based upon teaching of the Bible. Indeed, many students
                    of the Sunday school movement contend that it deserves to stand beside the work of John Wesley in
                    the compilation of factors which prevented Britain from indulging in the violent upheavals of the
                    French Revolution. Still others believe that the Sunday school is the most distinctive contribution
                    of Protestant Christianity to the worldwide church.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>The English Sunday school movement spread quickly to the new nation on the eastern coast of North
                    America. Indeed, the American Sunday school soon outshone its British forerunner. Like the

            <p>It has long been a widely held assumption that the Sunday school movement in Indiana and the Middle

                    declared in his <hi rend="i">Historical Sketches of Sunday School Work</hi> in 1906: "The
                    first Indiana Sunday schools were not the product of the religious enthusiasm of the pioneers.
                    Rather they were a field for Christian missionaries from the churches of the East."

                    in the spread of Sunday schools in the West and effectively serviced the new movement, but all of

            <p>If the initial impetus in the Sunday school movement in Indiana came from southern-oriented Hoosier
                    lay workers, the spread of Sunday schools across the state and the "staying power"
                    of the movement do owe a decisive debt to the missionaries of the eastern Societies and the field
                    workers of the American Sunday School Union. The annual reports and other communications of these
                    groups attest to the vigor and dedication with which they prosecuted the campaign to bring Christian
                    education to the Indiana frontier. As early as 1830 Holman brought his twenty-unit Sunday school

                    the landmark Valley Resolution that "with reliance on divine aid determined "to

                    impact on the spread of Sunday schools in the West. Generally, too, the eastern organizations
                    serviced the Indiana schools with instructional materials, such as the American Sunday School
                    Union's libraries, which became the first significant collection of books in many Indiana

            <p>The pattern of Sunday school organization and propagation in Indiana reflects both the Hoosier
                    philosophy of independence and self-reliance and the spirit of cooperation prevalent on the
                    frontier. Hoosiers accepted encouragement and aid from the eastern Societies, but Sunday schools
                    were predominantly lay led, a fact which also, in part, illustrates the genius of the movement.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> The "union" principle was fundamental too. Sunday schools

                    Wiley recruited Fletcher as a teacher in the Methodist Sabbath school, and in 1842 the business
                    leader was elected one of five superintendents of the school. For seventeen years thereafter
                    Fletcher recorded in his diary accounts of many Sunday school activities, including colorful
                    parades, musical concerts by the children, and the first Sabbath School Convention, which he helped

            <p>The Hoosier Sunday school in its first half-century contributed positively to the moral climate of
                    frontier communities where drinking and boisterous recreation were the order of the day on the
                    Sabbath. John J. Funk, one of the leaders in the development of Sunday schools among the Mennonites,
                    believed that such schools were the best means of overcoming the religious illiteracy and
                    indifference threatening Society, eliminating Sabbath desecration, fostering worship and reverence,
                    facilitating evangelism, and nurturing the spiritual life.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> A story by Isaac
                    Reed illustrates the negative quality of the environment to which the Sunday schools addressed
                    themselves. An upright farmer, approached by Reed to join in the call to worship services and a
                    Sabbath school, said he could not afford to sign a notice but would put it up at the neighborhood
                    still where everybody would see it.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The mobilization of spiritual resources in

                    pre–Civil War Indiana was a close one. The forward-looking Article IX of
                    Indiana's first constitution in 1816—unique among the constitutions in the
                    states of the Northwest Territory—called for a general system of education and
                    established means to implement a public school fund and create public libraries. This dream was slow
                    of realization. In 1840 George H. Dunn, state superintendent of common schools, reported that 1,521
                    primary schools were giving instruction to only 48,189 children out of 273,784 between the ages of
                    five and twenty in the state.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> An Indiana Sunday school missionary's
                    report in 1837 perhaps typifies the Hoosier educational situation: "In 23 counties of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country there are, as we are informed, only 61 common schools. Several of the 23
                    counties have but a single school and there are five or six which have no schools at
                        all."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Such conditions provided incentive for funding Sunday
                    schools, and these schools often preceded the public schools, bringing the first opportunity for
                    formal education to the children in many communities. In addition, Sunday school libraries
                    frequently constituted the only collection of books in a pioneer community. In many instances Sunday
                    schools also supported, encouraged, and, on occasion, provided standards of teaching for the
                    emerging public schools. In its first annual report of 1826 the Indiana Sunday School Union
                    enunciated as policy: "Let Sabbath schools be established wherever practicable. They will
                    answer the double purpose of paving the way for common schools, and serving as a substitute until
                    they are generally formed. Parents and children, becoming sensible to the sweets and benefits of
                    learning, will unite in one loud and determined call for the permanent means of
                        education."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Holman believed that the best teachers in the public
                    schools were also in the Sunday schools, "one school complementary to the
                        other."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Indeed, at least one spokesman for the American Home
                    Missionary Society felt that deficiencies in the salaries of pious school teachers should be paid by
                    the Society as were the salaries of missionaries.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The importance of the Sunday school as a factor in the general education of the public ended in

                    ability to attract like-minded leaders, they produced educational innovations that captured public
                    imagination. Within a year their missionary zeal had penetrated Indiana where their recruits formed
                    a state Sunday school association at an organizing convention in <placeName>

            <p>The Indiana association grew rapidly. The second convention, held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> on June 5–7, 1866, provided a preview of Indiana conventions for the rest of
                    the century and was typical of the assemblies of the faithful in other states. Featured was a mass
                    meeting of all the Sunday schools in the area, which meeting was opened with a rousing rendition of
                    the song, "The Sunday School Army." A Committee on Permanent Organization was set
                    up, and Colonel John W. Ray, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> leader, was elected president. A lengthy discussion of the relationship of the Sunday
                    school to the church resulted in the declaration that "The Sabbath school is the Nursery of
                    the Lord and it shall be used as a means of replenishing the church." Another resolution
                    called for the organization of a teachers' institute in each congressional district.
                    Indications of an emerging Social conscience also appeared in the 1866 convention. A resolution
                    demanded that more strenuous efforts be made "to bring poor and destitute children under
                    influence of Sabbath school instruction and culture." There was feeling that the Sunday
                    school was becoming a middle-class institution. On the first day convention delegates received and
                    tabled a resolution asking the schools to seek signers of temperance and anti-tobacco pledges. The
                    next day convention delegates adopted a more general statement supporting a "great
                    temperance reformation."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    Indiana Sunday School Association. The meeting place in the opera house overflowed. A combined choir
                    of one thousand children charmed the convention, which also witnessed a lengthy procession of Sunday
                    school scholars headed by the Star City Band. Leaders were pleased with the high level of enthusiasm

                    presidency from Ray, who successfully sponsored a resolution advising each school to organize a
                    "normal class" composed of persons willing to teach. From such trained persons
                    teachers for the Sunday school classes could be selected.</p>

                    </placeName> marked the appearance of the comprehensive statistical report, a characteristic of all
                    later conventions. This first report recorded 580 schools; 46,791 scholars; an average attendance of
                    32,369; 2,243 scholars professing religion during the year; 80,780 volumes in libraries; 240,196
                    papers and pamphlets distributed; and $13,092.84 in benevolent contributions. Noteworthy

                    interruption of librarians bringing round the books for loan; that time should not be
                    "wasted on the geography of Bible lands"; that memorization was being
                    overemphasized; that no child "should read more than he can be taught to
                    understand"; that conditions for rewards should be such that "they can be attained
                    by any scholar in the school"; and that the prime objective was "to lead children
                    to Christ."</p>

                    </placeName> convention played up some of the drama and color always attached to these annual
                    gatherings. On the second day the agenda was interrupted to hear a concert by two thousand Sunday
                    school children. The children, in gala dress, met in their churches, then marched two abreast, led
                    by the "splendid Jones Cornet Band," to the assembly point at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> Street Methodist Church, largest in the city. The lively account of the day noted that,
                    with their teachers beside them, the children "fluttered along in white dresses and gay
                    ribbons with beautiful flags and appropriate banners floating overall." Children of the
                    host church sang "Glory Be to God"; those from Second Presbyterian Church offered
                    "The Volunteer Song"; from the English Lutheran Church "Land Without a
                    Storm"; and from Centenary Methodist "My House Upon a Rock." The boys and
                    girls from the German Reformed school, singing in German, "maintained the most excellent
                    perfect time and won a merited applause." The other selections were "Sing
                    Jesus' Name" by the combined choruses of the Third and Fourth Presbyterian
                    churches; "In a Manger Laid" by the Baptist Sunday school;

            <p>In 1873 William Levering of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was destined to become the inspiring and effective guiding spirit of the Sunday
                    school movement in Indiana, became for the first time an officer of the association. Appointed to
                    collect statewide statistics, Levering went after his job with characteristic vigor and in 1874
                    reported 3,116 schools with 32,643 officers and teachers and 252,000 scholars. Shortly thereafter
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe County</region>
                    </placeName> leader was elected to the presidency of the association and with "entire
                    consecration and consummate generalship devoted time and his great physical, mental and spiritual
                    powers" to the full organization of the Sunday school movement in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> In the next three years President Levering traveled the length and breadth of the state,
                    addressed hundreds of meetings, wrote over one thousand letters, prayed, prodded, and cajoled. By
                    1877 he could report to the convention that the Hoosier state had achieved complete standard
                    organization. Indiana was a "Banner State," one of only three in the nation having
                    all of its counties organized and a county convention in every one during the year. Levering
                    proclaimed a "Year of Jubilee" and called for thanks to God for "the
                    thousands of children gathered in and for those who spoke His name in a whisper or with a blush but
                    now proclaim their faith unabashed." In his presidential address in 1877 Levering asserted
                    that these grand results had been accomplished "without the expense of one dollar to anyone
                    connected with the association." Indiana's secret, he declared, lay in the fact
                    that "her sons and daughters have rendered all unto God as a thank offering for
                    Jesus' sake." To keep things going the president called for the creation of an
                    executive board "with discrimination between emotional gas and consecrated grit."
                    The statistics for 1877 indicated 3,965 reporting schools; 39,357 teachers and officers; 310,936
                    scholars; an average attendance of 217,782; 7,350 received into church membership; and
                    $15,434.79 in benevolent contributions.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>

            <p>In 1872 Indiana and its Sunday school association played a major role in one of the most significant
                    developments in the Sunday school movement nationwide—the establishment of the
                    International or Uniform Sunday School Lesson System. At its convention in 1867 the Indiana Sunday
                    School Union had adopted a resolution calling for the resumption of the national conventions, which
                    had lapsed after 1859. The first convention in the renewed series was held at <placeName>

                    the state program, Gilbert was unpopular with the largely rural Sunday school movement. Funding was

                    Meigs, Jr., to executive leadership. From 1893 to 1900 Meigs carried the movement forward
                    decisively. One of his innovations was the launching of <hi rend="i">The Awakener</hi>, house organ
                    of the Sunday school movement for fifty years.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Another of Meigs's
                    ideas was the Home Department, a pioneer development among the nation's Sunday schools.
                    This program enrolled persons confined to their homes and provided a curriculum for their study.
                    Under Meigs and his successors Indiana maintained a position of national leadership. State
                    conventions drew upward of three thousand delegates with more than five thousand gathering for the
                    traditional picnics, concerts, and parades. The statistics reported to the convention at <placeName>

                    and teachers, 580,231 enrollment in 5,388 schools, and average attendance of 391,957. Significant in
                    these statistics was the listing of 3,895 chartered adult Bible classes. These classes had grown up
                    after 1900. In some churches they not only dominated the Sunday school scene, but attendance in them
                    was often greater than that of the worship services in the churches which fostered them.</p>

                    150,000 Americans were reputedly enrolled in such courses in Greek and Hebrew. Harper also founded
                    the Religious Education Association.</p>
            <p>Beginning about 1920, Vacation Bible Schools became a concern of the Sunday school forces. In that

                    </placeName> to the Indiana State Convention to speak on "Utilizing Vacation Time for
                    Religious Education." Soon the Children's Division of the Sunday school
                    association assumed responsibility for promoting the vacation schools, and training programs were
                    devised to prepare teachers and administrators of these summer schools of religion.</p>
            <p>In the conventions of the early years of the twentieth century resolutions appeared in support of
                    accredited Bible study courses in Indiana high schools. Such a program was instituted through the

                    accumulated half-credits toward graduation for a semester's study of the Old or New
                    Testament. The classes were usually taught by pastors or religious educators outside the school

                    over the nation.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Approximately 50,000 children, mostly in the fourth and fifth
                    grades, attended released-time classes at the peak of the program's popularity in Indiana.
                    When legal decisions ruled out weekday classes within the schools themselves, the Christian
                    education forces worked for the legalization of locally sponsored classes outside school buildings
                    in nearby churches or mobile classrooms. In 1943, for example, the state Sunday school convention
                    declared its support for House Bill 195, the Religious Education Bill, which allowed weekday
                    released-time classes up to 120 minutes a week.</p>
            <p>Sunday schools even evolved their own particular style of architecture—the famous (or, to
                    some critics, infamous) "Akron Plan." Developed in the last quarter of the
                    nineteenth century in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ohio city</settlement>
                    </placeName> from which it took its name, the Akron-style arrangement was chosen by almost all
                    congregations at the end of the Victorian era when they undertook construction of religious
                    education facilities. The plan called for a theater-style central room with a stage from which the
                    superintendent conducted the Sunday school. This central room provided the assembly hall for opening
                    and closing exercises and for plays, concerts, and other events rising out of the Sunday school
                    program. On the stage, also, there was room for the Sunday school orchestra, which often played to
                    welcome the arriving "scholars" and later marched them off to class. The assembly
                    hall might also be the locale for the men's Bible class (although frequently this class
                    could only be accommodated in the sanctuary or the church dining room in the basement). The Akron
                    design was well adapted to schools using the uniform lessons, for from his lofty pinnacle on the
                    stage the superintendent could actually see into the many classes in alcoves off the central hall
                    and sometimes off the balcony as well when such a feature was included by the architect.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                    to the survey, Indiana's churches had not, for the most part, assumed responsibility for
                    organizing, administering, or planning their church schools, most of which were quite small. Of
                    those studied, the median school was in a one-room church with eight classes, and in 65 percent of
                    the schools the average attendance was under one hundred. Income for the church schools was derived
                    from regular and special offerings and from individual contributions. The schools spent 55.8 percent
                    of their resources on themselves and 44.2 percent on other religious work, with denominational
                    causes—especially missions—placing highest. Teachers were profiled as sincere,
                    devoted Christians of mature years, untrained and unsupervised.</p>
            <p>One result of the 1920 survey was increased emphasis on a higher degree of professionalism in the
                    Sunday school movement. In succeeding decades Hoosier Sunday schools reflected this national trend.

                    turn promoted the new ideas. Leaders in the movement questioned the International Uniform Lessons
                    and suggested that they be replaced by graded lessons tailored to the maturity level of the
                    students. Denominations at long last became full partners in the educational enterprise. On December

                    by the affiliating denominations.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Indiana soon adopted the pattern of a

                    Churches, representing the Christian life and work aspect of American Protestantism, and of the
                    International Council of Religious Education. The Indiana Council of Churches was organized in

            <p>In the past twenty years Sunday schools in the mainline Protestant churches have declined. As an
                    example, average attendance in Sunday schools of the Indiana Baptist Convention (American Baptist)
                    fell from 48,928 in 1958 to 34,375 in 1975 (a 30 percent drop). For the United Methodist churches
                    enrollment went from 335,033 in 1960 to 183,656 in 1978 (a 45 percent loss) and average attendance
                    dropped from 169,562 to 90,349 (47 percent). The Southern Baptists, the Assemblies of God, and the
                    independent, fundamental Baptists and Christians maintain the largest Sunday schools in Indiana
                    today. These churches are reviving the Indiana Sunday School Convention, which lapsed in the 1950s,
                    and are quick to assert that they now carry the revered Sunday school banner. Mainline Protestant
                    churches, in which the number of Sunday schools, enrollment, and attendance have declined during the
                    last twenty years, continue to evaluate their place in the Sunday school movement and the place of
                    the Sunday school overall as a means of nurturing Christian faith and practice.</p>

                            took the date from newspaper accounts of Wright's death in 1867 which listed the
                            date of his birth as 1810. The records of early Indiana legislatures contained in the
                            English Collection at the Indiana Historical Society library list Wright as twenty-four when
                            he served in the 1833–1834 session of the General Assembly. This would mean, if
                            correct, that Wright had to have been born in 1809, for the session ended before his
                            birthday in April 1834. Moreover, references by Wright himself to events in his life at
                            particular ages support the 1809 date. Probably the best evidence comes from a genealogy
                            taken from a family Bible … citing Wright's birth date as
                            1809." Philip M. Crane, "Governor Jo Wright: Hoosier

            <p>This entry in the Record need not be interpreted as meaning that Wright had unlawfully taken these
                    books from the library when he left office. In fact, early librarians were often fiscally
                    responsible for all books in their libraries. The Record itself contains an entry detailing some of
                    the librarians' responsibilities in this regard: "the Librarian [will] report at
                    each meeting of the Board any injury done to any and every book and the person by whom injured, and
                    on failure to report as above he shall be accountable for the injury done."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Thus the implication of the order "to call on Joseph A. Wright a former
                    Librarian" most likely means that the itemized books were missing from the collection and
                    that Wright had not reported this loss; since Wright had been librarian, he was responsible for the
                    books. The Record does not indicate that this matter was ever brought to suit, and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> court records do not indicate that such a suit was ever filed. An examination of the
                    Record reveals that current librarians were frequently authorized by the board to call upon former
                    librarians for missing books.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

               <hi rend="i">Bowen: The Years as Governor</hi>. By William J. Watt. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Bierce Associates, Inc., 1981. Pp. [x], 308. Illustrations, appendixes, note on
                    sources, notes, index. $17.95.)</head>
            <p>William J. Watt has written an informative and significant book about Dr. Otis R. Bowen, the only
                    Hoosier ever to serve his state as governor for eight full consecutive years. Watt provides
                    perceptive background regarding the political, economic, Social, and cultural events of the Bowen
                    years. Before serving as an executive assistant to Bowen throughout his two terms, Watt had been a
                    writer and an editor for the Associated Press, then an administrative assistant to Lieutenant
                    Governor Richard Folz in the preceding administration of Governor Edgar D. Whitcomb. Under Bowen,
                    Watt served as news secretary and as liaison for various continuing and miscellaneous projects;
                    these tasks necessitated frequent communication with the chief executive. The book, commenced months
                    before the Bowen tenure ended, is based on party records, newspapers, oral interviews, personal
                    recollections, legislative records, and the Bowen papers. The text is quite readable, but occasional
                    misspelled words perhaps suggest some haste in writing and less copyediting than desirable.</p>
            <p>Watt regards tax restructuring, in order to provide property tax relief, as the cornerstone and key
                    innovation of the Bowen administration. He gives the governor quite favorable marks for his handling
                    of such areas as transportation, energy shortage, natural disasters, coal strikes, and the
                    Department of Natural Resources. Mental health, corrections, state police, and the Alcoholic
                    Beverage Commission are discussed as troubled areas for which results were less successful. Bowen,
                    Watt notes, often viewed accomplishments of the Department of Natural Resources among the top
                    achievements of his administration. For these accomplishments the governor deserves much credit
                    since he delegated substantial authority to Joseph D. Cloud, its capable director, and also approved
                    the continuation of John Hillenbrand, a Democrat who had given outstanding service to previous
                    administrations, as chairman of its two key commissions. Watt's account and evaluations
                    should be extremely useful to historians, although as further information becomes
                    available—including that from other participants—differing versions and
                    conclusions may be expected concerning various issues.</p>
            <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-078-3-064"/>
            <p>Watt gives considerable attention to Bowen's personal views and qualities. Although quite
                    fond of the governor, Watt is frequently candid in assessing the governor's strengths and
                    his limitations. The author appropriately notes that during recent decades managing Indiana state
                    government has become a demanding and difficult enterprise, but an enterprise vastly different from
                    running a large business. Watt portrays Bowen as a very astute and skillful politician, which he
                    certainly was. He also describes the governor as a somewhat more liberal Republican than most party
                    leaders and as one who sought to enlarge the party's base among the electorate. While this
                    reviewer agrees with Watt that Bowen was an unusually popular governor, probably the most popular
                    one since the pioneer era, in some respects the popularity of Governor William Hendricks,
                    1822–1825, was even more pronounced.</p>

            <p>While Robert A. Trennert was engaged in research on a previous book, he discovered a significant
                    omission in scholarly literature about federal Indian policy. He learned that the economic and
                    political activities of the firm of W. G. &amp; G. W. Ewing Company, who traded with Indian
                    tribes living in a vast region from Indiana to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, had been neglected. The study which resulted "is a chronicle of frontier
                    business and political influence" as practiced by the brothers William G. and George W.
                    Ewing; as Trennert carefully states, it is "not a study of Indians" (p. xii).</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, farming and trading as they went. Alexander Ewing, the patriarch of the clan,
                    settled at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> in 1822, built a log store and tavern, and in 1823 purchased land in the center of the
                    city. Soon the firm of A. Ewing &amp; Sons began a thriving Indian trade centered at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. They plunged into this highly competitive business and gradually carved out an
                    increasingly larger share of the trade with the Miami and Potawatomi tribes. Indians debtors settled
                    their accounts at cession treaties when they received cash, annuities, and parcels of land. After
                    1827, when Alexander died, the twenty-five <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-078-3-065"/> year-old William
                    managed the company's daily activities while George, twenty-two, traveled throughout the
                    region overseeing the trading posts. In pursuing their fortunes, George and William made enemies,
                    and they ignored pleasure. and leisure. The Ewings had few other options because competitors such as
                    the American Fur Company or later Pierre Chouteau, Jr., &amp; Company would have destroyed them
                    if an opportunity had arisen.</p>
            <p>For ten years William and George Ewing concentrated upon the Indian trade and treaties with the
                    Miamis and Potawatomis of northern Indiana. Government contracts for goods distributed to Indians at
                    cession treaties in the 1820s and 1830s were valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars. Political
                    influence was need to gain a contract, and frequently political manipulation continued until the
                    federal officials signed vouchers redeeming the contract. When the Indian population was removed
                    west of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, the Ewings followed their customers to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> and resumed trading goods for furs and skins of Indian hunters. The hostility of Pierre
                    Chouteau, Jr., and the James K. Polk administration very nearly drove the Ewings from the western
                    Indian trade. The election of Zachary Taylor in 1848, however, restored a more favorable political
                    climate for the Ewings, who then "effectively dictated all aspects of Indian affairs even
                    remotely involving their business." By 1851 the Ewings were "probably the single
                    most influential force in determining federal Indian policy" (p. 175). During these years
                    George spent much of his time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wa">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, fashioning alliances with congressmen, senators, and administrative officials.</p>
            <p>The Ewing brothers, by "profit or plunder," amassed significant fortunes from the
                    Indian trade. When William died in 1854, his estate was valued at $750,000.00, and
                    George's estate at his death in 1866 was worth well over a million dollars. Their business
                    methods were not above reproach. The Ewings were accused of charging the Sac and Fox excessive
                    prices and of falsifying account records, resulting in a reduction of an $84,000.00 claim
                    by 25 percent. This was not an isolated instance. How was it done? George W. Ewing lobbied Congress
                    and the officials of the Ofice of Indian Affairs. Working with friendly agents and superintendents,
                    he pushed through Congress appropriations bills to pay claims and prevent investigations. Indian
                    agents and tribal chiefs were appointed or dismissed to assure favorable treaty terms for Indian
                    traders. If necessary, the traders controlled payments to the tribes, supervised Indian removals
                    west, and represented Indian tribes in negotiations with the federal government. In the Age of <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-078-3-066"/> Jackson "All of these activities were regarded as a
                    legitimate part of their ordinary business activity" (p. 207). As Trennert concludes,
                    "it was the Indians who suffered. Neither government policy nor the trading system
                    benefited them. They were unceremoniously removed over and over again until the few survivors were
                    relegated to small, isolated reservations" (p. 209).</p>
            <p>This book contains solid research based upon archival, primary, and secondary sources. It is detailed
                    yet clearly written, and scholars and students of business and Indian history can read it
                    profitably. Trennert has diligently sought out relatively unused sources and significantly enlarged
                    knowledge about the formation and application of federal Indian policy from the 1820s into the
                    1850s.</p>

            <p>The author of <hi rend="i">The Investment Frontier</hi> contends "that eastern capitalists,
                    operating from the country's financial centers in <placeName>

                    were essential to frontier economic development and the integration of the West into the
                    nation's economy" (p. xi). He proceeds to test this contention by depicting in
                    considerable detail the entrepreneurial careers of three men who helped provide this
                    "eastern connection" for the Old Northwest and other frontier regions in the 1830s
                    and 1840s. These men were Isaac Bronson, his son Arthur Bronson—both of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName>—and their sometimes close associate, Charles Butler of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Geneva</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                            York</region>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Combining their own outstanding financial talents with those of a network of carefully selected
                    "agents" in undeveloped but promising frontier regions, these three men provided a
                    conduit for passage of investment capital from East to West. The western regions gained
                    significantly from access to this capital, and those supplying it made a good return (6 to 12
                    percent) on their money. Isaac Bronson was the mentor of the trio. Extremely conservative in his
                    investment strategies, he designed "trust companies" (the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Life Insurance and Trust Company in 1834) as devices for pooling available eastern
                    capital for investment in the West. Through the managerial skills of his son Arthur and protege <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, these accumulated investment funds helped underwrite the initial development of

                  <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Grand
                        Rapids</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, and several other
                    "paper towns" in the Great Lakes region. Equally important, this eastern capital
                    was made accessible to prospective purchasers of farm land in several of the Old Northwest states,
                    including Indiana.</p>
            <p>The writer acknowledges that the Bronsons and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> were land speculators, but, as the term applies to them, he dismisses any negative
                    overtones it may have. Despite their keen ability to turn a profit, all were honest, honorable, and
                    judicious men. The elder Bronson is portrayed as an advanced economic thinker, whose views and
                    policies might have helped the American nation avoid the financial pitfalls of the late 1830s if his
                    advice had been heeded. <placeName>

                    promoting financial ventures within the context of political realities. He is the Charles Butler who

            <p>Haeger's <hi rend="i">The Investment Frontier</hi> contains much enlightening information
                    relating to the complicated land speculation issue. It is well researched and well written. If there
                    is a criticism, it is that the writer may have pushed his contention beyond the facts arrayed. Were
                    there as many Bronsons and Butlers around the Old Northwest as he suggests? Historians may not know
                    for certain, but after reading this book they may be more on the lookout for them.</p>

            <p>The process of town promotion has long attracted students of popular culture. Daniel J. Boorstin,
                    Charles N. Glaab, Richard C. Wade, and many others have ably discussed the ways in which American
                    optimism and ambition found release <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-078-3-068"/> in efforts to
                    "boost" western towns. Carl Abbott attempts to join this group with his study of
                    promotional activity in four mid-western cities—<placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
               </placeName>, and Galena—Auring the boom years
                    1848–1857. Most of this book is concerned with boosterism as "popular economic
                    thought" in the four cities. Although Abbott acknowledges the flamboyant side of booster
                    thinking, he chooses to emphasize a form of town promotion that featured "realistic
                    analysis" of circumstances; those who look for the power of the driving dream will be
                    disappointed. For the rest, he concentrates on the distinctive economic personalities and policies
                    of each of the four cities. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> stands out here for its calm and reasonable pursuit of "well-measured economic
                    goals" (p. 1721, the most important one being to make itself the service center for
                    Indiana; the author notes that neither the city nor its state exhibited the aggressive booster
                    spirit evident elsewhere, a point the implications of which he chooses not to explore. In contrast, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> comes off badly as a city inhibited by its early success and by the complexities
                    Associated with its maturing urban character. Abbott calls attention to the fact that Galena once
                    considered itself a commercial rival of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By the 1850s, however, it had lost out to booming <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which had succeeded in attracting business talent and capital from the East.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Boosters and Businessmen</hi> adds to the knowledge of the urban Middle West. It is not,
                    however, a book which can be recommended to either the general reader or the scholar. In style, it
                    reads like a doctoral dissertation—even though Abbott is credited with three previously
                    published works; it is but a pallid rendering of the enthusiasm and energy that infused one of the
                    most extraordinary periods of growth in American history. More essentially, Abbott has clouded his
                    subject by equating boosterism, Associated with early town formation, with the response of maturing
                    cities to the complexities Associated with maturation. By so doing he has thrown away the
                    opportunity to discuss the evolution of civic entrepreneurship from the days of open opportunities
                    to times when realities were more compelling than dreams. He has compounded this failure by his
                    indifference to the political side of town promotion, particularly the efforts of urban business
                    communities to influence state and federal policy. How, one wonders, can popular economic thought be
                    adequately discussed without reference to the most popular way of forming and implementing public
                    thinking? In sum, this book provides much useful information, but it will disappoint those who are
                    looking for understanding either of the ways that <pb n="255" id="VAA4025-078-3-069"/> urban
                    midwesterners viewed their collective selves and futures or of the process of urban growth in
                    America's heartland.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Growing Up in the Midwest</hi>, edited by Clarence A. Andrews, is a thoughtful, pleasant
                    vaudeville of reminiscences by twenty-two authors, most of whom are alive and still writing. This is
                    a collection that can be picked up in an idle moment or before bed, since the longest selection can
                    be read in ten or fifteen minutes and the shortest is less than a page.</p>
            <p>The Middle West has not had a towering literary figure who has clearly and powerfully defined the
                    region for the world, as William Faulkner has done for the South, for instance. Most of the major
                    American writers of this century, however—Ernest Hemingway, T.S. Eliot, F. Scott
                    Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, Carl Sandburg, Bret Hart, Stephen Crane, Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair
                    Lewis—were born in the region, even if many of them drifted toward <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> and wrote often of those places. If the Midwest has not thus emerged in literature in a
                    dramatic, monolithic fashion, that is as it should be for a region so large and diversified.</p>
            <p>Andrews, in his short introduction, shuns a strict geographical definition of the Midwest and instead
                    quotes William Carter's definition of the region as "a home place: sometimes
                    narrowly disapproving, but nurturing and loving, and preserving the style of the era before America
                    moved away to the city" (p. vi). Again and again the selections will remind readers of the
                    importance of this nurturing, of this home place, for these midwesterners as they scattered across
                    the country and the globe. R. V. Cassill, in "An Orbit of Small Towns," uses a
                    metaphor from physics to make the point: "it seems to me we were always headed back toward
                    [the farm which was our home] as we moved away, governed by components of centrifugal and
                    centripetal forces that permitted neither escape nor return" (p. 119).</p>
            <p>The elegiac strain that runs through the collection stops well before it reaches nostalgia. For the
                    most part these articles and stories and poems are convincing, believable, and realistic. <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-078-3-070"/> If no unified design emerges from the patchwork quilt of
                    experiences, the individual selections are nonetheless worthwhile.</p>
            <p>Among the best in the collection are the pieces by James Stevens, Edna Ferber, Harry Mark Petrakis,
                    and Hugh Sidey. The Stevens story, "A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Town," reawakens memories of the camp meetings and wonderful, itinerant frauds
                    that were part of the excitement of a turn-of-the-century prairie community, especially for a
                    latter-day Huck Finn who says that "all of this made a pretty risky environment for me, as
                    I was not naturally a good boy" (p. 22). The Ferber excerpt presents a most moving sketch
                    of a community of German Jews in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> on Yom Kippur. Petrakis reveals an unruly, impressionable South <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> boy discovering the meaning of his Greek heritage through a Greek grocer who tells him:
                    "You are a bonehead. You don't understand that a whole nation and a people are in
                    this store" (p. 113). Sidey fully recreates the atmosphere of his small-town, family
                    newspaper and the thrill of listening to his favorite sportscaster, Ronald "Dutch"
                    Reagan, who "could make dull games bubble" (p. 157).</p>
            <p>Andrews's sometimes lengthy headnotes for the authors are useful, if of uneven quality. (The
                    ugly flower design used to begin the headnotes is balanced by the most attractive dust-cover.)
                    Cultural historians of the Middle West will be particularly interested in the fine historical
                    photographs which accompany the stories.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> native, sought to explain "the dynamics of change" and "to
                    avoid romanticizing the past into something it was not" (preface).</p>
            <p>The reader might not be certain, however, what to make of this work. The dimensions of the book and
                    its ample illustrations suggest, on the one hand, a pictorial history intended for a coffee table or
                    a waiting room; that is, for casual reading. Unfortunately, the quality of photographic reproduction
                    is uneven, and there is a paucity of maps to assist the nonlocal reader in understanding such
                    matters as election patterns and neighborhood growth. Out of the several hundred illustrations,
                    moreover, only about thirty deal specifically with women, blacks, or laborers. The bulk of the
                    illustrations treat architectural and business history. Tables depicting population trends and
                    election results would also have been helpful.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, one suspects that the author intended to write an amply illustrated historical
                    treatise. That effort is deficient for several reasons. The book fails to examine systematically the
                    factors making for urbanization in the region; for example, the structure and dynamics of leadership
                    or the evolution of neighborhoods. The author writes anecdotally and provides a number of
                    fascinating stories about such episodes as the disputed election and nativist riot of 1855 but
                    offers generally sketchy and loosely organized treatment of most issues. For example, the author
                    devotes four lines to Charles Jacob, whom he defines—without explanation—as
                    the city's most popular mayor, and surprisingly does not explain the development of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Chamber of Commerce. There is also a lack of balance here. Most of the work treats <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, not <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>. Some vital subjects are given short shrift. In the chapter on the 1930s, for instance,
                    labor history is given four lines, half that afforded the local symphony. Two brief paragraphs touch
                    upon Social changes produced by World War 11. Only seven pages treat the crucial years
                    1945–1960, in which the rise of suburbs and the change in corporate control were making
                    significant alterations in the nature of local decision-making. This reader also finds unusual the
                    publication of a separate volume of footnotes, which the author states could not be included in the
                    history that he wrote. This work does not, in short, explain much about "the dynamics of
                    change." It offers little more than a series of glimpses into the local past of <placeName>

            <p>Significant anniversaries of Indiana's Catholic parishes usually result in the publication
                    of commemorative books. Within these books the parish priest or an amateur local historian presents
                    a brief account of parish history. <hi rend="i">Slaves to No One</hi> represents a distinct
                    departure from these customary anniversary publications. James J. Divita is a professor of history
                    at Marian College, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and his book is a full-scale, professional effort.</p>
            <p>Holy Trinity parish and the Haughville neighborhood that it served were both products of industrial
                    growth in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By the turn of this century foundry and other factory industries attracted European
                    immigrants seeking work. The Holy Trinity community consisted of Slovene immigrants, South Slavs
                    from the northwest corner of the Balkan peninsula. Divita traces the Social and economic forces
                    leading to Slovene migration to America and specifically examines the immigrants' arrival
                    in Haughville. The clear majority of the immigrants had been peasants in Slovenia and became
                    blue-collar laborers in Haughville's industries.</p>
            <p>Holy Trinity emerged after a rift with a nearby Irish parish that the Slovenes had first attended.
                    Within his detailed history of Holy Trinity parish, Divita presents biographical sketches of the
                    priests and nuns who contributed to the church's spiritual and physical growth. He properly
                    places the church within the context of the immigrant neighborhood it served; thus, he includes the
                    Social history of Holy Trinity's immigrant and American-born members. Divita discusses
                    their factory occupations, small businesses, fraternal Societies, housing, diet, customs, and family
                    life in Haughville. He concludes with an examination of changes in Holy Trinity's mission
                    as Slovene-Americans left Haughville in the face of black and southern-white migration into the
                    aging neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Divita's book touches some of the major themes in Indiana's urban, ethnic, and
                    religious history. <hi rend="i">Slaves to No One</hi> is a first-rate effort.</p>

            <p>The author has spent many years compiling documents for this volume, an evident labor of love. Her
                    subject is rich in plot and subplot. Idiosyncratically organized, and neither systematic nor
                    comprehensive, this book unfortunately serves no imaginable readership and obeys few canons of
                    historical scholarship or good writing.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to describe this work. Its title suggests a history; yet, its text is neither a new
                    or full account of George Rogers Clark, of his Revolutionary War activity, nor of the war on the
                    frontier. It adds no new synthesis to what has been available in the older works of James A. James
                    or William H. English or newer ones of Jack M. Sosin or popular works of John Bakeless, Dale Van
                    Every, or this reviewer.</p>
            <p>Three fourths of the volume consists of documents, many long in print or already thoroughly mined,
                    except, perhaps, for the little used Haldiman papers from the "British Library"
                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. This would seem to call for Seineke to be listed as editor rather than
                    author. As author, she has written five chapters of text. In addition, Professor Robert M. Sutton,
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, has provided, fortunately, an introduction that is an orderly overview. A curious
                    addition to this medley is a study by a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> attorney, Anton J. Pregaldin, identifying 118 signers of the oath Clark required of
                    French villagers at Vin-cennes.</p>
            <p>As the author wends her antiquarian way discursively from one topic to another, her allusive text
                    leaves one wondering what her subject is. The bulk of the book that is devoted to documents is not
                    without interest, but the documents cry out for proper editing. Many selections are peripheral and
                    irrelevant, a strange intermingling in chronological order of disparate subjects ranging from
                    Clark's activities to baptisms, property transfers among <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> villagers, and litigation between traders and suppliers. One finds surprisingly little
                    of substance about the lives of ordinary people despite the author's claim of research
                    "on the grass roots level" (p. ix). In one instance the editor astonishingly
                    admits to rearranging the paragraphs from an item reprinted from the <hi rend="i">Magazine of
                        American History</hi> (pp. 545–52).</p>
            <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-078-3-074"/>
            <p>Format is awkward. Editorial comment, where it is supplied, is often irrelevant and typographically
                    indistinguishable from the documentary text. Documents are numbered by the author and cite unique
                    abbreviations of the author's own devising. A list of abbreviations serves as bibliography,
                    mixing manuscript collections, printed sources, and secondary works. To criticism of content and
                    format, one must add an inadequate index. The text is photographically reproduced in unattractive
                    typescript, notwithstanding handsome outer covers and a big price.</p>
            <p>The author has not shaped a disciplined work from her trove. A reader who spends time with this
                    "book" will make as big a mistake as the author and publisher made in presenting
                    it in this form.</p>

            <p>I suppose that there are probably very few midwesterners, middle-aged and older, who do not have at
                    least a few memories of the House of David in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>

                    </placeName>. For my mother, a native of Grand Haven, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, it is a charming recollection of several Saturday afternoons spent at the
                    community's amusement park. For my father, who grew up in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Holland</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName>, it is a series of action-filled stories about the prowess of the
                    community's bearded baseball players as they barnstormed across this part of the country
                    taking on all comers. From my own perspective, the athletic image is also most vivid, but by the
                    time that I got to see bearded shortstops and long-haired first basemen, all of the
                    community's operations had fallen on hard times. Indeed, as Robert S. Fogarty points out in
                    graphic detail, by the mid-1920s the House of David had become the subject of several state
                    government investigations and legal actions which tended to make midwesterners forget
                    merry-go-rounds and well-hit line drives and to remember lurid tales of strange sexual practices.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Righteous Remnant</hi> Fogarty, who teaches history at Antioch College and is
                    currently editor of the <hi rend="i">Antioch Review</hi>, makes the first scholarly attempt to
                    assess the historical importance of this religious communal Society within the larger context of an
                    Anglo-Israelite millennia1 tradition that he traces <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-078-3-075"/> back to
                    seventeenth-century <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. His case is a convincing one. Beginning with a well-written introductory chapter
                    entitled "Prophetic Tradition," Fogarty succeeds in placing the founders of the
                    House of David, Benjamin and Mary Purnell, in a line of prophets who reqeived special impetus from
                    the career of the late-eighteenth-century English mystic Joanna Southcott. Indeed, the religious
                    leap from Southcott's preaching to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> Harbor in 1903, the year that the Purnells established their Zion in southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, is not very great at all—at least not for the one thousand believers who
                    signed the House of David compact between 1903 and 1930, people convinced that the
                    Purnells' "kingdom" was the place for the elect to assemble. As Fogarty
                    puts it, "Benjamin Purnell's spiritual empire … [would] create and
                    sustain its earthly dimension with a skillful blend of evangelism, entertainment, hard work, prayer,
                    and maybe just some sex now and then" (p. 41).</p>
            <p>During this twenty-seven-year period the House of David was certainly a "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> Harbor," as the author indicates in the book's best chapter. Here in
                    this flourishing <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> port city, a center for the expanding
                    fruit-growing economy of the entire region, the Purnells and their Israelites, as the
                    community's members were known, established a celibate, communal Society whose members
                    exchanged their worldly goods for the promise of eternal salvation.</p>
            <p>From an economic perspective the House of David was a marked success. Income from farms, a canning
                    company, and an amusement park contributed to the community's prosperity. In the years
                    after World War I, however, stories told by defectors about oppressive conditions in the Society,
                    group marriages, financial malpractice, and, most significantly, charges of sexual misconduct
                    directed against Benjamin Purnell, resulted in a long-drawn-out series of legal actions against the
                    community and its founders. By the late 1920s Purnell was dead of tuberculosis, and the
                    colony's members had split into two factions, one led by Mary Purnell until her death in
                    1953. In the early 1980s the two factions, with a combined membership of fifty, still survive.</p>
            <p>Rather than leaving the reader with the remnant of the remnant, Fogarty concludes with a brief essay
                    in which he attempts to tie in the House of David with more recent examples of this unique form of
                    Social compact, including David Berg's Children of God and Jim Jones's erratic
                    career, which took him from Lynn, Indiana, to the jungles of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gy">Guyana</country>
                    </placeName>. When seen from this perspective, the Purnells and their followers do not seem as
                    strange as one might think.</p>

                    correspondence, and appropriate secondary sources. For the benefit of those readers who may wish to
                    delve deeper into the House of David's unique history or to compare it with that of other
                    religious colonies, he has added three appendixes that include important biographical and
                    theological data. The author has handled this range of material quite well, especially in building
                    his interpretive framework for the Purnells' community.</p>
            <p>The only error that stands out is a reference to "Grand Rapids Congressman M. L.
                    Hamilton" (M. L. on p. 94, R. L. on p. 97!) who is actually E. L. Hamilton from Niles,

                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> Harbor. Congressman Hamilton also fails to appear in the index, which seems to have
                    been thrown together as an afterthought. These are minor caveats about a book that certainly adds
                    only more luster to Fogarty's reputation as one of our best authorities on American utopian
                    communities.</p>

                    </placeName> achieved this entertaining volume by requesting from its members recipes that would
                    reflect the ethnic variety of their state's past. Carefully avoiding the temptation to
                    include convenience-food concoctions among the ingredients, the result is four hundred basic dishes
                    that show the varied diet of the upper Midwest. Breads, meats, and desserts predominate, along with
                    the products of the state's farms and forests. North European and Yankee influences are
                    clear, but so are those of many minorities from native American to Oriental. Often retaining the
                    idiom of the contributors, the result is an interesting heritage cookbook.</p>
            <p>Hachten introduces this collection with a hundred-page essay on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s dietary heritage. She moves from the wilderness environment to modern times,
                    although the emphasis is upon the nineteenth century. Most of the nine chapters draw heavily upon
                    settler and traveler accounts from the Draper collections. Anecdotes, menus, folk wisdom, and ethnic
                        <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-078-3-077"/> memories predominate, although the author does a nice job
                    of evaluating the ways cookbooks themselves have standardized modern diet.</p>
            <p>Readers may be less pleased with the way Hachten bridges the gap between early and modern ideas of
                    food. Drawing heavily upon Draper's work, for example, the author spends an entire chapter
                    on folk medicine. It is a legitimate topic, given its foodstuff ingredients, but it is a topic
                    subsequently ignored in the recipe section. Other meals and dishes described in the early chapters
                    suffer the same fate. There is clearly much more that could be done with the history of midwestern
                    food, but this volume does serve as an informal, popular introduction.</p>

                    forty-seven and already wealthy when he and nine employees opened his mattress factory in 1875. By
                    1910, when he died, the Simmons Company employed nearly two thousand and had sales of $5
                    million. Charles W. Nash, the autodidactic <placeName>

                    made $29 million in 1928. Nash himself formed a "Ke-Nash-A' Social club
                    for his employees in 1920 but locked them out in 1933 for quibbling about wages. (Would a

            <p>Although numerous works consider the political turmoil of the 1890s, this study is one of only a few
                    that systematically evaluate Populism's development, its relationship with progressivism,
                    and its role in transforming the political system. Robert W. Cherny divides the years
                    1885–1915 into four periods with breaking points at 1890, 1896, and 1904. Each period is
                    discussed in two chapters. The first describes the issues, campaigns, and personalities; the second
                    includes a relatively sophisticated analysis of voting behavior and summaries of leadership and the
                    political system. Before 1890 Republicans dominated <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, affiliation was based on ethnocultural factors, and prohibition was the most divisive
                    issue. This system was substantially modified by the emergence of Populism—an economic
                    movement which cut across ethnocultural lines and was <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-078-3-079"/>
                    attractive to persons in poorer, rural areas. Populist support also had a pietist tinge, but, Cherny
                    astutely argues, this was largely because those poorer farmers who strongly opposed liquor control
                    remained wedded to the Democratic party.</p>
            <p>Populist-Democratic fusion became official policy in 1896, and this coalition of economic and
                    ethnocultural interests controlled <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> government until 1900. Renewed agricultural prosperity and agitation over prohibition
                    then led many poorer, pietist farmers back to the GOP. Republican ascendancy was short-lived,
                    however, for after 1905 the party split into competing factions. Democratic divisions were less
                    serious, and the Democrats' emphasis on economic and political reform, opposition to
                    moralistic legislation, and successful organization of old Populists began an era of Democratic
                    control lasting until 1918.</p>
            <p>Cherny closely examines the ancestry of progressivism in both major parties and the Progressive
                    party. In general, he finds that economic distress motivated supporters of Populism and of a faction
                    in each major party; that there was very little overlap in the leadership; and that Populist
                    economic proposals differed greatly from progressive emphasis on regulation of business and
                    individual behavior.</p>
            <p>Cherny's study is important and insightful, but its elements are not equally impressive. His
                    analysis of voting behavior is instructive; yet, his failure to consider turnout and his basic
                    reliance on county data (and not even from all counties) raise questions. Furthermore, while the
                    discussion of the 1880s considers religion, later analysis uses only ethnic variables. Finally,
                    although Cherny makes some worthwhile points about leadership and the political system, his analysis
                    is brief and largely superficial. These criticisms are caveats, however, not major objections, for
                    Cherny has demonstrated his primary points and written an important work.</p>

            <p>Though the Historical Records Survey (HRS) was one of the most popular relief programs designed by
                    the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Depression, it has received surprisingly little
                    attention from the historical profession. This neglect seems especially curious since the project
                    was intended <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-078-3-080"/> to salvage and make accessible a vast body of
                    public records presumably of great interest and importance to historians. The American Historical
                    Association established a Public Archives Commission as early as 1899 in response to concern about
                    the treatment of public records; yet, the HRS and the work it achieved have been virtually ignored
                    since 1942. The appearance <hi rend="i">of</hi> Burl Noggle's essay on the HRS in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> is therefore a hopeful sign that interest among historians in this program is on the
                    rise.</p>
            <p>The Historical Records Survey was formally established in January, 1936, as an agency of the Federal
                    Writers' Project (FWP), one of four arts projects sponsored by the Works Progress
                    Administration (WPA). HRS gained separate status from FWP in November, 1936. Its purpose was
                    twofold. First, it was to provide jobs for white-collar workers, 85 percent of whom had to be on the
                    relief rolls. Second, it was to locate, preserve, organize, inventory, and make accessible the
                    public records of state and local governments. It accomplished both these aims, according to Noggle,
                    rather admirably. In its six-year existence, it gave work to several thousand unemployed, salvaged
                    countless records, and produced almost two thousand publications, mostly inventories of municipal,
                    county, and state archives. It did so, moreover, without the controversy that surrounded the other
                    arts projects. This was possible in part because HRS, maintains Noggle, was a manifestation of the
                    cultural regionalism "that coursed through American culture and scholarship in the
                    1930s" (p. 54).</p>
            <p>HRS units were established in all forty-eight states plus <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>. One of the best and most successful of these units, according to Noggle, was the one
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>. It produced "some of the best county inventories ever published" (p.
                    56). To demonstrate this point Noggle includes in a sixty-page appendix selected contents from the
                        <hi rend="i">St. Bernard Parish Inventory</hi>, published in December, 1938. A review of these
                    excerpts does indeed confirm Noggle's judgment as to the quality of the inventories, or at
                    least this inventory, produced by <placeName>

            <p>Noggle's essay is brief (only seventy-five pages), perhaps too brief for the goals he has
                    set for himself; namely, to offer a case study of a New Deal relief program and to suggest how this

                    suffers from a lack of breadth and scope. The narrative focuses too narrowly on the
                    program's administration and administrators and not enough on its operation and <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-078-3-081"/> its workers. It is the traditional view of history from the top. The
                    reader is left wondering who were the people who salvaged and inventoried the records, how did they
                    go about their work, how did they look upon their work, and whak became of them when the program
                    fell victim to the war effort. As a case study, therefore, Noggle's essay is incomplete;
                    hence, it is only partly successful.</p>
            <p>Noggle succeeds more fully in communicating the state of mind among historians and others toward the
                    study of American history in the 1930s. The HRS county studies, along with the FWP state studies,
                    enjoyed a large measure of popularity, according to Noggle, because they were a manifestation of the
                    growing interest among citizens in defining and evaluating what it was to be an American,
                    particularly in the face of the threats of economic collapse and fascism. The public records of
                    America's past were certainly critical to this evaluation process, and Noggle makes this
                    point well.</p>
            <p>In addition to the essay and the appendix, the book contains a brief but helpful bibliographical
                    note; regrettably, it does not contain an index. The author has produced a very thoughtful and
                    well-researched study, one, it is hoped, that will inspire similar efforts in other states.</p>

            <p>Few presidents, before or since, have seized the public imagination as much as Andrew Jackson.
                    Generations of some of the best historians in America have used their talents to explain Old
                    Hickory's influence. Now, Robert V. Remini, a leading Jackson scholar, proposes a major
                    reinterpretation of his subject's life. In this second volume of a planned trilogy, he
                    advances the story over the ten-year period from Jackson's retirement as governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> in 1822 through his reelection as president.</p>
            <p>The central theme of the book is the conflict between corruption and liberty in America. By
                    corruption, says Remini, Jackson and his supporters meant not only venality, but misuse of
                    government power against freedom. Indeed, the author contends, James Monroe's
                    administration "was perhaps one of the most corrupt in the early history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 15). <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-078-3-082"/> Instead of the Era of Good
                    Feelings, the period ought to be called the Era of Corruption. From the president and the Cabinet
                    down to officials in the states, there were shocking revelations of malfeasance in government, which
                    angered and frightened honest people. Over and over Remini hammers at his thesis, and in
                    overstressing it he makes it dubious. The election of 1824 was a struggle over "liberty,
                    public virtue, and centralized power in the federal government" (p. 80); Jackson's
                    victory four years later affirmed the public's "demand for the restoration of
                    morality and virtue to civic life, and a reform of those practices that had corrupted officials,
                    expanded government, and endangered freedom" (p. 148). Other issues—the bank,
                    internal improvements, the tariff, even slavery—Remini believes were secondary. Whether
                    the Era of Good Feelings was as corrupt, or the Jacksonians as virtuous, as Remini concludes is open
                    to challenge. After all, whereas John Quincy Adams's Tobias Watkins absconded with
                    $7,000 from the Treasury, Jackson's collector of customs at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, Samuel Swartwout, made off with over a million.</p>
            <p>This is an interesting and important book. Remini has benefited from the advances in Jacksonian
                    scholarship since publication of Marquis James's two-volume biography and Arthur
                    Schlesinger, Jr.'s <hi rend="i">Age of Jackson</hi>. In addition to the expanded secondary
                    literature, the author has profitably used the documentary collections now available, especially the
                    Jackson papers at the Hermitage.</p>
            <p>The most unfortunate aspect of the volume is its prose. Remini obviously wants to establish rapport
                    with the reader through a conversational style. He achieves that, but at the cost of craftsmanship
                    and grace in his writing. It seems unnecessary, for Remini is ordinarily a very fine writer. Despite
                    this, <hi rend="i">Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Freedom</hi> is a valuable contribution
                    to Jacksonian historiography.</p>

            <p>Gilbert C. Fite's volume is one in a series on <hi rend="i">Minorities in Modern
                    America</hi>, edited by Warren F. Kimball and David Edwin Harrell, Jr. In discussing the transition
                    of farming activity from majority to minority status in the American economy, primarily since 1920,
                    the author focuses on the productivity <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-078-3-083"/> factors which led to
                    this change and the efforts by farmers and their political spokesmen to counteract these forces.
                    While his approach is essentially that of an institutional historian, he is concerned, perhaps
                    fundamentally, by the shifting national priority perceptions evidenced in the growing dominance of
                    consumer interests during the past twenty years. His somewhat startling conclusion is that,
                    "In all likelihood, the nation's agrarian heritage will lose most of its
                    significance and meaning within another generation" (pp. 240–41).</p>
            <p>Fite has directed his survey primarily to the general reader, rather than to specialists in
                    agriculture, economics, politics, or agricultural history. He presents an excellent synthesis which
                    academicians, also, may find highly useful in surveying overall trends of agricultural development
                    and governmental policy relating to it. His first two chapters afford chronological and regional
                    background summaries of the setting as small-farm America moved out of the "Golden
                    Era" that ended with World War I. The body of the text centers upon the subsequent agrarian
                    organizational effort in pursuit of governmental assistance, the legislative relief programs as
                    revised to date, the management changes that marked the survival of commercial and agribusiness
                    operators while more traditionally diversified competitors were squeezed out, and finally the
                    "boom-bust" experience of the 1970s, which led the less than 5 percent of the
                    population remaining in agriculture to hone, through "tractorcades," new skills in
                    minority, special interest politics.</p>
            <p>The author finds that the power of farmers through the period of mounting crisis has remained
                    "fragmented not only among commercial producers, but between large farmers and small
                    part-time operators" (p. 241). Increasingly, also, they have felt a closer identity with
                    the interests of business than with those of labor. For a century or longer, however, they have
                    derived their strongest support from the mystique of rural ideals and value systems cherished by a
                    Society that no longer had "to make a living on the farm" (p. 238). What will be
                    the effect, Fite queries, as those emotions and traditions fade?</p>
            <p>Fite is too sound an economic historian to discountenance the trend toward commercial viability, but
                    his personal sentiments are seldom far removed from the tenets he denominates as
                    "agricultural fundamentalism." He defends agricultural colleges in their emphasis
                    upon farm productivity on the ground that they "never viewed their role as that of a Social
                    agency" (p. 187) to aid small farmers in making a living; yet he argues <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-078-3-084"/> that "different tax, credit, and price-support policies
                    … a generation earlier" might have retarded the concentration of farm ownership
                    evident today (pp. 220–21). He repeatedly laments that "farmers did not possess
                    that most basic right in business of being able to set the price of their product to cover costs and
                    also leave something for labor and return on investment" (p. 236). He never recognizes that
                    generations of marginal businessmen in all lines of endeavor have been driven out of the competitive
                    market for want of the same "basic right."</p>

            <p>According to Lee Soltow and Edward Stevens, the common school was a potent force in reducing
                    illiteracy and promoting Social mobility in nineteenth-century America. Together with newspaper
                    editors and a wide range of publishers, whose livelihood presupposed a literate citizenry, educators
                    prepared youth for a world increasingly dominated by print. Even though Horace Mann and other
                    reformers exaggerated the economic benefits of becoming literate, illiteracy soon became a
                    Socioeconomic handicap. By 1870 illiterates could still rise economically, but "the chances
                    of greater upward mobility were better for the literate person" (p. 194); hence, schooling
                    was neither irrelevant nor inconsequential.</p>
            <p>In tracing the rise of literacy and common schooling, the authors synthesize a diverse body of
                    secondary literature and present a considerable amount of original research. Few historians will
                    quarrel with the argument that religious values stimulated literacy in colonial America, that the
                    founding fathers lauded education for its civic potential, or that common-school reformers shared a
                    world view shaped by evangelical Protestantism. Even some of the sophisticated quantitative analyses
                    in this volume produce predictable conclusions: that wealthier people owned more books than the poor
                    and that population concentration greatly enhanced and nurtured literacy.</p>
            <p>One of the most enlightening sections of the book examines how literacy was actually transmitted in
                    the schools. The authors skillfully survey reading, writing, and spelling in the <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-078-3-085"/> nineteenth-century school, and they conclude that many children who
                    regularly attended were literate in reading and writing by age nine. As schools became the major
                    agency for the promotion of literacy by midcentury, they therefore assumed greater significance in
                    preparing youth for adult responsibilities. However perilous the practice has been historically,
                    employers increasingly used level of school attendance as a guide to actual academic competence.
                    Schooling gradually became a convenient way to sort children for occupational roles. For those who
                    received less formal education than others—whether because of family responsibilities or
                    other variables related to residence or personal background—the schools must have seemed
                    to be one more impediment to success in America. By analyzing a diverse array of historical
                    materials—such as estate inventories and census materials—Soltow and Stevens
                    have produced a well-written and closely reasoned volume that will become a standard source in the
                    history of American education. They have successfully highlighted the positive role of schooling in
                    promoting Social mobility without overlooking the persistent inequalities that pervaded both school
                    and Society.</p>
