				<div2 type="section">
					<head rend="center">CHRIST'S CREDENTIALS</head>

					<p><hi rend="b">W</hi>HEN a man puts forth extraordinary claims on his own behalf or makes
						extraordinary promises, we have a right to demand his credentials before we place our
						health, or our property, or our valuables, in his care. We act upon this common-sense
						precaution every day of our lives. Why should we not do so when it comes to so
						portentous a question as our soul's health here and its destiny hereafter?</p>
					<p>There is all the difference in the world between an egoist and an egotist. Egoism is
						self-reliance; egotism is self-conceit. With reverence be it said that Jesus Christ was
						the most colossal egoist the world has ever known. He claimed for himself more and
						uttered more colossal promises than any other character in history. In fact, the Four
						Gospels are but a succession of gigantic I's. In his best and longest recorded
						discourse--that swan song, uttered on the night of his betrayal--we find six hundred and
						fifty-eight personal pronouns, and of them one hundred and thirty-seven in the first
						person singular. Here are a few specimens of his egoism: "I am the life of the world."
						"I am come that ye may have life and have it more abundantly." "He that believeth in me
						shall never die." "I will raise you up at the last day." "I will come in the last day
						and judge the world." "I am the way, the truth and the life." "Whosoever shall drink of
						the water <pb id="VAB8208-004" n="4"/> that I shall give, the same shall be a well of
						water springing up into everlasting life." What amazing promises or pretensions are
						these! Which are they--promises or pretensions? If promises, who, short of a God, could
						utter them, without the most colossal self-conceit? No sane person has ever attempted
						it.</p>
					<p>If we examine his teachings, we shall find that unlike all other known teachers in this
						world, he never reasoned or argued. His final and only authority is and was, "I say unto
						you." Of no other teacher can it be said that his death made any difference whatever in
						the system he taught. The death of Plato added nothing to his teachings; and so with
						Socrates, Newton, Kant, Hegel and all the combined wisdom of the world. But in Christ's
						case all this is reversed. But for that third day after his death the Christian
						religion, with its 200,000,000 living adherents and its nineteen hundred years of
						consecutive history, would have had no existence. The Saturday after his murder the
						heresy endorsed by him was completely stamped out. His disciples had all scattered and
						came to the conclusion that he who had failed to exert his professed power at this
						supreme crisis of his life was rightfully shunned. "He saved others, himself he could
						not save." So that I am entirely correct in saying that the Christian religion is wholly
						dependent upon the personality and the works of its great author. Take from that
						personality the miracle, and it all sinks into mere ethics and takes its chances. with
						the other innumerable ethical systems of the world.</p>
					<p> We must not lose sight of the distinction between ethics and religion, between
						teaching and incarnation, <pb id="VAB8208-005" n="5"/> between wisdom and worship,
						between philosophy and life. Ethics are indispensable; they teach us to regulate our
						relations with each other individually and collectively. But ethics are not religion.
						Religion teaches us of God, of death and of the other mighty mysteries which surround us
						and which are beyond the reaches of our souls. Teaching is indeed indispensable, but
						Christ was a great deal more than a teacher. He was an incarnation and his miracles are
						the evidences of it. Here is where a vital mistake is being made when it is claimed that
						our Saviour is to be judged solely as a teacher. Take away his miracles and this claim
						is true. Reject his miracles, and as already remarked, you reduce him to the level of
						Socrates, Bacon and other of the world's great teachers. Philosophy plus the miracles
						becomes religion; religion minus the miracles, dwindles into philosophy. Hence the
						persistent assault upon miracles. Discredit them and the end is come, for thus you
						reduce religion to philosophy.</p>
					<p>W<hi rend="sc">hat</hi>, then, are the evidences upon which rest these astounding and enormous claims of
						our Saviour? Why do we feel that it is perfectly just that he asks us to surrender to
						him that supreme jewel of our souls--our worship? Christ presents us with three great
						credentials: His Miracles, his Message, and himself, the Messenger. In theological
						language these credentials are often called, the works, the words and the world made
						flesh. Let us consider each of them in their order.</p>
					<p>WHAT is a miracle? For upon Christ's sixty-five miracles rest his claim to worship and
						his promises to be our deliverer here from sin and hereafter from death. <pb
							id="VAB8208-006" n="6"/> A miracle is not something contrary to nature. The term
						supernatural, implies an acquaintance with nature that all the wisdom of the world does
						not possess. To the African king it seemed impossible that at certain seasons of the
						year people walked and great burdens were carried upon the surface of water. Ice to him
						was supernatural. We are fast approaching the time when an occult science now dimly
						recognized but not yet christened or named, will work havoc with our physics. The
						phenomena of spiritualism, table tipping and writing without hands, the approaches to
						this new science, are well established facts, so that we will be greatly misled if we
						adopt this old but faulty definition of a miracle. A better definition is that a miracle
						is something contrary to uniform and universal experience; that is as far as it is safe
						or necessary to go in the way of definition. The theory of miracles is absolutely
						perfect. If we believe in God and that he possesses supreme power over his creation,
						then the terse sentence, "With God all things are possible," dispenses with all
						theoretical difficulties. But even with this mental difficulty solved, the old question
						still remains, "How can you prove your miracle?"</p>
					<p>David Hume, with unsurpassed acuteness, pointed out that the negative of universal
						experience is infinitely greater than the affirmative of the few individual witnesses
						whose testimony was delivered nineteen hundred years ago. It is not impossible that
						water should run up hill, but who ever saw it and saw it with such means of impartial
						observation that we should be willing, upon his or her or their testimony, to set aside
						this universal <pb id="VAB8208-007" n="7"/> law of gravitation? This argument is
						exceedingly strong. But let us face the question squarely by taking for our text the
						most difficult to prove of all our Saviour's miracles--His birth without an earthly
						father. In the economy of life, as well speak of a man born without a mother as of one
						born without a father. No one could possibly know the actual facts concerning Christ's
						paternity, except the Virgin Mary, and she had every possible motive in self-defense to
						tell the story she did, concerning the fatherhood of her son. If Christ had an earthly
						father, then Mary was in the eyes of all Bethlehem a forever disgraced girl and a
						dishonored wife. Here, then, upon the slender word of a hitherto obscure Hebrew girl,
						rests the beginning of the structure Christianity. These considerations justify the
						assertion that the miraculous birth of our Saviour is the most difficult of proof of all
						his wonders--far more difficult than his resurrection; for to this last fact there were
						five or six hundred witnesses, whereas to the former there could not possibly be in the
						order of things but a single witness, his mother. And yet we believe this unspeakably
						sweet story of our Saviour's miraculous birth and its surroundings. Nor is this belief a
						mere sentiment or a cunningly devised fable, but rests upon a solid foundation. After
						years of anxious examination I believe that the Virgin's story is true. Why? Because it
						is so powerfully corroborated.</p>
					<p>First. This child so marvelously born without earthly father, thirty years afterwards
						proved himself to be ruler of the powers of Nature and ruler over Life and Death.
						Although he was most cruelly murdered, yet he could <pb id="VAB8208-008" n="8"/> not be
						holden of the grave. Upon a thousand occasions, only sixty-five of which have gone into
						his biography, he proved himself what he claimed to be--supernatural. Every one of these
						miracles corroborates the one under discussion by a line of circumstances that no lawyer
						would, for a moment, dare to overlook.</p>
					<p>Second. He introduced a code of teaching (soon to be examined) which is as wonderful as
						his work. The teaching corroborates the miracle and the miracle corroborates the
						teaching. These considerations must not be overlooked in determining the question of the
						truth or the untruth of the story of the Virgin Mary.</p>
					<p>Third. A mighty historical movement started with his birth, which rests upon the
						truthfulness of his mother's story, and which has changed the face of the best half of
						the globe. Besides, the founding of a great religion is a worthy occasion for a series
						of miracles such as Christ wrought. It was an occasion that justified prodigies and
						warrants our accepting them.</p>
					<p>Fourth. Then we must not forget the dignity and "sweet reasonableness" of the
						sixty-five miracles which are recorded in the Four Gospels. Not one of them, save
						perhaps the swine miracle, were unworthy or undignified. The majority of them were
						miracles of healing and labors of love. This is really the differentiating point between
						the true and the false miracle; between the ecclesiastical as distinguished from the
						evangelical. Some of the Church miracles recorded in the Old Testament are so childish,
						that we instinctively recognize their legendary character. For example, the revival of a
						dead man by coming in contact with the bones of the Prophet Elisha. Clearly this is a
						legend.</p>



					<pb id="VAB8208-009" n="9"/>

					<p>Fifth. The most powerful institution the world has ever seen, and which has had
						nineteen hundred years of historic unity, sprang up concurrent with and is based upon
						this miracle of our Saviour's birth, as told by his mother. It is impossible that so
						many of the world's greatest spirits and acutest intellects should be misled by a mere
						legend.</p>
					<p>Sixth. Did you ever stop to think about what a powerful, almost irresistible,
						corroboration of the miracle of our Saviour's resurrection is the present Christian
						Sabbath? For nearly nineteen centuries, fifty-two times a year, we are reminded that not
						only was light created on the first day of the week, but that within a few weeks after
						his death, the old Jewish seventh-day Sabbath was abandoned and the first-day Sabbath
						substituted in its place as a perpetual memorial of his greatest miracle. Was this
						miracle a mistake? Was it a product of over-wrought imagination and over-hot credulity?
						It is impossible that such a witness-stone erected within a month of the miracle itself
						and by so many eye-witnesses, and kept in its integrity now for so many centuries,
						should be a mistake.</p>
					<p>But there is another proof of the truth of our Saviour's miracles which is more than
						corroboration. Strangely enough, this proof can not be put into words. It is the <hi
							rend="i">felt proof</hi> that must be experienced by each individual to be fully
						comprehended; that glad, joyful assent of a loving and grateful heart to Christ's
						divinity. It is that gratitude, love and reverence which made doubting Thomas, after he
						had placed his hands in the spear and nail prints, exclaim, "My Lord and my God! " <pb
							id="VAB8208-010" n="10"/> and which brought forth for the relief of all the dreary
						doubts of the next twenty centuries the exquisite words, "Because thou hast seen, thou
						hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen and yet believe." For after all, the
						great fact remains that spiritual truths can only be spiritually discerned. The
						approaches to the heavenly vision are through the heart and not through the head. We do
						not know why this is so. We can not understand why this Cinderella of the affections
						sitting humbly in the ashes, should be chosen, and proud Philosophy with her jewels and
						gewgaws waiting in the parlor for the king's son, should be ignored. But if God sees fit
						to come to us through the heart instead of the head, shall we say Him nay? In the realm
						of politics and public affairs, we have a similar phenomenon. What could statesmanship
						do divorced from patriotism? But patriotism is only an emotion. Statemanship is confined
						to the very few. Patriotism belongs to the toiling millions. What would become of the
						human family if its corner-stone was learning instead of love? Besides we must remember
						that the vast majority of the human family do not reason, or if reason they only reason
						after a rudimentary fashion. We do not want a religion for the choice and elect few, but
						for the great toiling and moiling many. The poor washerwoman in her suds and rags
						singing-- <q rend="blockquote">
							<lg>
								<l>"Jesus, Saviour, pilot me</l>
								<l>Over life's tempestuous sea"--</l>
							</lg>
						</q> may not be able to give any sufficient reason for her faith, but that faith is not,
						therefore, credulity or superstition.</p>



					<pb id="VAB8208-011" n="11"/>
					<p>The miracle is a part of the environment of the Master. And love is the truest and
						highest interpreter of both. Hence, the <hi rend="i">felt proof</hi> of the reality and
						truth of the miracle as part and person of Master and Message, is the best of all
						proofs, although it can not be put into language. When Mr. Ingersoll said: "Having been
						born but once, I can not believe in miracles," he uttered a far greater truth than he
						comprehended. The soul that has been quickened by the divine life, gladly and easily
						accepts--nay, he can not do without--our Saviour's miracles, even though his intellect
						may reject many of the Old Testament wonders as ecclesiastical and man-made.</p>
					<p>Why are not the New Testament miracles the fairy tales of early Christianity? Or why
						are not our Saviour's miracles the products of the world's gratitude not essentially
						different from the myths which have grown around the memories of all great men? Myths
						are the wreaths with which we crown our dead heroes for the temple of Fame, as, for
						example, the legends about Washington, not yet a century dead. And as our Saviour placed
						the human family under greater obligations to himself than all the rest of the sons of
						men, therefore the myths woven around him are the most exquisite of which the world has
						ever dreamed. For the same reason we write any personal pronoun referring to Him with a
						capital letter. Why is not this argument sound? Because He had too many enemies and
						critics, and lived too much in the fierce, keen light of publicity, to allow the growth
						of hatchet stories about him. His miracles were not wrought (like Washington's <pb
							id="VAB8208-012" n="12"/> hatchet story) in a corner, but in Jerusalem in the midst of
						great crowds. Nor does the fact that the Four Gospels may not have been written for one
						hundred and fifty years afterwards, reduce them to traditions--the products of
						enthusiasm and credulity; for within a few years after his death we find Paul and the
						other disciples--eye-witnesses--recording in unmistakable terms his wonderful works.</p>
					<p>"But," says the objector, "Mohammed wrought miracles and so did Buddah." We reply: "So
						did Joseph Smith, so does the spiritualist of to-day. We do not believe them."
						"Christians sneer at all of them," so the critic affirms, "and altogether rightfully;
						but they stand essentially upon the same ground with those of our Saviour. If you
						believe in His miracles, why not believe in the miracles of the founders of all the
						world's great religions? When Niebuhr, fifty years ago, destroyed the old legends of
						Rome, he pointed the way to discrediting the miracles of our Saviour. Why should the
						Jews not have their legends as well as Greece and Rome?"</p>
					<p>For one, I am not at all disposed to belittle this argument, but to treat it fairly. It
						seems to me that there is one test which distinctly discredits both the miracles of
						Mohammed, and of Buddah and Mormonism. It is this: What message accompanied their
						so-called supernatural works? Was Mohammed's message to the world a divine message? Was
						that of Buddah or Joseph Smith divine? What revelation has spiritualism given us? Have
						any or all of them added to the Christianity of which they are outgrowths? For one, I am
						quite prepared to admit the many good and even grand things, <pb id="VAB8208-013" n="13"
						/> ethical and spiritual, to be found in the Koran, and I am glad to pay tribute to the
						wonderful character of Buddah, so justly called the Indian Saviour. But Mohammed was a
						warrior. His message, upon the whole, is a message of war. His religion was successful
						by virtue of the sword, rather than by its intrinsic merits, and since his death, it has
						held its own for twelve hundred years by force of a wonderfully skillful organization
						over semi-barbarous and easily governed peoples. Having seen something personally of the
						Mohammedan system, I am not disposed to either slur or slight it, much less do I
						undervalue its great contributions to the world's philosophy. John W. Draper, in his
						"History of Civilization in Europe," has not said a word too much in its favor. I only
						say that upon the whole its message does not prove the claim that it was introduced into
						the world by miracles. And so with the "Light of Asia" and the mild glory of his life as
						given by Sir Edward Arnold in his wonderful poem. Buddah's personal character merits all
						that has been said about him. Buddah's message has some beautiful things in it, but it
						is a message exclusively adapted to Oriental dreamers and rudimentary peoples. It could
						never possibly succeed with either the German or the Anglo-Saxon or the Slavic races.
						Giving it all its just dues it is not too much to say that Buddism begins nowhere and
						ends nowhere. I am disposed to think that we may justly term it a prepedeutic religion,
						the purpose of which is to conduct vast peoples upon and to a path which will ultimately
						end in Christianity. Besides, the miracles of Buddah are childish and grotesque. They
						will not for a moment <pb id="VAB8208-014" n="14"/> bear the test of common sense. It is
						not necessary to spend any time upon the miracles of Joseph Smith, much less upon
						table-tipping and slate-writing without hands.</p>
					<p>For one, I protest against robbing our Saviour of his power and leaving him simply as
						the apostle of love and good will.</p>
					<p>Also, I can not but protest against that spirit in the Church itself, and against that
						higher criticism which upon the whole, makes light of the reality of our Saviour's
						miracles. The pulpit is beginning to teach that our Saviour did not arise from the dead
						except in a spiritual sense. If so, will they kindly answer, What became of his body? If
						so, will they answer and explain how a spirit could eat bread and fish? Was the story of
						Thomas true? It seems to me that our Saviour's power is as vital a consideration and
						necessary an attribute as his love. In the great promise, "Able and willing to save all
						that come to him," can you, or dare you, omit the emphatic word "able" ? Do you not thus
						and thereby fritter away one of the mighty hopes that make us men? If Christ could not
						heal the diseases of the body; if he was baffled by the blind and the lame; if when he
						commanded the wind and the waves, "Peace, be still," the wind still howled and waves
						still rolled, how can he be trusted in his promises to cure the diseases of the soul? If
						he himself was holden of death and the grave, how could he fulfill the greater promise
						to raise us up at the last day?</p>
					<p>He must be a bold critic who would accuse our Saviour of dishonesty. Yet he certainly
						was dishonest and <pb id="VAB8208-015" n="15"/> an impostor if, when his first disciple,
						John the Baptist, about to face death and anxious to know whether he was mistaken or
						not, sent to him his messengers for proofs of his divinity, our Saviour replied, "The
						blind see and the lame walk," and no such thing ever occurred.</p>
					<p>That Christ believed in and constantly appealed to his miracles as proof of his
						divinity, can not be denied. Was he mistaken? Was he dishonest? Is the record
						untrustworthy? But here the question arises, If the poems of Homer, delivered long
						before the art of printing was invented, have come down to us in their integrity, and
						to-day we are reading the same Iliad and Odyssey that delighted the Greeks five hundred
						years before the age of Christ, how should we doubt the substantial accuracy of the Four
						Gospels? The destruction of our Saviour's miracles, is the destruction of Christianity.
						Impair his miracles, and in the same degree you impair Christianity. The reason why they
						are doubted inside of the Church is clear. Some of the Old Testament miracles are
						clearly man-made, or rather, ecclesiastical; and the inference follows swiftly, if so,
						why not those of the New Testament? Must they not all stand or fall together? But I
						protest. The story of Sampson and Goliah is not at all parallel with or like the story
						of Christ; neither is the raising of Samuel in any respect like the Resurrection of our
						Saviour. The tale of the two giants and the witch of Endor may be stricken out of the
						Old Testament without in the least impairing its message or detracting from its
						spiritual excellence and authority; while, if you reject the Resurrection as an actual
						fact, or even treat it as only spiritually <pb id="VAB8208-016" n="16"/> true, you take
						away or impair the corner-stone of the Christian Church.</p>
					<p>Do I seem to be too hard upon the Old Testament? I hope not. While parts of it seem to
						me unmistakably legendary, still as a whole it is as full of spirituality and the
						divine, as a June morning is full of music. No one can fail to notice the fact that from
						the start the Old Testament was a growing revelation. The Psalms are vastly in advance
						of the Pentateuch and the historic books, while the prophets are in advance of the
						Psalms.</p>
					<p>For years I have had a little book by my side, called "The Soul's Inquiries Answered."
						It consists of three passages for each day of the year, nearly eleven hundred in all; of
						these by actual count, seven hundred and seventy are from the Old, and only three
						hundred and thirty from the New Testament. It is a book of life--a book of devotion, and
						not a book of speculation or of theology. The Old Testament is a talk four thousand
						years long between man and God. In this little book I speak of, there are twenty-seven
						hundred and fourteen personal pronouns, purporting to have been uttered either by God
						speaking to the messenger (always a man be it remembered), or by the messenger
						addressing itself to the Deity. In the whole eleven hundred passages, there is only a
						single day with no personal pronouns. The Old Testament is like a gold mine or a diamond
						field. No one ever dreamed of finding gold disconnected from quartz or earthy matter; no
						one ever dreamed of finding diamonds except after a weary search. The gems and gold of
						the Old Testament are all there, but they are surrounded by earthy matter with <pb
							id="VAB8208-017" n="17"/> anthromorphisms, with the finger prints of the messenger who
						conveyed in human language the divine message.</p>
					<p>I am conceding by these considerations the extreme difficulty of proving a miracle,
						when we take into consid- eration the uniformity of the laws of nature and infirmity of
						human testimony. I am conceding that all the direct testimony of our Saviour's miracles
						came from interested parties. True, they sealed their testimony by their blood, but that
						does not change the fact that we have no account whatever of his wonderful works from
						contemporary sources outside of the Christian Church. Nevertheless, I am maintaining
						(and this pamphlet is written for that purpose) that these miracles are so corroborated
						by other matters, among which is the Message and the Master himself, and that they so
						fit in with what may not inappropriately be called the higher evidences of Christianity,
						that sincere belief in them is not as is claimed, an evidence of mental unsoundness;
						neither are they, as the Disciples at first characterized the woman's account of the
						Resurrection, "idle tales," nor even cunningly devised fables; but that they are words
						of truth and soberness.</p>

					<head rend="center">THE MESSAGE</head>

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> is sufficiently accurate for our purpose if we divide our
						Saviour's message into two kinds--Ethics and Religion. Ethics need no miracle for their
						support; they commend themselves to us without external and still less material aid.

					<p>"Take no thought for the morrow, but let the morrow take thought for the things of
						itself." "Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow, turn thou not
						away." "Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor." "He that loveth father or mother
						more than me is not worthy of me." "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray
						for them that despitefully use you." "Take the lowest seat in the synagogue." "When thou
						makest a feast, call in the poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind." "It is easier for
						a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
						heaven."</p>
					<p>Let us examine these imperatives for a moment and see how impracticable they are, human
						nature being what it is. I am not using any too strong terms when I say that they are
						the very romance of altruism. The commands, "Take no thought for the morrow," and "Give
						to him that asketh of thee and from him that would borrow turn thou not away," would,
						literally enforced, be the death of thrift, of prosperity, of wealth, and of
						civilization. It is impossible to have even a high grade of Christianity as the world is
						now constituted, without property. Without capital there could be no schools or churches
						or Christian missions. Wherever these maxims have been attempted in their literalness,
						there has invariably been retrogression and semi-barbarism, of which the dark ages are
						illustrations. In those ages the Church attempted to exist--I will not say, as seems to
						be the fact, by getting all the world's wealth <pb id="VAB8208-019" n="19"/> into their
						own hands, but by a system of semi-communism. The priests attempted to do without
						marriage or property and encouraged poverty by an elaborate system of doles which proved
						absolute failures. The Christian Church has completely abandoned the attempt to make
						practicable either of Christ's property maxims, but contents itself by diluting them and
						spiritualizing them; by saying that they refer to states of minds and internal
						dispositions--theories rather than conditions. In the place of enforcing these rules as
						our Saviour gave them, the Church is content with a generous and liberal disposition,
						and qualifies them so that the liberality shall not affect the donor's duty to his
						family and his neighborhood. As against these modifications and interpretations consider
						the third command, "Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor." If every rich man or
						every prosperous man should do as Christ commanded in this matter of charity, the world
						would be ruined and wealth destroyed and the poor not in the least benefited. If there
						is any lesson that the educated charity of to-day teaches, it is that indiscriminate
						giving--"giving to him that asketh"--would be the death of charity; quite as much so as
						indiscriminate lending--"from him that would borrow, turn thou not away"--would be the
						death of industry and thrift. Enforce either of these maxims and you fill the world with
						tramps and poorhouses; and so the Church comes again and says: "The meaning of this
						unmistakable command is not what it says, but what it does not say, namely: the
						inculcation of a constant spirit of charity and self-sacrifice." I will not go through
						the remainder of these commands one by one. I content <pb id="VAB8208-020" n="20"/>
						myself with saying, without any fear of successful contradiction, that they would be
						quite as destructive, human nature being what it is and what it always has been, in the
						domain of self-respect, of self-assertion, and of society, as the first three maxims,
						literally enforced, would be in the domain of property, prosperity and charity. What
						self-respecting man or woman would not resent a personal insult, such as a blow, or
						would tamely submit, when smitten on one cheek, to turning the other also? What father
						would do as Christ bids, when confronted with the dishonor of an innocent daughter? Even
						a Church minister would rebel at being made a cuckold. What disasters to society would
						the social command--"When thou makest a feast, call in the poor, the maimed, the lame
						and the blind"--if literally enforced, work? Suppose it was society's duty, when a
						social gathering was contemplated, to go out into the highways and hedges and invite in
						the tramps, the hoboes and the misfits, instead of our social equals: what would become
						of society? To ask the question is to answer it. So that I repeat, the Sermon on the
						Mount, <hi rend="i">literally</hi> construed, is the romance of altruism.</p>
					<p>But is this excessive and extreme altruism of the Master altogether a mistake? Clearly
						here we have a message from another world. We do not condemn these maxims in the least
						as ideals. Quite the contrary. For nineteen centuries this Sermon on the Mount has been
						and still is the world's delight and wonder. We only say in the present condition of
						humanity, its commands are unworkable. We delight to read and think about them, for so
						doing, we seem to hear the whir of angels' <pb id="VAB8208-021" n="21"/> wings and to
						breathe the atmosphere of heaven. Neither do we despair of their some time being the
						language and practice of this earth, even as they now are unquestionably the language
						and practice of heaven. Their excessive altruism as the world is now constituted, prove
						that our Saviour was not of this world but came "trailing clouds of glory from God who
						was his home." Besides we must remember that we are saved by our ideals, and that our
						ideals save us. If these maxims are not, in the present condition of humanity, workable,
						we need not and do not despair. They are good for that ultimate industrial and social
						state of things to which the world is slowly but steadily tending. Sometimes we think we
						see the beginning of the end of the present horrible competitive system, based upon the
						heartless generalities about the survival of the fittest, and the iron law of wages, and
						which fills the world with either the very rich or the very poor, and for which the
						Church (to its shame, be it said) has no words of cure and very little of protest. Just
						how the end to the brutal industrial system which to-day dominates the world will come,
						we do not know any more than forty years ago we knew or could guess how American slavery
						would end. But as forty years ago the American people by instinct knew that this Union
						could not exist half slave and half free and the end of slavery was approaching, so we
						by instinct to-day know that somehow or other the present commercial system, which robs
						alike both God and man, will ultimately and in a few centuries not far distant, be
						superseded by some other system, perhaps co-operation, which will approximate <pb
							id="VAB8208-022" n="22"/> at least to Christ's commands of doing unto others as you
						would be done by.</p>
					<p>Be these things as they may, no one would ask for a moment that these delightful
						imperatives of Jesus Christ with their unattainable altruism be stricken out of the
						Gospels. Just as the inaccessible Andes and Himalayas keep the air beneath their golden
						and rosy thrones--the air which we all breathe--sweet and pure and full of health, so
						with these delicious ideals--industrial, altruistic and social--which Christ brought
						from heaven and put into the Sermon on the Mount. We gladly recognize them as part of
						his angelic birth message, "Peace on earth and good will towards men."</p>
					<p>But Christ had a message of infinitely greater importance than his industrial or social
						messages. Let us turn to it. The world is buried in mystery. Whence came man? Whence
						came matter? Whence came life? Wither go we after life's transient dream? What is sin?
						Can it be cured? Is God our ignorance dressed up in terms of human experiance, or is he
						a Person, invisible indeed, yet for all that, "closer to us than breathing, nearer than
						hands and feet?" What is personality? What is a spirit? Does the grave end all? Is the
						tomb a wall or a gate? When we approach any or all of these mysteries, we find ourselves
						groping in the dark. Our religion is strangely mixed up with and expressed in terms of
						human experiences.</p>

					<p>Every earnest, thoughtful soul studying the problems of revelation, must sometime or
						other face this agonizing question: "Does not man make his own religion, just as he
						makes his science, his medicine and his government, by the slow, plodding methods of
						experience? Do they not all spring from very small beginnings? Is revelation anything
						else than the gradual development of the divine within us through the long and weary
						centuries, and by an evolutionary process slowly working its way onward and upward? Do
						not all religions spring from a common root? Is not the term 'false religion' a
						contradiction upon its face, inasmuch as any religion is a search after God? Was Christ
						any other than the Supreme Soul of all the world who reached the highest point in this
						universal search for God? Did not even he make an occasional mistake, or, rather, has he
						not been in places misreported?" I am not wise enough to attempt to answer these last
						two questions, and yet they must be answered some day, and such answers will constitute
						the religious battleground of the twentieth century. Unsettled questions have no respect
						for the world's peace. It must be apparent to the slightest observation that we have to
						think in terms of human experience. Hence, these anthropomorphisms which continually get
						themselves into the records of Revelation and get themselves believed and substituted
						for the voice of God, whereas they are only the creation of humanity. Grant that all
						this is so. And still, back of the hand that writes the Book, or carves the marble, or
						paints the canvas, or writes the inspired hymn, or builds the cathedral, or organizes
						the <pb id="VAB8208-024" n="24"/> hierarchy, or formulates the dogma, or thrills the
						organ keys, is that inexpressible Reality--that something "the like of which was never
						yet on sea or land"--always struggling and in time getting itself expressed, even though
						imperfectly and with human shortcomings. What is this something except the Divine
						Spirit, of which the Church is only an incident and instrument? For one, I can not and
						do not doubt the reality of God and of His communication with and life in the human
						soul. Nor do I doubt that one of the methods of such communication in the sacred
						Scriptures. This life of God planted in the individual soul and the race is religion.
						And of this life and love, the best record the world has is the New, and the second
						best, the 0ld Testament. And our Saviour is unmistakably its greatest source and its
						fullest fountain, so that his heavenly words are literally true, "Whosoever shall drink
						of this water that I shall give him, the same shall be a fountain within him springing
						up into everlasting life."</p>
					<p>It is impossible, in the nature of things, that man should know God directly; quite as
						much so as that the unveiled human eye should look at the sun in his midday human
						brightness. When a man of three score talks to a child of ten years, it is the man who
						drops fifty of his years and talks in the child's language. So with Revelation: Christ
						came to establish a medium of communication between man and God. He expressed God's
						thought and will through that best of all epistles--a human life--</p>

					<p>Let us see what Christ's Message is and was in this higher and highest world of
						mysteries--the world of spirits.</p>
					<p>Christ taught--and no experienced man or woman of the world but instinctively
						recognizes the truth of his teaching--the fact of universal (but not total) depravity.
						The very best of us are imperfect and, perhaps, corrupt. The universal verdict of the
						saints of this world recognizes this fact in their unbroken refrain: "Our righteousness
						is as filthy rags." Our Saviour teaches that he came to restore to humanity its lost
						spiritual and moral life. Now, this life is something more than altruism. It is (so he
						teaches) the indwelling of himself and his words and example in the human heart. How?
						Through and by his Holy Spirit. He held himself out as a part of our spiritual life and
						as the cure for sin. Whoever absorbs the Christ Spirit, or, in his metaphorical words,
						"Eateth his flesh and drinketh his blood," has a fountain within himself springing up
						into everlasting life. Does this sound like what the Science of to-day calls altruism?
						It does not. It is a message, and a message which his Church, in its halting and
						imperfect way, professes to teach. <pb id="VAB8208-026" n="26"/> And as the most
						effective way of teaching it, the Church makes Christ an object of worship. This Spirit
						of his, dwelling in the human heart, striving against and ultimately overcoming sin, was
						the burden of his teaching.</p>
					<p>But redemption from sin by no means exhausts our Saviour's spiritual message. He brings
						immortality as well as life to light. His and our life in the next world is a far
						greater revelation, or, rather, is a necessary supplement to the life that he brings to
						light in this world. Here in this world, our Saviour's message is, that sin and evil are
						disciplinary and given for some inscrutable reason "to work out a far greater weight of
						glory" in the endless life hereafter. John Fiske, the author of Cosmic Philosophy, and
						his co-laborers in the noble domain of science, teach that evil is a necessary part of
						the divine order. We can not have light without shade; heat without cold; north without
						south; and so in the analogy of this unchanging law of opposites, he and they teach that
						we can not have virtue without vice, good without bad, holiness without sin. This
						doctrine necessarily implies that in that heaven to which we all aspire, we shall be
						governed by the same law--which is directly contrary to Revelation. John Stuart Mills
						taught that sin was an anterior and an irreductible element existing in the nature of
						things, and that God, when He made the world, did the best that he could with existing
						circumstances, and is upon the whole entitled to our sympathy that he did not make a
						better world. Now, our Saviour uses an altogether different tone: "It must needs be that
						offenses come, but woe unto that man by whom they come." The last half of this great
						Scripture is rather hard upon the theory <pb id="VAB8208-027" n="27"/> of Mr. Fiske and
						his co-laborers. Instead of being excused for committing sin by the irrevocable law of
						nature which he could not help (poor fellow), our Saviour says unmistakably: "Woe to him
						by whom offenses come." This disciplinary nature of sin necessarily implies an hereafter
						where all wrongs are to be righted. and the guilty are to receive their just desserts--a
						doctrine which our Saviour develops in no uncertain terms. Christ's teachings are no
						conclusions reached by long and subtle arguments, but unmistakable revelations. Here, as
						elsewhere, he speaks by authority. There is no tremor in his voice or hesitation in his
						manner when he says: "I go to prepare a mansion for you, and if I go I will come again,
						that where I am ye may be also." Who else except the Lord of life and of death could
						deliver such a message? Who else than one who made life, and whose foot is on the skull
						which he has made, could possibly say as he said, "Whosoever believeth upon me shall
						never die."</p>
					<p>I do not ignore, much less minimize, that tremendous background of mystery--eternal
						punishment--with which this noble Christian doctrine of personal immortality is so
						heavily handicapped. Our preachers give us the easy side and seldom or ever consider the
						difficulties in the Christian doctrine of the hereafter. For one I do not hesitate to
						say that I disbelieve with all the emphasis of my being, in eternal punishment. To be
						entirely frank, I do not believe that Jesus Christ ever taught it in the monstrous form
						that is put in his mouth--"And in hell he lifted up his eyes in torment," etc. "The
						smoke of whose torment goeth up forever and forever." If he taught this doctrine, it
						would be the most powerful <pb id="VAB8208-028" n="28"/> of all arguments ever put forth
						to prove that he was a man and only a man, and subject to the like mistakes of his
						brother-man. Granting that he said what is attributed to him, he certainly said
						something more that has not been reported, or said it in a sense that is not now
						understood, or the key to which has in some way been hopelessly lost.</p>
					<p>That there is an irreversible tendency in good and evil to separate and each take its
						own place, is one of the most obvious facts in the whole universe. That there is nothing
						in the practice of vice to ultimately turn it to virtue is equally plain. Clearly, the
						longer vice is practiced, the more vicious it becomes. But back of all these deep-seated
						tendencies in the nature of things, there shines, although somewhat clouded, the star of
						eternal hope. Life is divine. "In the image of God created he them," and nothing so
						created can be eternally lost or lost in eternal torments. The idea of revenge in the
						Divine Being has long since become the property of the moles and bats. Upon no principle
						of justice, human or divine, that I can conceive, can endless punishment for the
						imaginable sins of four score years, especially when we couple it with divine
						foreknowledge, be maintained.</p>
					<p>Mr. Ingersoll has said nothing too severe in condemnation of this monstrous libel upon
						the divine character. All the world's best thoughts and thinkers, at least of the
						nineteenth century, agree upon Tennyson's proposition: <q type="blockquote">
							<lg>
								<l>"That not one life shall be destroyed,</l>
								<l>Or cast its rubbish to the void,</l>
								<l>When God shall make the pile complete."</l>
							</lg>
						</q>
					</p>



					<pb id="VAB8208-029" n="29"/>


					<p>The foreknowledge of God is fatal, as it seems to me, to any successful justification
						of man's endless misery hereafter. No parent, unless unspeakably depraved and heartless,
						would bring children into the world knowing in advance that they would suffer agony to
						all eternity. Neither would any earthly parent ever dream of inflicting upon their
						offspring, born with defects of will and taints of blood, punishent so enormously
						disproportioned to the offense as endless torment for the sins of four-score years.
						"Nothing can be right in God that is wrong in man," says the poet Whittier. But this by
						no means excludes proper and just punishment hereafter. Without it for our shortcomings,
						the idea of rewards for our well doing would be an illusion. But what the measure of
						such punishment will be we know not, and must hold to the great interrogatory, "Will not
						the Judge of all the world do right?"</p>
					<p>Of all the mighty hopes that make us men, this personal immortality as taught by our
						Saviour; this sweet rest beyond when the storms of life are over, is the most consoling
						and inspiring. It would be unjust, however, to the great and noble intellects who have
						consecrated their grand powers to science for the last half century, but who reject our
						Bible as revelation, to say that they have given to the world no substitute for personal
						immortality. With noble self-negation they have presented to us in its place the
						immortality of the type as the highest end and aim of life. "It is career
						enough--immortality enough," say they, "to have found and lost your life in the service
						of your fellowman <pb id="VAB8208-030" n="30"/> and the elevation of humanity." "The
						individual withers, but the type is more and more." "It is enough that you have done a
						little work and benefited your race. Why ask for the selfishness of a personal existence
						hereafter? "George Eliot, the greatest woman of the nineteenth century, has grandly
						expressed this thought as well as this satisfaction in her noble hymn beginning with the
						words-- <q type="blockquote">
							<lg>
							<l>O! may I join the choir invisible;"</l>
								</lg>
						</q> but how poor and paltry is this aspiration when placed side by side with hymns the
						authors of which are so obscure that the world has never heard their names, but which
						are so full of inspiration of a personal immortality hereafter that they stir us as does
						the sound of far-off trumpets. Take in illustration this couplet: <q type="blockquote">
							<lg>
								<l>"We shall sleep, but not forever,</l>
								<l rend="t-1">There shall be a glorious dawn;</l>
								<l>We shall meet to part, no, never,</l>
								<l rend="t-1">On the Resurrection morn."</l>
							</lg>
						</q> Thus we see, even in poetry, how true is that great Scripture: "God hath chosen the
						weak things of this world to convey the things which are mighty." I do not think that
						this desire for personal immortality and to join our near and dear ones in the next
						world, as well as the wise and good of all ages, is only refined and subtle selfishness.
						An impersonal hereafter where, although we become once more a part of the elemental
						universe and "foam in the waves or sparkle in the stars," is after all, "a faith as
						vague as all unsweet." A thousand times more preferable is the new-fashioned <pb
							id="VAB8208-031" n="31"/> belief taught by science and called Conditional Immortality,
						and which is the application of evolution to our survival hereafter.</p>

					<head rend="center">CHRIST'S LAW OF SERVICE, AND THE<lb/> BROTHERHOOD OF HUMANITY</head>

					<p>A<hi rend="sc">LTHOUGH</hi> it is no part of this little essay to discuss Christ's
						ethical or political teachings, still I can not refrain from a word or two. "He that
						findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it,"
						is one of the lovely paradoxes of our Saviour's Message. He taught that the way to find
						life is to lose it for and in the service of others. This is the open secret of
						happiness. On the other hand, he taught that selfishness in the long run, even though
						never so successful, is death. "He that loveth not is dead." It seems to me that this
						law of Service could never have been taught as Christ taught it and organized it, by any
						one less than divine. How fundamental it is! What is prosperity (as we commonly accept
						the term) but accomplished selfishness, the result of which is, unless saved by a
						predominating mixture of altruism, the loss of the possessor's real life in the
						abundance of things possessed? Mere riches are the death of the soul. Half the time a
						fortune owns its owner, who stands in relation to it in no different light essentially
						than his ledger and safe. "How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of
						heaven." But the power of wealth is by no means the only way of killing off a soul by
						the abundance of its possessions, or <pb id="VAB8208-032" n="32"/> losing a life when
						apparently finding it. What is more heartless than promotion, either social, or
						political, or literary, as we know it, in ordinary cases? What an ever-widening and
						increasingly dangerous gulf is there between the so-called upper and lower classes! The
						heart of the social, political or literary self-seeker who has been crowned with
						promotion ultimately becomes, as a rule, colder and harder than the marble status or
						palace which his toiling constituents have erected in his honor, or permitted him to
						temporarily occupy. Look for a moment at the reverse of this great truth. Who are the
						happy people? To whom do the joys of life come in their highest and fullest measure?
						Those who serve. Labor is the greatest of all God's blessings. Activity is only another
						name for self-forgetfulness, and self-forgetfulness is the substratum upon which
						happiness rests. With profound instinct, the royal coat of arms of England, is crowned
						by the words "Ich Dien." It is one of the elementary truths of finance that the best
						possible investments are those which render the most and the cheapest service to the
						most people.</p>
					<p>Turn for one moment to another of Christ's political thoughts--the Brotherhood of
						Man--and we will find that it is the greatest ever uttered by any statesman. If man was
						created in the image of God, and if God is common Father, then all men are brothers. If
						all men are brothers, then this talk about higher and lower classes is absolute
						foolishness; worse, political idiocy. If all men are brothers, then this monstrous
						social and industrial system of ours, with palaces on the one end <pb id="VAB8208-033"
							n="33"/> and hovels at the other, is a bitter satire upon church, state and society.
						The most dangerous problem that now confronts us is the labor question. What business
						has any man, by virtue of his superior brain, to exploit the brain, muscle and
						intelligence of his fellow-man, his employes, in order that he may live in luxury at the
						expense of such employes? Was there ever such barbarity as the so-called iron law of
						wages to which we are slowly tending every day. We all recall Hood's "Song of the
						Shirt"-- <q type="blockquote">
							<lg>
								<l rend="ti-2">"Stitch! Stitch! Stitch!</l>

						</q>
					</p>

					<p>Our Saviour solved this labor problem completely and without reservation. The solution
						of it is as simple as the stars, or the laws of gravitation, or any other of the great
						facts of nature. "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." "Put yourself in
						his place," is all that is required to solve the question of the right and, let us hope,
						the ultimate relation of labor and capital. But the laborer must put himself in the
						capitalist's place and consider his risks, as well as the capitalist put himself in the
						laborer's place and consider his toil. No doubt labor is just as selfish as capital; no
						doubt labor is prone to imprudence, drink, dirt, ingratitude; still, for all that,
						capital has the <pb id="VAB8208-034" n="34"/> advantage and is equally selfish, and
						should remember the great command, "Inasmuch as ye have done it [or have not done it]
						unto the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it [or not done it] unto me."</p>

					<head rend="center">THE MASTER</head>

					<p>O<hi rend="sc">NE</hi> of the first things that strikes the attention of the student of
						the Master's life, looking at him from a human standpoint only, is his romantic and even
						reckless altruism. His life in this regard was fully equal to his teachings. There was a
						total lack of tact in his public conduct. He was the exact opposite of his greatest
						apostle--Paul--who not only lived by the exercise of discretion to a fairly good old
						age, but by asserting his rights as a Roman citizen, died a painless death. Why should
						Christ have allowed himself to be brutally murdered at the early age of thirty-three and
						after only three years of public work, when, by the exercise of ordinary prudence, he
						could easily have had forty or even fifty years more of usefulness? Was he beside
						himself? Did he believe, as he plainly said, that the world was about to end? His life
						may not improperly be called a romance of altruism. Nothing before or since in this
						regard has ever equaled it. Of course, we are more or less familiar with the theological
						explanation of this question of his self-sacrifice, viz.: that he was "the Lamb slain
						from the foundation of the world."</p>
					<p>Christ seems to have unnecessarily arrayed himself against the authority of his nation.
						His language <pb id="VAB8208-035" n="35"/> towards those in power could not have
						otherwise than embittered them against him. The terms, "Generation of vipers";
						"Hypocrites"; "Thieves," seem to have been unnecessarily severe. It is impossible for
						worldly wisdom to speak of his political conduct as otherwise than recklessly imprudent.
						Now, this recklessness of consequences in condemning public or private wrong--this
						unparalleled disregard of the euphemisms and conventionalities of this world--was part
						and parcel of that model altruistic life divinely ordered for our imitation. The world
						has seen since his time but few men who have dared to say as he said to tact and
						prudence, "Get behind me." Occasionally, men have arisen--like Savonarola, Martin
						Luther, John Huss and John Knox--who have braved death and contumely for the sake of
						their convictions. While the overwhelming majority of us all will and do crook the knee
						to power and fawn upon success, and turn to our politeness and conventionality rather
						than to our duty in dealing with the wrong, still to the credit of humanity be it said
						that there is always among every people a small minority who are willing to follow the
						Master's example and die unhonored deaths and moulder in forgotten graves unwept and
						unsung, for the sake of the right.</p>
					<p>Our Saviour was certainly the greatest personality of which history has given us any
						record. Personality is easily the greatest thing in the whole world. What is it? It is
						not intellect, nor emotion, nor will. It is that which lies back of and uses all of them
						in turn as it suits itself and as its instruments. It is greater than love, for love is
						only an incident of personality. Personality <pb id="VAB8208-036" n="36"/> is that which
						makes me me, and you you, and which gives to either me or you power or weakness. We
						perfectly understand the difference between a strong and weak personality. Personality
						is what makes one man a leader and another one a follower. Personality easily made
						Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Napoleon, each equal to ten thousand soldiers.
						Sometimes we call physical personality, for lack of a better term, Presence. Often, as
						in the case of Blaine and Aaron Burr, we call it personal magnetism. A man's personality
						is always greater than anything he says or does. Daniel Webster was greater than any of
						his speeches; Caesar greater than any of his deeds. There are few that can resist the
						magnetic power of eye to eye and hand in hand, both of which are instruments of the
						personality which controls them. The apostles are full of reminiscences of the
						Personality of the Master. One speaks of himself as an "eye-witness to his Majesty."
						Another of Him as the "Word of life, whom we have seen with our eyes and handled with
						our hands," and still another of Him as "whom not having seen, we love."</p>
					<p>It was the enthusiasm of his remembered personality which made the martyrs of the first
						century laugh at torture and welcome death. "In his Name" in all ages has robbed
						presecution of its terrors and turned beds of torment into beds of roses. His
						personality has from the beginning now for nineteen centuries been the inspiration of
						his Church. This personality is wonderfully illustrated in that battle-hymn of the
						twelfth chapter of Hebrews, beginning with those trumpet-like <pb id="VAB8208-037"
							n="37"/> words, "Wherefore seeing that we are compassed about with so great a crowd of
						witnesses."</p>
					<p>What is the Church? It is a mighty organization with nearly nineteen hundred years of
						historic unity, the purpose of which is to hand down from age to age and from generation
						to generation the Personality of the Master. And upon the whole, in spite of innumerable
						blunderings, and shortcomings, and errors, it has done it. "In that century-long march,
						the van has often forgot the rear, the individual has been lost and man forgotten, still
						humanity has marched on, and 'In His Name,' the will of God, notwithstanding the vast
						mass of human crime and resistance, is slowly getting itself done on earth as in
						heaven."</p>
					<p>The object of the Church being to perpetuate the Personality of the Master, which it
						wisely recognizes as more than either miracle or doctrine, it has called to its aid all
						the arts, fine and unfine, known to the world. What constitutes the inspiration of the
						thousand cathedrals erected "In His Name" all over the civilized world? A cathedral is
						not, as Madame de Stael once put it, "frozen music," but the religious sentiment
						blossoming into stone. Its purpose is to bring the soul of the worshipper nearer and
						still nearer to Him. Here as nowhere else the Personality of the Master "trances the
						heart through chanting choirs and through the priest the mind inspires." And how glad
						has canvas been to yield its colors, and marble its white splendors, to draw us nearer,
						through the magic of color and form, to the Personality of the Master! Art is heaven on
						earth. And as "God's is in heaven all's well with the <pb id="VAB8208-038" n="38"/>
						world." Has the power of art spent itself in its presentation of the Master in the
						bygone centuries? So far from it, that within the last dozen years Van Marx has given us
						a better Virgin and Child than Raphael, and Van Hoffman has painted a picture of the boy
						Christ before the elders, which, had it been done by Michael Angelo, would have set the
						world aflame.</p>
					<p>What inspires Music so that it joyfully yields up its wordless treasures, and Poetry
						its wealth of words and rythmns, like the Personality of Jesus Christ? From Handel, and
						Hayden, and other great Masters in the upper realms of music, down to Bliss and Sankey,
						who sing for the common people, each and all alike were inspired by this same
						Personality. What treasures does the hymn book open to our waiting souls! Talk about
						Tennyson, Browning, Wordsworth, and Whittier, as the masters of song: I will any time,
						from any dog-eared hymn book, quote you poetry which, for breadth of thought and
						inspiration of soul, they have never approached. I will easily find you hymns that are
						mounts of transfiguration, from whose heights we see the Master's face shining whiter
						than any fuller's earth. Hymns touch us at the profoundest depths of our being, simply
						because they are perfumed with the Personality of Christ. The hymn easily vanquishes the
						limitations of time and space and reveals to us the shining city beyond, whose walls are
						jasper and whose gates are pearl. Hymns are those airy yet none the less substantial
						bridges spanning the chasm between the here and hereafter, over whose arches and
						abutments we easily and safely pass from the kingdoms of the seen <pb id="VAB8208-039"
							n="39"/> and the temporal to that house beyond, not made with hands, eternal in the
						heavens, in the realms of the invisible. The hymn book is a supplemental Bible. As well
						expect a bird to fly without wings as to retain the fidelity and the spirituality and
						arouse the enthusiasm of the Church without its hymns.</p>
					<p>And what is the Holy Spirit except Personality of the Master, teaching and dominating
						in a greater or less degree our individual personalities? What is the Paraclite except
						the shadow of His Personality resting upon the individual and the Church? What is
						conversion except Christ's Personality resting upon us even as an earthly friend comes
						to us with hand upon hand and eye upon eye and to whom we yield the tribute of our
						tears? What is Regeneration but the substitution, more or less perfect, invariably less
						than more, of his Personality for our personality? What are the dearest and sweetest
						experiences of our religious life except occasions when the invisible Christ walks with
						us? The perpetuation of the Personality of the Master is the true office of the Church,
						and only those who the most effectively enter into His spirit are the most worthy of his
						ministers. The office of the minister is to make vivid, and to perpetuate by all
						possible means, the spirit and teachings of the Master. The Church is never, any more
						than a government, in advance of the members which compose it. More than often a Church
						is only a Sunday club-house, representing the prosperity of the community. More than
						often its members are wealth and luxury-loving fashion plates, and the Sabbath is simply
						a social dress parade. Unfortunately, such <pb id="VAB8208-040" n="40"/> Churches never
						have the slightest difficulty in securing preachers who respond to their demands. "Like
						people, like priest."</p>
					<p>But while the majority of our Churches are honeycombed and handicapped with
						worldliness, still every community has its seven, or seventy, or seven hundred, who have
						never bowed the knee to Baal. These are the minority--mostly women--who attend its
						prayer meetings, who constitute the Church within the Church, and who keep the torch
						burning and pass it on from generation to generation. And its ministers are not all
						time-servers by any means. Every community has its notable and worthy Christian heralds,
						men who--like Phillip Brooks, or Moody, or David Swing, or Talmage, in this generation,
						or the Wesleys and Whitefields at the close of the last century--have been touched and
						inspired by the Personality of the Master, and who have been faithful armor-bearers,
						each in his different way--for David Swing was to Dwight L. Moody little better than an
						infidel--and have kept alive in the world the Master's Personality.</p>
					<p>Your true Christian minister is neither the graceful essayist nor the thrilling orator;
						nor is the most effective sermon a polished disquisition upon evolution or sociology,
						nor a sweetened-water exhortation to be good and thereby be happy. It is rather the
						"Sword of the Spirit"--full of the Master's Personality and of the great fact that this
						world is a place for service; that life is a discipline, a trust and a preparation, and
						that there is rest beyond. The Church is a place for the higher life; its chief end is
						neither oyster nor <pb id="VAB8208-041" n="41"/> strawberry sociables, but to learn of
						the Master,--leaving the social and political questions of the day to the lyceum and the
						hustings, and rendering to God, on God's day, the things that belong to God.</p>
					<p>What is the true method of the Master's service? It certainly seems to me to be the
						Evangelical. By that is meant the method which assumes the validity of the great truths
						of the Bible and never argues them, but aims to arouse the enthusiasm, the zeal and the
						worship of their congregations. For we must never forget what religion is and what it is
						not. It is not ethics, nor wisdom, nor argument. All these are invaluable. It is not
						these any more than botany is roses or anatomy is life. Botany and anatomy are well, but
						flowers and children are better. Religion is the life of God in the soul. Religion is as
						much different from and is as much above orthodoxy and creeds as Arrarat is above the
						plains that surround it. Creeds at their best are only those hindering cobwebs with
						which human arrogance and impertinence have attempted to limit and define what is
						illimitable and undefinable.</p>
					<p>We must never forget that our Saviour at no time professed to be and is not now an
						intellectual any more than a political king. While supreme and superb in the domain of
						ethics, yet he is vastly more than a moral teacher. He is the fountain and the main
						source of our spiritualities. "Spiritual things are spiritually discerned." He who
						fancies that Christ will reveal himself to investigation as the "one altogether lovely
						and the chiefest among ten thousand," will go away from the quest disappointed.
						Love--Purity--Humility--are <pb id="VAB8208-042" n="42"/> the three interposing and
						interpreting mediums; and if these are wanting, the Man on Calvary may be a beautiful
						ideal but never a reality.</p>
					<p>One of the current solutions of the Christ problem is that he was a poet and believed
						that the world was soon to end. If so, then of what use was property, or social rank, or
						those prizes of life for which we so zealously strive? He certainly did say: "But some
						of this generation shall not see death," and his Disciples certainly did believe that
						the end of all things was at hand. Clearly this is the key to the visions vouchsafed
						John on Patmos. But in this He and they were evidently misunderstood, or He said
						something further which has not been reported, or the key has been lost.</p>

					<head rend="center">IN CONCLUSION</head>

					<p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> no time or place has our Saviour ever held himself out as other
						than an object of worship. "All power is given me in heaven and earth," is one of his
						magnificent and sublime utterances. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." Our
						Saviour professes to have spoken God's Word and to be God's will expressed in terms of
						human conduct. In other words, he professes to be infinitely more than a teacher--an
						Incarnation. He says that his thoughts are God's thoughts expressed in human accents.
						This is a most astounding claim; but do not his miracles, his teachings and himself
						prove it? If either of these three great links in the chain--Miracles, Message, and
						Master--are wanting, we must conclude that he was simply <pb id="VAB8208-043" n="43"/> a
						man. How vain is the endeavor to take away miracles and still preserve Christianity! And
						yet there is a growing disposition, even within the Church, in these last days of the
						domination of science, to regard miracles as the fairy tales of early Christianity.
						Impair the last and the greatest of his miracles--the Resurrection--and that ends
						Christianity. From and after the disbelief in our Saviour's Resurrection, Christianity
						only becomes an exquisite and ideal system of ethics. No man ever had a clearer
						perception of this great truth than St. Paul. Within twenty-five years after our
						Saviour's crucifixion he said: "If Christ be not risen from the dead, then is our
						preaching vain and ye are yet in your sins."</p>
					<p>Worship is the highest act of the soul. The intellect has no knees. The only avenue to
						God is worship; and this avenue is the same for both ignorance and wisdom. To that end
						our Saviour led his life of perfect deeds; to that end the New Testament has come down
						to us; to that end our Saviour's life has been made supremely beautiful. "In His Name,"
						we marry our daughters, baptize our children, and bury our dead. "In His Name," we
						cheerfully clasp his hand and fearlessly go down into "the dark shadow of the valley of
						death." How could we do all this if Christ were a mere man? If he were not divine?</p>
