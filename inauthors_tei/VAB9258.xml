				<p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the annual meeting of the F<hi rend="sc">ORTY-SIXTH</hi> I<hi
						rend="sc">NDIANA</hi> R<hi rend="sc">EGIMENTAL</hi> A<hi rend="sc">SSOCIATION</hi>, held
					at Delphi, Ind., in September last, it was determined that a History of the Regiment
					should be prepared, and a committee was appointed to compile the work. The duty has been
					performed, and the Committee presents this volume as the result of its labor, in the hope
					that the book will serve the purpose of the Association, in giving the survivors of the
					Regiment, in sufficient detail, a record of most of the incidents of the service.</p>
				<p>The Committee does not pretend that it has succeeded in compiling a work that will
					entertain the general public, though, to many outside of the organization, it may prove
					interesting. It was designed to furnish the survivors of the Regiment, their families and
					friends, a book which, now and in future years, may recall the stirring and exciting
					scenes through which the Regiment passed.</p>
				<p>Much difficulty has been encountered by the Committee, in reaching facts and dates
					through the memory of the members of the Regiment. The lapse of a quarter of a century has
					dimmed the memory of nearly all, and left many interesting facts and events forgotten.
					With the material at hand, the Committee has done the best that was possible, and believes
					that the History will be found as complete as could be expected.</p>
				<p>The service of the Regiment was varied. It served on land and water. Much of its time was
					spent on gunboats, transports and flatboats. It served in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri,
					Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. It was <pb id="VAB9258-006" n="vi"/> often
					engaged independent of other regiments. It was in active service nearly four years, and
					with many of its original members as officers. It was in many important actions, and
					acknowledges one <hi rend="i">bona-fide</hi> retreat. The members of the Regiment were
					harmonious, and the most unwelcome order was always promptly obeyed.</p>

				<p>The members of the Committee acknowledge the pleasure they have enjoyed in reviving many
					forgotten incidents of the service, and the companionship of the comrades of those
					eventful days. Even the fatigue, the danger and the suffering of the times, were
					compensated for, by the acts of kindness they called out, and cannot be forgotten.</p>
				<p>The record of no Indiana regiment was dimmed by any act that dishonored its members or
					the State. The Forty-sixth simply claims that it was an Indiana regiment, and that its
					members are satisfied with its record.</p>

					<p><hi rend="b">T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi></hi> campaigns of the "three months' service" were
						concluded. The defeat at Bull Run had been suffered, and the Nation was preparing for
						the desperate struggle, now manifestly upon it. Indiana was alive with military
						preparation. Already she had many regiments in the field. Cass, Carroll and White
						counties had recruited and sent the Nation's army six companies of infantry, and a
						considerable number of the citizens of those counties had joined organizations in other
						districts. Portions of a regiment had been recruited at Logansport, under a promise by
						Governor Morton that a regiment would be accepted from that point, provided the State
						should be at no expense for quarters. Barracks had been commenced there, on a citizens'
						subscription, and were sufficiently advanced to be made habitable by the 7th of October,
						1861. Final authority for organizing the Forty-sixth Regiment was received in the
						following: <q rend="blockquote"><hi rend="right">I<hi rend="sc">NDIANAPOLIS</hi>,
								September 30, 1861.</hi> "Hon. R. P. DeHart, Hon. Graham N. Fitch, Newton G. Scott
							and Thomas H. Bringhurst are authorized to raise a regiment, to rendezvous at
							Logansport. Build your barracks, hurry up your company organizations and put them in
							camp. <hi rend="right">"By order of G<hi rend="sc">OVERNOR</hi> O. P. M<hi rend="sc"
									>ORTON</hi>.<lb/> "W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> R. H<hi rend="sc"
								>OLLOWAY</hi>."</hi>
						</q>
					</p>

					<p>This stimulated recruiting, and, in a few days, the regiment was in camp, made up as
						follows:</p>
					<list type="simple">

					</list>
					<p>The camp was fully organized and under discipline by October 7, when John H. Gould was
						appointed to command the barracks, who issued the first "regimental orders" on that
						day.</p>
					<p>On September 30, 1861, commissions were issued by Governor Morton to the field
						officers, as follows: Graham N. Fitch, colonel; Newton G. Scott, lieutenant colonel;
						Thomas H. Bringhurst, major; Richard P. DeHart, adjutant; and, on September 24, to David
						D. Dykeman, quartermaster; on December 11, to Robert Irvin, chaplain; on October 7, to
						Horace Coleman, surgeon, and to William S. Haymond, assistant surgeon.</p>
					<p>During October, 1861, the several companies having been filled up to the maximum,
						elections were held for company officers, resulting in the following organizations:</p>

					<list>
						<item>Company A.--Captain, John H. Gould; first lieutenant, William A. Pigman; second

						<item>Company B.--Captain, Aaron M. Flory; first lieutenant, John T. Castle; second

						<item>Company K.--Captain, Benjamin F. Grover; first lieutenant, Robert M. Shields;
							second lieutenant, Jacob H. Leiter.</item>
					</list>

					<p>Commissions for the above officers were given them at Indianapolis, on December 11,
						bearing date October 4, 1861.</p>
					<p>Anticipating an early departure, the several departments of the regiment were actively
						engaged in procuring the necessary supplies. An abundance of comfortable clothing was
						received and distributed. An inferior article of Enfield rifles was received. Horses
						were purchased for wagons. [The wagons were met at Louisville.] Pending the expected
						orders to move, the regiment was industriously drilled. On the 28th of November the
						monotony of camp life was diversified by the marriage of Mr. William Cornell, of Company
						D., to Miss Annett Smith, by the regimental chaplain, Robert Irvin. The ceremony was
						performed on a platform, in the presence of the assembled regiment.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 12th of December, 1861, the Forty-sixth regiment broke camp and
						prepared for actual service. At 8 o'clock the line was formed and the regiment was
						mustered into the service of the United States by Lieutenant Edgar E. Phelps, of the
						regular army, for three years. Officers and men took the regulation oath, and, led by
						the Logan band, took up the line of march for the war. The route was direct for the
						depot of the Wabash railroad, where the regiment was rapidly and safely placed on
						comfortable cars, and, at 10 o'clock, the train moved slowly off toward LaFayette. Just
						previous to the departure a handsome national flag was presented to the regiment by the
						citizens of Logansport, through Mr. Charles B. Lasselle, which was received, on behalf
						of the regiment, by Colonel G. N. Fitch.</p>
					<p>As descriptive of the departure of the regiment, the following is copied from the
						Logansport <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of December 14, 1861: <pb id="VAB9258-012" n="12"/>
						<q rend="blockquote"><p>"The spectacle was such as has never before been witnessed in
								this place. The streets through which the regiment marched were crowded with people,
								and it was scarcely possible to make a passage through the mass. The gleam of the
								bright Enfields, the measured tread of the thousand men, the music, the gallant
								bearing of the soldiers, and, more than all, the thought that all this
								preparation--this bustle--was, most likely, the opening scene to a bloody tragedy,
								gave an interest to the occasion that could be experienced at no other time.</p>
							<milestone unit="typography" n="*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *"
								rend="center"/>
							<p>"At the depot the scene was still more exciting. No less than four thousand persons
								had gathered there to take a last look at the boys and bid them good-bye. Mothers
								who had given up their only son, to subject him to certain hardship, danger and
								probable death to vindicate the honor of the Government; fathers bravely struggling
								against fraternal emotion and exhorting their boys to noble deeds in the defense of
								the right; brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, all shaken by a natural grief at the
								sad parting, yet, with all, not a word of repining, not a wish that the loved ones
								should remain at home in the hour of their country's peril."</p></q></p>
					<p>Arriving at LaFayette, the regiment was received at the depot by the Fortieth Regiment,
						under Colonel Wilson, and by Cox's battery.</p>
					<p>On the arrival of the regiment at Indianapolis, camp was found already prepared by a
						detail sent down in advance, and orders were in waiting directing the regiment to
						proceed immediately to Louisville. The train was taken for Madison on the 14th of
						December.</p>
					<p>Madison was reached at 3 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi> on the 15th. The reception was rather
						cold and cheerless. The boats intended for the regiment were not ready, and the men were
						compelled to accept quarters along the levee until daylight. At 6.30 <hi rend="sc">A.
							M.</hi> the right division, under the lieutenant colonel, marched aboard the "City of
						Madison," and the left, under the major, the "Lancaster, No. 3." At 10 o'clock the boats
						pushed out into the river. The levee was lined with people, who greeted the soldiers
						with cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs. The soldiers responded with such shouts as
						a thousand such throats could utter.</p>
					<p>As the two boats passed down the river, with the crowded levee in sight and under the
						sound of the bells ringing for church, it recalled to many a similar scene, which
						occurred on the same spot, years before. In 1846 a company from Cass county was going to
						the Mexican war. It came from Logansport, through Indianapolis, to Madison, and was
						transported by steamboat from Madison to Louisville on a Sunday morning. The same
						drummer <pb id="VAB9258-013" n="13"/> who beat to the tune of "The Girl I Left Behind
						Me" then, again beat to the same tune now from a similar position.</p>
					<p>The passage down the river was uneventful. In landing, one of the men walked off a
						plank, and would have been drowned only for the prompt assistance of his comrades. This
						soldier had been in the enjoyment of a pair of new shoes, and his apparent anxiety to
						keep them out of the water submerged his head. Quite an effort was necessary, on the
						part of the man's friends, to restore his vital parts to the atmosphere, at the expense
						of the shoes.</p>
					<p>The regiment arrived at Jeffersonville at 1 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> At 4, orders came
						for disembarkation at Louisville. At 7 o'clock the regiment was on its camp ground, on
						or near the Oakland race course, a short distance from the city. Orders were out for an
						immediate march, but some delay was necessary, on account of the non-arrival of the
						wagons. A large number of troops were on the ground, and there was much confusion.</p>
					<p>The regimental wagons arrived on the 18th. The horses were hitched up in their new
						harness and made a grand appearance.</p>
					<p>The chaplain, Mr. Irvin, organized the postoffice.</p>
					<p>Swain H. Nelson, of Company A, was injured by the accidental discharge of a gun. He was
						subsequently killed at Champion's Hill.</p>
					<p>The regiment was restricted to thirteen wagons. This necessitated the turning over of
						forty horses. Mr. Van Vorst, the wagon-master, was so discriminating in his selection
						that the best animals largely predominated on the regiment's side.</p>
					<p>The regiment left Camp Oakland on the 18th of December at 2 o'clock, and encamped for
						the night at Fern creek, eleven miles from Louisville.</p>
					<p>The Eleventh Michigan, which left in advance, was already in camp. The wagons were
						behind, and did not arrive in time for cooking. Considerable grumbling arose from the
						necessity of going to bed without supper. The wagons straggled in during the night, and
						as each one arrived, the driver aroused the camp in finding his company.</p>
					<p>Reveille was beaten on the 19th at 4 o'clock, and some hours were spent in hunting up
						camp property and getting into shape. Then there was a march of seven miles to a camp by
						a spring, and on hilly ground.</p>
					<p>On the 20th, fifteen miles were made with much complaint about stiff limbs and sore
						feet. During the night, the Fifty-eighth <pb id="VAB9258-014" n="14"/> Ohio, Colonel
						Carr, arrived and went into camp. Many of the men were broken down. Their wagons and
						some hired teams were loaded with exhausted men, knapsacks and guns. The men were so
						tired that, without waiting for tents, they threw themselves upon the ground and slept.
						During the night the thermometer fell to twelve degrees.</p>

					<p>On the 21st the regiment reached Bardstown, forty miles from Louisville. The encampment
						was on the south fork of Green river. Here a member of Company I had an attack of
						insanity. He broke from camp and went through houses generally, greatly alarming the
						natives. He was finally subdued. The weather turned cold and there was much suffering.
						Some had small stoves, which helped considerably. On the 23d a move was made to a better
						location. Great preparations were being made for Christmas. Negroes came in with turkies
						and pies, all of which found a ready market. On the 28th camp was again moved, five
						miles south on the pike.</p>
					<p>On the 2d a large Sibley tent, occupied by a number of Company H, took fire while the
						regiment was on drill. The edifice, with its entire contents, was destroyed, and twenty
						homeless wanderers were cast upon the charities of an unsympathizing camp. No insurance.
						On the same day the quartermaster sent a trusty agent to town for rations of groceries.
						Meeting with unexpected good friends, the man became confused in his mission, and drew
						1,200 pounds of fresh meat. He arrived in camp at midnight, and insisted that meat was
						what the quartermaster wanted.</p>
					<p>The regiment was drilled four hours in the morning and three in the afternoon. The
						latter drill was with knapsacks. None were exempt from the duty, except on surgeon's
						certificate. The earlier and later portions of the day were devoted to persimmons, of
						which there was an abundance.</p>
					<p>On the 6th the regiment started for Camp Wickliff, twenty-three miles distant, and went
						into camp at Knob creek, fourteen miles. Weather severely cold and roads muddy. Reached
						Wickliff at 11 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi> There was great confusion from the rush of
						troops and stores. Thermometer fifteen degrees.</p>
					<p>The Forty-sixth at Wickliff, was brigaded with the Forty-first Ohio, the Forty-seventh
						Indiana and the Sixth Kentucky, under command of Colonel William B. Hazen, of the
						Forty-first Ohio. Squad, company, regimental and brigade schools were immediately
						organized, and, in fair weather, drilling occupied the greater part <pb id="VAB9258-015"
							n="15"/> of the day. The regimental drills were enjoyed from 1 to 4 o'clock each
						afternoon, a portion of the time with knapsacks. The sick list averaged 125.</p>

					<p>During the five weeks' stay at Camp Wickliff there was much wet and cold weather. The
						discipline of General Nelson was very severe, rendering the first experience of the
						regiment in military life not enchanting.</p>
					<p>The regiment started for the Ohio river on the 14th of February. The weather was very
						cold, and the roads exceedingly heavy. Sixteen miles were made by evening. The men
						suffered very much, and the fatigue was much aggravated by the imperative orders of
						General Nelson against straggling. Went into camp at dark. The wagons had stalled, and
						did not come in until 9 o'clock. The weather grew colder and there were no tents. An
						abundance of hay was found and appropriated. Fences were also used quite liberally.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained in that camp all the next day, and on the 16th again took up the
						line of march, and arrived within two miles of the Ohio river at dark. On this last
						march the suffering was extreme. Over a thousand men straggled. Many did not get into
						camp until the next day. The Forty-sixth suffered as little as any regiment, and came
						into camp in fair order. It was on this march that General Nelson gathered in so many
						swords from officers, for permitting their men to lie on the snow.</p>
					<p>On the 17th orders were received to prepare for embarkation on steamboats. They were
						already at the landing, awaiting their loads. The assignment of boats for the division
						was as follows:</p>
					<p>On the "Diana," the Sixth Ohio, with General Nelson, as the flag ship; on the
						"Autocrat," the Twenty-fourth Ohio; on the "John Raines," the Fifty-first Ohio; on the
						"Woodford," the Thirty-sixth Indiana; on the "Silver Moon," the right wing of the
						Forty-first Ohio; on the "Lady Jackson," the left wing of the Forty-first Ohio; on the
						"Glendale," the right wing of the Forty--seventh Indiana; on the "Lady Pike," the left
						wing of the Forty-seventh Indiana; on the "Izetta," Companies A, F, D and I, of the
						Forty-sixth Indiana; on the "City of Madison," Companies C, H and E, and on the "Golden
						State," G, K and B, of the same regiment; on the "Lancaster, No. 4," the right wing, and
						on the "Switzerland," the left wing of the Sixth Kentucky.</p>

					<p>A field officer was on each boat. Colonel Fitch was on the "City of Madison,"
						Lieutenant Colonel Scott on the "Izetta" and <pb id="VAB9258-016" n="16"/> Major
						Bringhurst on the "Golden State." The work of loading was accomplished by 8 <hi
							rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, with great difficulty. The loaded wagons were backed down the
						steep bank by large details of men, and the miscellaneous equipage of the regiment was
						piled up on the boats' decks in great confusion. It was not assorted until late next
						day. The officers were ordered to run the boats in a prescribed order, in double column,
						with the "Diana" in the lead. The imperative order to each was to follow his leader,
						regardless of circumstances. The fleet started out in a misty rain, and the boats became
						considerably mixed up. Stops were necessary on account of the fog, and at daylight the
						fleet had made only eighty miles. Cannelton was reached by 9 o'clock, where a full
						supply of coal had been ordered and was expected. None was ready, and General Nelson
						loudly threatened to hang the proprietor for his delinquency. The fleet remained until
						5.30 <hi rend="sc">P. M</hi>., getting what coal was possible.</p>
					<p>After considerable running up and down the river, a portion of the fleet reached
						Smithland, at the mouth of the Cumberland river, and 315 miles below the starting point.
						Here the leading boats turned up the river, and the "Golden State," with the left
						companies, followed to Evansville, 151 miles above. The other boats, with the remainder
						of the regiment, had not been seen since the start, on the 17th.</p>
					<p>The portion of the fleet now together (seventeen boats), kept on past Evansville, and
						it seemed that the whole expedition had lost purpose and was returning at will. The
						order to follow the leading boat was still good, but the major in charge of the "Golden
						State," thinking it a waste of fuel to be thus aimlessly running up and down the river,
						when about twelve miles above Evansville, ordered the captain of the boat to run in
						shore and tie up until General Nelson found out what he wanted to do. Accordingly the
						"Golden State" was turned into the bank and tied up, while the soldiers, crew and
						officers of the boat patiently awaited developments. Boat after boat passed up until all
						seemed gone.</p>
					<p>Suddenly the "Diana," the flag ship, was seen coming down the river, under a full head
						of steam. Evidently the "Golden State" was noticed, for the "Diana" turned short in
						toward her. And now there was tribulation among the occupants of the "Golden State." The
						plainest order of General Nelson had been disobeyed, and the reputation of that officer
						for severe discipline warranted any punishment that could be anticipated.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-017" n="17"/>

					<p>As the "Diana" came near, an aide of the general's came to the side of the boiler deck
						and inquired the name of the regiment and of the colonel, which were given him by the
						major. In a moment the general himself came forward and inquired the reason of the
						boat's position. The major described an accident that had occurred near Evansville--not
						serious. The general said he would come aboard and see what was the matter, and the
						captain of the boat hastened to the engineer, to post him on the situation. On coming on
						board, the general sent for that officer and got an accurate description of the break,
						and an estimate of the time required to repair it. Many inquiries were made by the
						general about the regiment and Colonel Fitch. He said the regiment was a good one and
						had good officers, but all had much to learn. He was invited to dinner by the major and
						concluded to stay.</p>
					<p>At dinner the general was very sociable, but there was a cloud over the boat officers.
						The captain had a card suspended over the table announcing that one dollar and fifty
						cents per day would be charged officers for board. The general ordered the card down,
						and threatened that if he ever knew him to charge over one dollar per day, he would hunt
						him up and execute him. He said the Government paid a large sum for the service of the
						boats, and the soldiers should not be imposed upon.</p>
					<p>After dinner, the general invited the major to go with him on board the "Diana," which
						he did, after leaving orders with the captain of the "Golden State" to come to
						Evansville, as soon as the repairs were completed. On the "Diana" the officers of the
						boat and of the Sixth Ohio were about to sit down to dinner. On invitation, the general
						and the major again dined.</p>
					<p>At Evansville, the general and his new aide went to the telegraph office, whence the
						general sent many dispatches up the river. They then returned to the landing, and, as
						the "Golden State" had arrived, the major went on board and started down the river.
						Before leaving, the general gave especial orders that the regiment should wait at
						Paducah for orders from him, for he should retain it in his division.</p>
					<p>The "Golden State" reached Paducah at 3.30 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi>, on the 21st. The
						major immediately reported the regiment to General Sherman, who was in his office with
						his aides, busy forwarding troops on their several routes. He directed the Forty-sixth
						to report to General Payne, at Cairo, and at 6 o'clock the "Golden State," with her
						three companies, was again steaming down the river.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-018" n="18"/>
					<p>The "City of Madison" and the "Izetta," with the remainder of the regiment, reached
						Paducah on the evening of the 21st, and were sent on to Cairo. General Nelson made
						strenuous efforts with General Sherman to retain the regiment, but without success. The
						several companies did not come together until they met at Commerce, on the 23d of
						February.</p>
					<p>On the arrival of the "Golden State" at Cairo, the whole regiment was ordered by
						General Payne to report to General Pope, at Commerce, Missouri.</p>

					</list>
					<p>At Cairo were the 15,000 prisoners captured at Fort Donaldson; and the gunboats that
						had taken so prominent a part in that magnificent victory. On the 21st orders were
						received to draw rations and proceed to Commerce, forty miles above Cairo. The other two
						boats had not yet arrived, but the "Golden State" steamed out on the 23d, at noon, and
						reached Commerce, after much delay from sandbars, at 6 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi></p>
					<p>On the 23d the companies on the "Golden State" began unloading, and were soon in camp
						on the bluffs. The "Izetta," under Lieutenant Colonel Scott, with four of the tardy
						companies, came in and spent the remainder of the day in unloading. On the 24th of
						February the regiment was on the road to Benton, Mo. Immense quantities of stores and
						ammunition were on the road, and artillery and cavalry were hurrying to the front.
						Benton was reached at 2 o'clock. The town is the county seat, and has all the adjuncts
						of an imposing court. There was a large bar, according to the Record, but the members of
						it were absent, following the fortunes of General "Jeff" Thompson. The Forty-sixth
						filled the bench, the bar, the witness and the jury boxes, and members of it cried, "O
						yes! O yes!" from the sheriff's desk.</p>
					<p>The seats were fully occupied by the less ambitious members of the regiment. There was
						a great influx of law books in regimental quarters. General Palmer collected about a
						hundred volumes of reports and statutes and returned them to the Court-house. It was
						remarked that stray law books were found only about the quarters of ex-attorneys.
						Nothing was discovered in other tents except chickens and an occasional pig.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-021" n="21"/>

					<p>The remaining three companies of the regiment, under Colonel Fitch, arrived at Benton
						on the 25th. They had left the "City of Madison" at Cairo and shipped on the
						"Switzerland."</p>
					<p>On the 1st of March the regiment left Benton and soon found the road obstructed by
						timber and broken bridges. It went into camp at 5 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> Resumed the
						march next day. Heavy rain. Much mud. Crowded roads. Made five miles in five hours. At 3
							<hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> stacked knapsacks and marched seven miles to dryer ground. On
						the 3d, reached within thirteen miles of New Madrid, with a bright prospect for a fight.
						Overtook "Jeff" Thompson, two miles from camp, and captured three of his guns.</p>
					<p>There were now in Pope's column about 9,000 men, with some artillery. The Forty-sixth
						was in the Third Division, under General Palmer. The First Brigade (the Thirty-fourth
						and the Forty-seventh regiments) was under Colonel Slack. The Second Brigade (the
						Forty-third and the Forty-sixth) under Colonel Fitch. The Seventh Illinois Cavalry and
						the First Missouri Battery were attached to this division.</p>
					<p>At 1.30 the column was within two miles of New Madrid. City very quiet. A regiment of
						infantry and battalion of cavalry deployed on each side of the road. General Pope came
						up and took position. Skirmishers advanced. As the column came in view of the rebels,
						their gunboats opened fire. Their aim was good but their fuse short. The fire was kept
						up until 5 o'clock. In the meantime the Forty-sixth had been assigned, with an Iowa
						regiment, to support General Granger, who was pressing the rebels toward the river. On
						the retreat of the rebels the regiment went into camp.</p>
					<p>Up to the 13th, skirmishing and manœuvering occupied the time. A rebel surrender was
						now only a question of time.</p>
					<p>On the 14th, at 3 o'clock, the division marched out to relieve Stanley's First
						Division, in the trenches. Heavy guns had arrived and been placed in battery, ready for
						business. The rebels had become aware of the presence of their new antagonists, and had
						determined to leave. The Forty-sixth waded through deep mud and a heavy rain to their
						position, near the fort. At daylight, a squad of artillerists, under Captain Joseph A.
						Mower, suspecting an evacuation, went into the fort and found it empty. All were gone
						but three men. Two of them were asleep and the other drunk. Captain Mower took the
						colors of the Forty-seventh Regiment and raised them over the fort. As the raising fog
						enabled <pb id="VAB9258-022" n="22"/> the soldiers to see, a shout went up from those
						nearest, which was taken up and repeated to the outermost camp.</p>
					<p>The situation, as formed by the evacuation of the forts, left the rebels strongly
						fortified at Island No. 10, with six gunboats, under Commodore Hollins, hemmed in, in a
						twenty-mile stretch of river. They had an infantry force along the road between Island
						No. 10 and Tiptonsville, a distance, by land, of five or six miles. There were two
						Federal gunboats in the river, with the advantage, to them, of being able to go further
						down the stream.</p>
					<p>Tiptonsville was the gateway now to Island No. 10. When that was lost to the rebels the
						situation was lost. There was, already, a Federal gun at Point Pleasant, on the Missouri
						side, a few miles above Tiptonsville. Now, it was proposed to erect a battery further
						down, and opposite Tiptonsville.</p>
					<p>On the 16th of March the regiment started, at 9 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, down to the
						river bank. Extreme silence was enjoined. A few miles below New Madrid two large guns
						were met in the road with long ropes attached. Details of a hundred men were invited to
						"take hold," which was done, and, until five o'clock next morning, over hills, through
						swamps, the regiment dragged the guns, when Point Pleasant was reached, and in half an
						hour the tired and hungry men were asleep.</p>
					<p>At 2 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, on the 17th, the regiment started for Riddle's Point. To
						avoid the enemy it took a road back from the river. The road was swampy, and led through
						woods, cornfields, barn-yards, streams and fences. A halt was made back of the "Point"
						at 3.30, but too near the river, and a backward move was made. The whole division then
						went into camp on a fine large meadow. On the morning of the 18th four meals were due
						the men, and yet no wagons in sight. At 11 o'clock a dash was made for the straggling
						cattle, hogs and chickens, and the fast was broken at noon. At 4 o'clock all the wagons
						were up and a big supper was prepared. The long grass was cut and made into beds, and a
						huge sleep was anticipated. At 7 o'clock orders came to prepare for an immediate march,
						with arms and blankets. "Positively no talking or coughing" was an order often repeated.
						Marched two and one-half miles. The right was halted in pitch darkness. Companies A and
						C marched on, while the other companies stacked arms and were introduced to wagons
						loaded with spades, picks and empty corn sacks. With these the eight companies were
						armed and marched off in the darkness.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-023" n="23"/>
					<p>Although the regiment was in ignorance of what was to be done, there were those present
						who knew what was wanted and how to accomplish it. A few officers were dodging about
						with lines and pegs, and the men were soon at work, digging here and filling there,
						guided by the white pegs arranged by the engineers. Bags were filled and piled up, under
						their direction. At 12 o'clock it began to rain, with a sharp thunder storm. The
						remainder of the night was showery. The regiment was about opposite Tiptonsville, and
						the noise made by the rebels, as they loaded their transports, and their occasional
						shouts, could be distinctly heard.</p>
					<p>The work on the battery progressed rapidly all night. The men had but an imperfect
						understanding of their work, but they had confidence in the intelligence and skill that
						were directing them. Toward daylight a force was put to work digging rifle pits, for the
						protection of the men against the gunboats. Nearly enough were completed to afford
						protection for all; but all contained water.</p>
					<p>When daylight came the men were astonished at their work. There was a battery of four
						guns well protected by bags of earth, and by embankments. The magazine in the rear was a
						complete room, impervious to any attack. All seemed ready to receive and resist
						successfully, any assault from the boats. There were eighty rifle pits, looking
						comfortable enough, but rather unpleasantly similar to graves.</p>
					<p>After daylight, as the work was being finished, the men laid down, and many of them
						slept. Others were anticipating the surprise of the rebels when we opened fire on them.
						About 8 o'clock a fine large transport came puffing up the river. When opposite the
						battery, a gun was fired at her. The ball went screaming through the air, struck the
						water just inside the boat, and passed over her into the woods beyond. The boat put on
						all steam, and, after another ineffectual fire from the other gun, passed out of range.
						This scene had scarcely closed when another packet came up, evidently ignorant of the
						situation. At the landing at Tiptonsville, the boats set up a continuous whistling to
						warn coming boats of the danger, but the one coming up took no notice of it, and was
						soon in range. The guns were both ready, and fired separately. The first shot went just
						ahead of the boat. The second struck the water just behind the bow, arose and went
						crashing through the upper works. She kept on and was out of range before another shot
						could be had. In locating the battery, it had <pb id="VAB9258-024" n="24"/> been placed
						too far up the river. A heavy growth of cypress trees cut passing boats from view too
						soon. The men were in high glee over the performance, and wanted more. The gunners
						(regulars) said to them, "Wait a little." In a little while four rebel gunboats were
						seen putting out from Tiptonsville. They came over the river and paddled about for a
						while, and then opened fire. The first shell came from a boat directly opposite the
						rifle pits, passing over them and exploding just over the rear trench. The company which
						should have occupied it was at the bayou on guard. As each boat obtained position, it
						opened fire, and soon there was a perfect tempest of shot and shell. Their guns were
						well aimed, and the shells seemed to explode just where they wanted them. The round shot
						were thirty-twos. The rifles were sixes, tens and twelves. Some were all lead, others
						were iron, with a lead band for the rifles. After firing some time the boats changed
						position, and the men liked it less than before. One boat remained in front while the
						others came around toward the bayou to obtain a cross fire. A sloop came on an exact
						line with our trenches. She opened with three guns, throwing ten-inch fuse shells and
						six and ten-pound percussion. The fire from all the boats was continuous, and left no
						room outside the trenches for any living thing. The loose banks of the pits and trenches
						were plowed and dashed over the men in them, and the explosion of the shells in the air
						and over the trenches was terrific. The heavy shot caused a sound like a sudden storm,
						and the lighter ones a fierce scream.</p>

					<p>The firing continued nearly an hour and a quarter, and with very little intermission.
						Our guns got in only an occasional shot. When the gunners showed their heads a storm of
						iron came, compelling all to go down.</p>
					<p>During the firing it was reported that the rebels were landing, and the regiment was
						called out into line. The report proving false, the men went to the pits. Finding that
						the guns could not be dismounted, the fleet dropped down the river. But one man was
						killed in the attack, and he had no mark or wound about him. Dunfee, of Company H, was
						rendered deaf by the concussion of a shell.</p>
					<p>Companies C, D and I were at the bayou, on guard. They were nearer to the boats, and
						were often covered with the earth dashed out by the balls. Nearly every trench showed
						marks of the bombardment. Company A, on the right of the rear trench, <pb
							id="VAB9258-025" n="25"/> received a number, very close. F had them overhead. On the
						pits, marks were abundant. H occupied those on the right of the front, B on the left.
						The second of B from the left received a ball on its edge, which bounded out over the
						ground instead of into the pit, which it might have done. The first pit had two large
						balls over it, within two or three feet of the occupants. One of G's received a ball
						through the bank, which knocked it in, but did no other damage. Two balls struck the
						building back of H, which must have passed very close.</p>

					<p>After the engagement the regiment spent the remainder of the day in perfecting the
						works and in building new ones. Enough provisions were brought from camp for a partial
						meal at 2 o'clock. The regiment was relieved by the Forty-seventh, at 10 <hi rend="sc"
							>P. M.</hi></p>
					<p>The force at Riddle's Point consisted of the Thirty-fourth, Forty-third, Forty-sixth
						and Forty-seventh Indiana. There were also 200 cavalry, three light brass field pieces
						and two ten-pound Parrots, forming the division of General Palmer. At the battery below,
						the twenty-four pounders were worked by a detail of regulars.</p>
					<p>Operations at Tiptonsville were plainly visible from the Missouri side. The rebel
						gunboats were below, occasionally running up and exchanging shots. Heavy firing was
						constantly heard at Island No. 10. On the 22d of March four persons were killed by the
						explosion of a shell, thrown by a rebel gunboat, on the attack on the "Point." It had
						been kicked about since that time, and was considered harmless. A member of the
						Forty-seventh undertook to pick out the powder with a file. He, with a citizen and two
						boys, was killed by the explosion.</p>
					<p>The four Indiana regiments did the duty at the "Point." One went down each day. The
						rifle pits at the battery were extensively decorated. Some of the regiments cut seats in
						them, built chimneys and otherwise added to their usefulness as residences, but entirely
						destroyed them as a refuge from shot and shell. Others had to be built. The new pits
						were ornamented with wall paper, pictures, carpets, stoves, chairs, etc., borrowed from
						the adjacent abandoned dwellings.</p>
					<p>On the 1st of April a fearful storm of wind and rain swept over the camp, blowing down
						all the tents and flooding the ground.</p>
					<p>On the 4th of April the gunboat <hi rend="i">Carondelet</hi> ran the rebel batteries
							<pb id="VAB9258-026" n="26"/> above Island No. 10 and came on down to the city. On the
						7th the <hi rend="i">Pittsburg</hi> also ran past. The two then amused themselves with
						the rebel land batteries, silencing the most of them.</p>
					<p>On the 6th a transport, bearing the stars and stripes, passed rapidly down the river,
						turned and came up again. A rebel battery opened on it, when the <hi rend="i"
							>Carondelet</hi> opened on the battery and soon silenced it. Later the same gunboat
						attacked another battery and drove the gunners off. A squad was then sent ashore and the
						guns spiked. On the 7th the <hi rend="i">Carondelet</hi> again came down and silenced
						every battery that could be found. Our people on the Missouri side looked on, and were
						delighted with the entertainment.</p>
					<p>The 7th was the day of the Forty-sixth for duty at the "Point." It went out in a heavy
						rain. At 2 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, orders came for immediate embarkation. On the same
						afternoon the huge rebel floating battery came down the river. It was arrested and
						secured. The regiment embarked at 3.30, on the 9th. With the Forty-third, it went on the
						"Ohio Belle," and landed at Tiptonsville ville at 6 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, and went
						into camp for the night. The rebels were coming in and surrendering. Island No. 10 had
						fallen, and the retreat of the rebels was cut off. Three thousand prisoners, including
						Generals Mackall and Gant, were captured. The latter were on the steamer "Alec. Scott,"
						and were subjected to a very annoying scrutiny by the boys of the Forty-sixth. There
						were no introductions.</p>
					<p>This was the end of the campaign against Island No. 10, the first move toward the
						opening of the Mississippi. In it, as well as in the final acts at Vicksburg, the
						Forty-sixth regiment bore an important part.</p>
					<p>In a congratulatory order to General Pope, General Halleck said: <q rend="blockquote">
							"I congratulate you and your command on the success that has crowned your toils and
							exposure. You have given the final blow to the rebellion in Missouri, and proved
							yourselves worthy members of the brave army of the West."</q></p>
					<p>And General Pope said to his soldiers: <q rend="blockquote"> "Much as the general
							commanding has desired to shield the forces under his command from unnecessary
							suffering and loss of life, the success of our operations required unusual courage and
							patriotism, and an exhibition of the highest qualities of the soldier. The general
							commanding has expected much from the gallant men of this army, but he is proud and
								<pb id="VAB9258-027" n="27"/> gratified to-day that his anticipations have been more
							than realized, and that he has been impressed with a confidence in the officers and
							men of this command, which foreshadows for them a most brilliant future." * *</q></p>
					<p>Up to the 15th, the regiment was engaged in scouting over the country, capturing rebels
						and stores. On the 15th, at 7 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi>, the regiment went on board the
						"G. W. Graham" and the "Emma." General Palmer, with his staff, went on the "Graham."
						Colonel Fitch commanded the brigade. At 3 o'clock the boats were in sight of Osceola,
						Ark. The smoke of the rebel gunboats and of Fort Pillow was seen across the bend. On the
						16th, the fleet, then numbering twenty-two transports, crossed and tied up on the
						Arkansas side. In the evening the mortarboats began throwing shells into the fort. At
						the same time the "Jessie Benton," a beautiful little tug belonging to the navy, took
						fire and was destroyed. On the 17th, the paymaster came and interviewed the boys, making
						the first payment on that date. The entire transport fleet, except the "Graham" and
						"Emma," went up the river, leaving only the Forty-third and Forty-sixth with the
						gunboats.</p>
					<p>At Osceola the ground was wet and low and the river high. The brigade was on land
						during the day and on the boats at night. The weather was hot. The sick list, on the
						23d, was 104. Up to the 9th of May, nothing of interest occurred. Scouting parties went
						inland, in boats, and any employment that offered was accepted to occupy the time. Under
						a "Military Masonic Charter," a lodge of Masons was organized at a plantation house,
						near Osceola, under the direction of Surgeon Horace Coleman. Regular meetings were held,
						and the institution did quite a satisfactory business. The "jewels" were manufactured at
						the steamboat blacksmith shop. Beyond the usual benefactions of the institution, the
						meetings helped to break the monotony of the situation.</p>
					<p>On the 9th the rebel gunboats came up, and a regular engagement occurred between the
							<hi rend="i">Van Dorn, Price, Sumpter, Lovell, Little Rebel, Beauregard</hi> and the
							<hi rend="i">Bragg</hi>, and the Federal fleet. The fight lasted over an hour, and
						resulted in the sinking of the <hi rend="i">Cincinnati</hi> and <hi rend="i">Mound
							City</hi> in shoal water.</p>
					<p>The attack was made just at daybreak, and the men on the transports left their beds
						with commendable promptitude.</p>
					<p>Henry S. Fitch came to Osceola as brigade quartermaster. Le Roy Fitch was in command of
						the "Torrence," a magazine boat, belonging to the navy. George Groves, another Indiana
						boy, was on duty at one of the mortars.</p>



					<pb id="VAB9258-028" n="28"/>

					<p>Up to the 2d of June there was only the usual routine of duty. The regiment was on and
						off the boat each day.</p>
					<p>On the 3d of June, Lieutenant Brownlie was sent down the river reconoitreing. He found
						a rebel gunboat tied up, while a part of the crew was on shore, getting ice from a house
						on the bank. He surprised and captured seven of them, and brought them off under the
						fire of the gunboat. The prisoners were put on horseback, behind the soldiers, and made
						a rough voyage to the Federal camp.</p>
					<p>On the same day the major of the Forty-sixth, with three companies, was sent down near
						the fort, on the Tennessee side, with orders to construct a raft or bridge from the
						timber in a house known to be there. The bridge was to be used in crossing a creek just
						outside the fort. In the midst of the work firing commenced from the rebels, which was
						replied to by the Federal gunboats. Heavy shot went over the work and plunged into the
						timber. A narrow island, covered with a heavy growth of brush, obstructed the view of
						the river, and it could not be discovered what the cause of the attack was. Under the
						impression that the movement was discovered, the detail returned to the boat. The firing
						was occasioned by an attempt by Colonel Ellet to cut out a rebel boat, just above the
						fort. He started down with the ram <hi rend="i">Queen of the West</hi>, but failed, on
						account of the heavy fire, to reach the boat. Ellet's movement was without the knowledge
						of Commodore Foot or Colonel Fitch, and the presence of the detail was not known to
						Colonel Ellet. The unfortunate movement of the ram prevented the brigade from
						participating in an attack upon the fort, while the evacuation was in progress, for the
						rebels were all out in forty-eight hours.</p>
					<p>On the 4th, Captain Schermerhorn, with a detail, went over and completed the raft, but
						the rebels were gone.</p>
					<p>On each day from the 30th of May, information was received that the rebels were
						evacuating, and it became certain that the end of Fort Pillow was near. On the night of
						the 4th, the light of a great conflagration at the fort was witnessed from the Federal
						fleet. Evidently, a large quantity of stores was being consumed. "On the 5th, at 3 <hi
							rend="sc">A. M.</hi>, the brigade dropped cautiously down toward the fort, the little
						steamer, " Hetty Gilmore," in the lead. Arriving at the fort, the "Hetty" gave three
						whistles and all landed. The fort was entirely empty. Every thing portable, except some
						heavy guns, was burned or destroyed.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-029" n="29"/>

					<p>The gunboats and rams came down with, or shortly after, the brigade, and by daybreak
						the fort was thoroughly occupied by the invading soldiers and sailors. The flags of the
						Forty-third and Forty-sixth floated over the parapet of the fort from daylight until
						noon, when they were furled to be again given to the breeze at Memphis.</p>
					<p>Colonel Ellet, in his report to the department, says that on the evening of the 4th, he
						made a reconnoissance of the fort, going far enough down to discover that it had been
						evacuated, and that on the 5th he went down with all his rams, before daylight, and
						"planted the stars and stripes on the fort." Colonel Ellet is mistaken in his facts. Up
						to 2 o'clock of the morning of the 5th, it was not certainly known to anybody on the
						Federal side that the rebels were gone. The "Hetty Gilmore," with a portion of the
						Forty-sixth, was at the fort landing before any ram or gunboat appeared, and none of the
						fleet, except the "Hetty," came until after that boat had given the signal which had
						been arranged.</p>
					<p>On the 20th of May an accident occurred which cost Company H a man, and endangered the
						lives of three others. A scouting party was going down the road, and the major of the
						Forty-sixth, with J. H. Depoy, Charles Ross and M. L. Burson, of Company H, were taking
						a light skiff down along shore, to the opening of a lagoon. It was started out just
						above the steamboats, which were lying three or four abreast. The boat was caught in the
						current running under the transports, upset and drawn under. The major and one of the
						men caught to the gunwale of the steamer, and were drawn out by some deck hands. The
						other two were carried under the boats. Burson was drawn entirely under, and caught in
						the opposite wheel, and was saved. Depoy went clear and was lost. Five hundred men
						standing on the surrounding boats were unwilling witnesses of the scene, but were unable
						to render any assistance. After passing from under the boat, Depoy was seen going down
						the river. He struggled two or three minutes with the angry current, and finally sunk
						from view. In a few days the body was found near the mortarboats and buried.</p>
					<p>At noon, on the 5th, the brigade again started down the river, leaving Company B, of
						the Forty-sixth, to gather whatever propperty might have been left undestroyed. At
						Fulton, two twelve-pound guns were taken on board. The brigade arrived at Fort Randolph
						at dark, and found it evacuated. The boats then tied up for the night.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-030" n="30"/>

					<p>With the rams in advance, the fleet reached a point one and one-half miles above
						Memphis about 4 o'clock. Seven rebel gunboats were drawn up before the city. The ram <hi
							rend="i">Queen of the West</hi> immediately pushed ahead of the gunboats and made a
						fearful dash at three rebel boats coming up in advance of the fleet. That dash seemed to
						settle the business, for the result was so decisive that the destruction of the rebel
						fleet was unavoidable. Supported by the ram <hi rend="i">Monarch</hi>, the <hi rend="i"
							>Queen</hi> kept on her course of destruction, until, in a few minutes, the victory
						was complete. A misunderstanding about signals left three of the Federal rams virtually
						out of the contest. During the action the gunboats kept up a continuous and effective
						fire.</p>
					<p>The result of the battle was a surprising victory. Of the rebel fleet, the <hi rend="i"
							>Lovell</hi> and <hi rend="i">Little Rebel</hi> were sunk; the <hi rend="i"
							>Beauregard</hi> and <hi rend="i">Price</hi> ran into each other and were disabled;
						the <hi rend="i">"Jeff" Thompson</hi> was blown up; the <hi rend="i">Bragg</hi> and <hi
							rend="i">Sumpte</hi>r went ashore in flames; the <hi rend="i">Van Dorn</hi> ran out of
						the fight, and for the present escaped.</p>
					<p>During the fight the bluffs in front of the city were crowded with an excited
						multitude. By incessant boasting, "Jeff" Thompson had produced the impression that his
						wonderful flotilla would sweep the Federal gunboats from the river. The miserable fight
						that he made added mortification to disappointment, and when the valiant general and
						commodore mounted a convenient horse at the conclusion, and rode off for a safer place,
						his adherents gave him up.</p>
					<p>The crews of the rebel gunboats clung to the wrecks of their vessels and were picked up
						by yawls manned by Federal sailors and soldiers. The prisoners, to the number of one
						hundred, were brought to the steamer "Von Puhl" and held until night, when they were
						transferred to the "Platt Valley" and carried to Cairo. While the prisoners were being
						fished out, a band on one of the boats played "Dixie" for the comfort of the shivering
						rebels.</p>
					<p>Immediately after the fight, the transports, with the brigade, ran in and tied up. The
						levee was occupied by a dense crowd of people, of every age, sex and color. An intense
						excitement prevailed among them. The mass swayed to and fro, as the boats paddled up
						and down, endeavoring to make the landing. All were shouting. There were cheers for the
						Union and for "Jeff" Davis. Several men were knocked down. There was a great "demand for
						papers and for silver coin. Before landing, Colonel Fitch had issued orders requiring
						each company in the brigade to <pb id="VAB9258-031" n="31"/> select a particular part of
						the boat for its "company quarters," and to assemble there on call. Finally, the boats
						made their landing, and a company was sent ashore to keep back the crowd.</p>
					<p>On the 7th, Colonel Fitch appointed Captain John H. Gould provost marshal; Major J. C.
						Major, of the Forty-third, commandant of the pickets and patrols, and Major Bringhurst,
						of the Forty-sixth, commandant at Hopefield, on the Arkansas side of the river. This
						point was the eastern terminus of the Memphis &amp; Little Rock railroad, and was the
						location of extensive iron works. Three large Parrot guns, three locomotives and one
						hundred and fifty thousand dollars' worth of railroad iron were captured at this place.
						Four companies were detailed each day to patrol the city. A riot at the Grenada depot,
						on the night of the 6th, was suppressed by Company K, after severe measures became
						necessary, one man being bayonetted and two shot. On the afternoon of the 6th a
						detachment was sent up on the bluff to take down a rebel flag that was defiantly
						floating from a large pole. Great excitement existed among the mass of people that was
						present, and fearful threats were made against the men who dared to touch the flag. As a
						meeting with the civil authorities had been arranged by Colonel Fitch with the Mayor and
						City Council, at 3 o'clock, it was deemed advisable to wait until after that meeting. At
						the appointed time the meeting was held, and an arrangement was reached under which the
						municipal powers of the Mayor and Council were continued, and, with the military
						authority, undertook to enforce the law and to maintain the supremacy of the laws and
						Constitution of the United States.</p>
					<p>At 3.30, a detail of three companies of the Forty-sixth, and three from the
						Forty-third, were sent, under Major Bringhurst, to take down the obnoxious flag. The
						streets around the pole were a perfect jam. The mob cursed and taunted the soldiers, who
						made no reply. The battalion was promptly formed around the pole, and two sturdy
						wood-choppers went to work. The promised shots for the man who touched the pole did not
						come, but the pole did, and with a crash. In an instant the flag was stripped from the
						pole and taken possession of by the adjutant of the Forty-third regiment. The battalion
						was then quietly marched back to the boat.</p>
					<p>Just as the flag came down two Federal rams passed up the river, followed by the rebel
						steamship <hi rend="i">Bragg</hi> and towing the <hi rend="i">Sumpter</hi>, both manned
						by Federal crews. These were the two <pb id="VAB9258-032" n="32"/> vessels that went
						ashore on the day of the naval battle. So, all of the famous "Thompson navy" was
						destroyed or captured, except the <hi rend="i">Van Dorn</hi>.</p>
					<p>In addition to the gunboats destroyed and captured, the transports "M. R. Cheek,"
						"Victoria," "New National," "H. R. Hill" and the "Sovereign," were captured at the levee
						or on the way down. All these boats were subsequently used on White river and elsewhere
						against the rebels.</p>
					<p>On the 8th of June Company B arrived from Fort Pillow, with an "assorted cargo,"
						prominently among which was thirty hogsheads of prime sugar. Large quantities of cotton
						and sugar were found stowed away in stores and dwellings. Immense quantities of both
						articles were burned by the rebels when they found that Memphis would be taken.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained in Memphis until the 13th of June, when it shipped on the "New
						National," to take part in the expedition up White river, to convey stores to the army
						of General Curtis, which was coming down from Missouri.</p>
					<p>While at Memphis the regiment missed the boom of the cannon which, from March 4 to June
						7, had never, night or day, been out of the ears of the men.</p>

					</list>

					<p>Having all the property of the Forty-sixth on board the "New National" the night of the
						13th, at 5 o'clock the next morning the boat pushed out on the "'White River
						Expedition." The gunboat <hi rend="i">Conestoga</hi> led the way, followed by the little
						steamer "Jacob Mussleman," the "New National" and the "White Cloud," a boat loaded for
						Curtis' army. A short distance down the river the "Clara Dolson," a recently captured
						rebel steamer, was met coming up with a Federal gunboat escort. The mouth of White
						river, 181 miles below Memphis, was reached at 5 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> Going up, the
						gunboats <hi rend="i">Lexington, St. Louis</hi> and <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi> were
						overtaken and became part of the expedition. On the 16th, at 4 o'clock, the fleet
						reached within eight miles of St. Charles, where obstructions were expected. A party
						under Lieutenant Swigart was put on a tug, and another under Lieutenant Brownlie on
						shore, and instructed cautiously to go up the river and reconnoitre. The tug soon
						returned and reported rebels and boats ahead. The fleet anchored until daylight. During
						the night a raft was sent down by the rebels, which carried the "National" against the
						"White Cloud," nearly wrecking both. At 6 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi> on the 17th, the
						gunboats were under way, and the Forty-sixth was ashore, marching toward the bluff.
						Companies A and B, supported by Company G, were deployed as skirmishers. The gunboats
						laid off just below where the rebel batteries were supposed to be, and ready to open.
						The regiment pushed up over the hill and through a deadening. When within 300 yards of
						the top, the rebels and some small guns were seen. These and the infantry opened fire,
						when the regiment rushed in and drove the gunners and their supports off up toward their
						boats. Before the charge, the gunboats had commenced firing, directing their shots
						mainly at the light guns on the brow of the hill. At that time, it was not certainly
						known that there were larger guns, but, suddenly, the rebels opened with two sixty-four
						pound Parrots. In a few minutes a shot plunged into the <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi>,
						penetrated her steam chest, and immediately the boat was filled with scalding steam,
						driving the crew over the sides into the river. A hundred men were afloat. Many were so
						badly scalded that, being unable to swim, they sank. Yawls and boats pushed out from
						every boat in the fleet to the men's assistance, but the rebels came down the bank and
						fired upon the helpless sufferers in the <pb id="VAB9258-035" n="35"/> water. Then, the
						gunboats being signaled to cease firing, the Forty-sixth went in. The right of the line
						was close to the river; and, as the left swept around, it had a longer distance to
						travel, so the right was in first; but the left, swinging around, came out at the river
						in time to complete the circuit. Company A came in on the four small gun battery, and
						Company B and the left companies on the large guns.</p>
					<p>The rebels made no stand after the Forty-sixth reached the top of the hill, but fled up
						the river. Lieutenant Commanding Fry was late getting out, and was badly shot in the
						shoulder by a member of Company B. He was captured and conveyed in a yawl to the gunboat
							<hi rend="i">Conestoga</hi>, and, subsequently, to Memphis, a prisoner. Fry had been
						an officer in the Federal navy. He had a command in the rebel navy at Forts Thompson and
						Pillow, and had come to White river to fortify against the anticipated invasion by the
						Federal army. He had the <hi rend="i">Mauripas</hi> and the "Eliza G." and had commenced
						to drive piles across the river, below the fort, but was late. Some years after the
						rebellion Fry was captured in Cuba and shot by the Spanish authorities for his guerrilla
						practices. The log-book and the flag of the <hi rend="i">Mauripas</hi> were captured
						here, and are now in the possession of Colonel Fitch. Major Bringhurst secured the post
						flag.</p>
					<p>The <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi> and the "Mussleman" presented an awful spectacle.
						Fifty-eight men lay dead on the gunboat. The decks of the "Mussleman" were covered with
						men wrapped in cotton and oil. The poor creatures were scalded in every imaginable
						manner and degree. Before the "Mussleman" left for Memphis several of the wounded
						died.</p>
					<p>At night the regiment was called on to bury the dead. This, after the excessive labor
						of the day, was a hardship. One company, at first, worked at a time. Later, two were put
						on. At 2 o'clock a heavy rain began and continued until morning. The trench dug by the
						rebels for their small guns was used for a grave. The dead were carried from the <hi
							rend="i">Mound City</hi>, one by one, with all proper respect and solemnity, and
						buried in hostile soil. Later, a grateful country remembered and removed them to a
						national cemetery.</p>
					<p>When the <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi> was struck she was towed down alongside the
						"National." As she came in a man, lying on deck, in the struggles of death, took hold of
						a lanyard attached to a gun that had been made ready to fire. He pulled the string and
						discharged <pb id="VAB9258-036" n="36"/> the gun. The shot passed through the <hi
							rend="i">National</hi>, severely wounding the engineer and cutting off a steam pipe.
						The deck was covered with sick and wounded men, but, as the steam ascended, few were
						injured.</p>
					<p>On the afternoon of the 22d of June, the fleet again started up the river, and anchored
						fifteen miles above St. Charles for the night. The <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi>, with a
						guard, remained at her old anchorage. Early the next morning the fleet was again going
						up stream. At 10 o'clock the <hi rend="i">St. Louis</hi>, in the lead, was fired upon,
						and a man shot. The fleet stopped and the firing became general along the east bank. The
						gunboats threw shell and grape. The regiment used rifles. The fire was first
						concentrated on the "White Cloud," which carried two companies of the Forty-sixth, and,
						finally, on the National, which was the last boat in the line. Breastworks were made of
						cracker boxes, mattresses, hay, etc. The attack continued all day. Three men were
						killed, but none of the Forty-sixth. James Ryan, of Company H, fell overboard and was
						drowned. The same evening the fleet turned and came back to St. Charles, because of low
						water. Rebel reports from above state that fifteen rebels were killed on the up trip of
						the fleet. The "Catahoula," a former rebel transport, came up with stores and remained.
						A part of the regiment took up quarters on her.</p>
					<p>On the 22d, the body of the mate of the <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi> was found
						afloat.</p>
					<p>On the same day an expedition was sent down the river to overhaul the guerrillas. Four
						companies of the Forty-sixth went with it. It was frequently fired on, but suffered no
						loss. Nothing was effected. On the 25th the Forty-third (Colonel William E. McLean) and
						the Thirty-fourth (Captain Swain) arrived on five small boats with orders for the entire
						fleet to again go up White river. Only two gunboats went. On the 28th of June the
						reorganized expedition started up, with Colonel Fitch in command. Approaching St.
						Charles, Companies B, G and K were landed and sent up on the bluff. The place was found
						abandoned. The fleet landed at 5 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi></p>
					<p>On the 29th the fleet again put out, and went twenty-one miles above St. Charles by
						evening. Started again the next morning, and was immediately fired on. The "National"
						and the "Era" were the chief targets. Thirty balls passed through the "National." On the
						"Era" a Thirty-fourth man was killed and five wounded. Reached Clarendon. River falling.
						Boats rubbing. <pb id="VAB9258-037" n="37"/> At noon three regiments went up into town
						for parade and "muster for pay." During their absence the boat hands of the "National"
						had whisky, got into a bloody battle and nearly murdered each other. None killed. All
						wounded.</p>

					<p>A scouting party sent out on the 1st was chased in. Some lost their horses. Powell, of
						Company B, arrived without hat, coat or shoes, and Kreisher, of Company I, did not get
						in until the evening of the next day.</p>
					<p>On the 4th of July the fleet again returned to St. Charles. The National anniversary
						was celebrated by the heavy guns of the <hi rend="i">Lexington</hi> and the band of the
						Thirty-fourth regiment.</p>
					<p>On the 5th of July the fleet again turned up the river. With the <hi rend="i"
							>Lexington</hi> in the lead, the boats, in their regular order, cast loose and again
						passed up the tortuous stream. Arrived at Aberdeen deen at 3 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>
						Four companies were sent ashore to reconnoitre. Found the town abandoned. A rebel
						cavalryman was captured and taken to the boats. He confessed that he was engaged in
						firing on the boats. The gentleman announced his name as "Peopler"--Mr. Peopler. He was
						finally handed over to the <hi rend="i">Lexington</hi> for further proceedings. In the
						evening, while three or four hundred men were bathing in the river, they were fired on
						by guerrillas in the brush. The chief engineer of the <hi rend="i">Lexington</hi> was
						killed, and a number wounded. The <hi rend="i">Lexington</hi> immediately fired several
						rounds of grape into the brush, and the regiments formed for action. The firing lasted
						over an hour, and was continued at intervals all night.</p>
					<p>On the next day, Mr. Peopler was arrayed in a boatman's suit and established at a
						prominent point on the upper deck of the boat. It was supposed that his colleagues would
						pick him off, but he remained there all day, with only the injury that he received from
						the sun.</p>
					<p>On July 6, six companies of the Twenty-fourth and two from the other regiments were
						sent at 3 in the morning to attack a cavalry force, said to be on a neighboring prairie.
						The rebels were met at 6 in the evening. The action was brought on by the Twenty-fourth,
						which had put three companies in advance, leaving the remainder, with the other
						regiments, in reserve. Suddenly the rebels attacked the reserve, but, after a few
						rounds, fled. On the march out the Forty-third missed the road and did not get into
						action. A flag of truce came in, asking permission to collect the dead and wounded.
						Thirty minutes were given them for this <pb id="VAB9258-038" n="38"/> purpose. They
						gathered up their dead. The wounded were left in our hands. Their loss was eighty-four.
						On the Federal side there was one killed and twenty wounded, all in the Twenty-fourth.
						The men returned to camp at 3 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> The sick and wounded were taken
						off the boats and put in houses. All the horses went ashore and quartered in a large
						stable, where a sign read, "No Credit."</p>
					<p>At 4 o'clock the brigade was on the road for Duval's Bluff. Two howitzers were mounted
						on the fore wheels of wagons. No enemy was seen until near dark. The country was an open
						prairie, with grass waist high. The rebels kept out of reach. As the evening came on the
						men were in better spirits. The absence of the burning sun gave them strength. After
						dark the band of the Thirty-fourth played, much to the pleasure and refreshment of the
						men. Then a regiment began to sing, and the melody was taken up by the others until the
						entire column was singing, much, doubtless, to the amazement of the rebels.</p>
					<p>At 11 o'clock at night the rebel cavalry was met. The howitzers were brought up and
						fired with rounds from the entire infantry line. These, with the shouts of the men,
						seemed to unnerve the rebels, and they again fled. In less than an hour's marching the
						rebels were again found in line. An angle was formed by the Forty-third on the north and
						the Forty-sixth on the east. The howitzers were again brought up and fire opened. The
						rebels immediately broke and fled. The two regiments followed them, driving them over
						their camp and upsetting their corn-cake and molasses supper, at which they had been
						when they were called to meet the Federals.</p>

					<p>After a half hour's rest the brigade turned off for Clarendon. The march was kept up,
						with little rest, until daylight. The men were broken down. No water had been met since
						the river was left, the evening previous. At daylight there was a halt of thirty
						minutes. All dropped on the ground and slept. Resuming the march it was almost
						impossible to arouse the men. At 5 o'clock the river was made, and at 6 o'clock the
						column had reached Clarendon. The gunboats and the transports were there, and the
						regiments were soon ferried to the other side, where the order was "eat and sleep."</p>
					<p>At 3 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> orders were received to march at 6 o'clock. At 5.45 the
						regiment was in line. At 6 the transport "Q. M. D.," from Memphis, arrived. Information
						brought by her changed the programme, <pb id="VAB9258-039" n="39"/> and in two hours the
						entire expedition was steaming down the river. This was a welcome change, for the
						Forty-sixth had been reduced to 310 effective men by fatigue and sickness. John Shaffer,
						of Company A, was shot on the up trip of the "Q. M. D," and died July 12.</p>
					<p>On the 9th the "Golden Era," on which was the Twenty-fourth Regiment, struck a snag and
						sank. The horses were thrown overboard and, with the men, were saved and put upon the
						"Q. M. D." The fleet reached St. Charles on the evening of the 9th.</p>
					<p>When the regiment went up the river, on the 4th, to relieve the "White Cloud," S. N.
						Pennell, of Company B, discovered a dog near some bushes. Supposing that the animal
						might have company, he called the attention of Frederick Fitch, of Company I, who had
						charge of a gun, to the possibilities of the case. Fitch immediately let a charge of
						grape into the bushes. It was subsequently known that four guerrillas were killed and
						four wounded by the shot.</p>
					<p>At St. Charles a bill was presented Colonel Fitch, in behalf of one Colonel Belknap,
						for sundries said to have been absorbed by the regiment on the first trip. The bill was
						against the United States, and, after charging for cotton, largely, continued with
						"forty-five sheep at four dollars and fifty cents, forty Muscovy ducks at sixty cents,
						twenty dozen chickens at seven dollars and fifty cents, contents of garden two dollars,
						six calves at four dollars, etc."</p>
					<p>As Company B occupied Belknap's premises a day and a night, it was supposed that its
						members had appropriated the missing merchandise, but as each and all denied eating a
						thing during the time, and there being no proof, they were not held, and the bills are
						yet unpaid.</p>
					<p>On the 12th of July two boats, with six companies, were sent back to Clarendon, and two
						more, with six companies, went to Indian bay. A prisoner reported that General Curtis'
						army had passed Clarendon and was heading toward Helena. The detachments had been sent
						to intercept Curtis, but he had passed.</p>
					<p>The entire expedition left St. Charles for Helena between 8 and 10 o'clock on the 14th
						of July, just a month after leaving Memphis.</p>
					<p>Curtis' army as seen along the river, and hearty shouts were exchanged with them.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-040" n="40"/>

					<p>At Prairie Landing the gunboats awaited the arrival of the last boat. At dark, all
						having arrived, the entire fleet rounded Montgomery's Point, and made for Helena, where
						it arrived the next morning.</p>
					<p>The Forty-sixth was first welcomed by the Logansport company in the Ninth Illinois
						Cavalry (Captain Gifford).</p>
					<p>The sick list at this time was large. Two invoices of invalids had been sent to Memphis
						from White river. Now there were 125 on the surgeon's report.</p>
					<p>The "White River Expedition" originated in a suggestion by General Curtis, in a
						dispatch by him to General Halleck, early in June, from Batesville, the then
						headquarters of the Army of the Southwest. General Curtis suggested that supplies be
						sent him by way of White river, and that they should meet him at Des Arc. The expedition
						was organized with the consent of General Halleck, and the assistance of Major Allen,
						quartermaster at St. Louis. General Grant arrived at Memphis about the 15th of June,
						after the departure of the expedition, and heartily indorsed and seconded the movement.
						On June 26 he sent to Colonel Fitch the following order: <q rend="blockquote"><p>

					<p>The retaliatory order of Jefferson Davis against Fitch's command was issued on this
						expedition. Guerrilla bands were constantly murdering soldiers and sailors from the
						woods and bushes. They were not soldiers, but independent gangs of assassins amenable to
						no law, civil or military. On the 24th of June, Colonel Fitch reported the situation on
						White river, and his action against the guerrillas in the following:</p>

						<p>"S<hi rend="sc">IR</hi>: Subsequent to my report of the 21st inst., guerrilla bands

							gunboat Lexington. To put a stop to this barbarous warfare, Major Bringhurst was sent
							with four companies, escorted by the gunboats Cincinnati and Lexington, up Indian bay
							into the county of Monroe, where these bandits are said to be raised, with orders to
							post conspicuously copies of the accompanying notice. The expedition was successful,
							seizing some ammunition that was about to be used by those bands, and bringing in
							three prisoners, who were charged with aiding and abetting them. One of the prisoners
							(Moore) appears to be a surgeon of the Confederate army on furlough, obtained upon

					<pb id="VAB9258-042" n="42"/>

					<p>In a few days after the expedition into Monroe county, a party with a flag of truce
						came in with a communication from General Hindman, the rebel commandant of the district.
						The document claimed that all the belligerents on White river were "regulars," and
						enlisted under proper regulations, and the general claimed the right to dispose his men
						along White river as he might deem proper, "even should it prove annoying to you and
						your operations." The document concluded with the remark: "I have thought it but just
						that I should furnish you with a copy of my order, that you may act advisedly, and I
						respectfully forewarn you that should your threat be executed against any citizen of
						this district, I shall retaliate, man for man, upon the Federal officers and soldiers
						who now are, or hereafter may be, in my custody as prisoners of war."</p>
					<p>To this Colonel Fitch curtly replied, referring to the despicable character of the
						warfare waged by Hindman's guerrillas, and comparing the conduct of the garrison at St.
						Charles, in shooting the drowning men of the Federal gunboat, to the heroic behavior of
						the Federal soldiers at Memphis, in rescuing the unfortunate Confederates who were
						thrown into the river by the explosion of their vessel. Colonel Fitch's reply closed
						with the declaration: "Your threat will not deter me from executing the letter of my
						proclamation in every case in which my judgment dictates its propriety or
						necessity."</p>
					<p>Hindman seems to have reported the matter to the Confederate government, for
						immediately there came an order from Jefferson Davis to retaliate, man for man, on all
						of the officers in Colonel Fitch's command; and in his book, "The Rise and Fall of the
						Confederate Government," Davis groups Major General Hunter and General Phelps, for
						recruiting negro soldiers and "arming slaves for the murder of their masters," Major
						General B. F. Butler, who "hung an inoffensive citizen at New Orleans" (Mumford), and
						"Brigadier General G. N. Fitch" and his command, "who are reported to have murdered in
						cold blood two peaceful citizens, because one of his men, when invading our country, was
						killed by some unknown person while defending his home." Against these Mr. Davis hurled
						his anathemas, and declared them deserving the fate of felons.</p>
					<p>No officer of Fitch's command fell into rebel hands until the Red river captures,
						before which time Mr. Davis had rescinded his order as against the Forty-sixth, on the
						ground of false <pb id="VAB9258-043" n="43"/> information. Hindman's mistake occurred in
						supposing that the prisoners brought from Indian bay were killed. When the force
						returned, the captives were closely confined on a gunboat, and, as they were not
						visible, the impression was formed that they had been executed. This theory had been
						adopted by Hindman, who reported it to Richmond, highly embellished.</p>
					<p>General Hindman finally fell a victim to his favorite system of warfare. He was killed
						after the war while sitting in his house, near Helena, by an assassin who shot him
						through the window.</p>
					<p>At Helena, the army of Curtis, as well as the Forty-sixth Regiment, went into a
						thorough renovation. An entirely new outfit of horses, wagons and clothing was procured.
						Large numbers of troops were arriving from the North daily. Most of them were "new men,"
						dressed in new clothes, and with all the material necessary for good service. If they
						felt any above their ragged brethren, they were sufficiently sensible to conceal the
						feeling.</p>
					<p>On the 1st of August the entire Vicksburg fleet came up the river. In a few days the
						regiment moved to the "Pillow Farm," a few miles below Helena. The general and his
						family were absent. The place was well stocked and in charge of a faithful negro. And
						the agent was something of a financier. He had disposed of much of the portable stuff
						about the farm at fair prices, taking pay in "Northern Indiana railroad" money, which he
						expected would be redeemed by the cashier, "Sallie Miller," then on the road to
						Helena.</p>
					<p>On the 3d of August the Forty-third and Forty-sixth, with an Indiana battery and the
						First Arkansas Infantry, were sent against a rebel force said to be west of Helena.
						Subsequently the Fifth Illinois was added to the force, and all of it was merged into
						the division of General A. P. Hovey, numbering 3,000 men. An action had taken place the
						day before, and it was supposed that a large rebel force was assembling for an attack
						upon the post. The march was exhausting from the heat and dust. Many fell out, and,
						during the first two days, several went back to the river. The column went to Clarendon
						in four days, remained there five days and returned in four days. The return march was
						not fatiguing, as it was cooler. Met no rebels except the usual guerrilla squads. Much
						of the ground traveled had been gone over before. Four men were killed, two of whom
						belonged to the Thirty-fourth Indiana.</p>
					<p>About the 20th a steamer, coming down the Mississippi river, <pb id="VAB9258-044"
							n="44"/> struck a bar and was wrecked. It had on board some 200 soldiers returning to
						their regiments. Very nearly all were drowned. Henry Saylors, of Company K, was among
						the lost. Some two weeks afterward, Saylors' body was found in the river, near the camp
						of the Forty-sixth. It had floated forty miles and stopped near his company's
						quarters.</p>
					<p>On the 2d of September, Colonel Fitch, having resigned, took formal leave of the
						regiment. He resigned in consequence of an injury that disabled him for service. He had
						accepted leave of absence to await the action of the department commander on his
						resignation.</p>
					<p>Just before the colonel left, the regiment was paraded, and he addressed the men in a
						speech, referring to the fact that in marches, camps, bivouacs, in encounters with the
						enemy, he had been with them for nearly a year. He said he had to take leave of them
						from necessity. That his absence might be brief or continued, as circumstances might
						determine, but, with the regiment or at home, his best efforts should be used in behalf
						of it or its members. He enjoined upon men and officers that they be kind to one
						another, and remember that what discipline they were under was necessary for their
						welfare and for the efficiency of the regiment. He said he left the men under the charge
						of capable and considerate officers, and he hoped that the future of the regiment might
						be as bright as its past. It had won a name creditable to our State, and honorable even
						among enemies. Its members were enjoined to do nothing that might tarnish the good name
						of the regiment nor the honor of our State. At the conclusion the regiment gave three
						hearty cheers for Colonel Fitch. The departure of the colonel was regretted by all the
						members of the regiment. His care of the men endeared him to all. His discipline was
						recognized as an essential element in the regiment's subsequent efficiency, and, in
						after years, his successor cheerfully acknowledged that the education of the regiment to
						its after capacity, was largely due to the early discipline of its first colonel.</p>
					<p>The regiment was at Helena, Ark., from July 15, 1862, until April 9, 1863; nearly nine
						months. During that time it was engaged in various and numberless expeditions, and
						fights and skirmishes with guerrillas. It was on White river four times; to Duval's
						Bluff twice; to Arkansas Post; down the Tallehatchie; east from Helena to Moon lake,
						Yazoo Pass and other points of less note. The history of the regiment is the history of
						the war <pb id="VAB9258-045" n="45"/> in Arkansas during that time, for it was with and
						generally at the head of nearly all of the important expeditions that went out. The
						brief summary of the regiment's duties given at or from Helena, during the period
						indicated, is all that is here necessary.</p>
					<p>Martin L. Rutter, of Company A, was killed, and Daniel Samsel, of Company D, was
						wounded, by guerrillas, October 26, 1862. Two men of the Forty-third were killed the
						same day.</p>
					<p>S. C. Levin was elected sutler, October 27.</p>
					<p>On November 5 the regiment sent a scouting party seven miles further west than had
						before been reached.</p>
					<p>Three companies of the regiment, with others, went on a scout forty miles up the river,
						on the 1st of November. Found no rebels, but the people were excited about the new money
						that they saw for the first time. Large importations of "Northern Indiana railroad"
						money were still being made. It was handled by an individual in Logansport, who sold it
						to persons who sent it South. It arrived in sheets, unsigned, and was filled up
						according to the fancy of the purchaser. That about Helena bore the names, "M. M. Post,"
						"Alex. Barnett," "Sallie Miller," "Dan Pratt," "D. D. Dykeman," "Molly Thomas," etc.,
						etc. It had, for a time, a great run, but the officers stamped it out. Latterly it
						circulated only away from camp. Expeditions used it largely. Those found offering it
						were court martialed and fined. On one occasion a man belonging to one of the new Iowa
						regiments came into the quarters of the Forty-sixth and offered one of the contraband
						notes for a watch. The amazing audacity of the man was admired for a while, when the
						verdant financier was hooted from camp.</p>

					<p>Hamilton Robb, of Carroll county, was elected chaplain by the officers, on the 5th of
						November. He was commissioned December 13.</p>
					<p>On November 15, Colonel Slack, Lieutenant Colonel Gould and Thomas O. Riley were
						appointed a board of trade. The board was supposed to regulate the purchase of
						cotton.</p>
					<p>On November 15 the entire division went on an expedition to Arkansas Post. It returned
						to Helena on the 22d. No results.</p>
					<p>The great "Tallehatchie Expedition" started on the 26th of November, 1862. It was
						composed of not less than 5,000 men, with a splendid outfit of artillery and cavalry.
						The expedition went on boats down to the "Delta," a small town on the Mississippi side
						of the river. At 5 o'clock on the 29th the army started. <pb id="VAB9258-046" n="46"/>
						There was a train of 160 wagons, a regiment of cavalry, and a number of batteries of
						artillery. A march of twenty-four miles was made by dark. On the 30th of November the
						rebels were seen near a ferry on Coldwater. A bridge was built and the troops crossed
						over on the 31st. No rebels could be found. The return march was begun on the 2d
						ofJanuary. Crossing the Tallehatchie, great numbers of negroes followed and remained
						with the column until the Mississippi was reached. Early on the morning of the last day
						the boom of the morning gun at Helena was heard, and loud shouts proclaimed the joy of
						the soldiers in being within hearing distance of Colonel Slack and his artillery. The
						Forty-sixth reached the river at 8.30 A. M., and was in Helena by 3.30 P. M.</p>
					<p>On the 1st of January, 1863, the following detail for artillery duty was made from the
						Forty-sixth regiment. It was assigned by Captain P. Davidson, chief of artillery, to the
						Sixteenth Ohio Battery, Captain Mitchell, and did good service:</p>
					<p>Company A, Henry C. Canter, Thomas W. Patton; Company B, John N. Oliver, Warren L.
						Wagoner; Company C, Henry A. Graham, Jacob Rutter; Company D, William H. Powell; Company
						E, Benjamin F. Shoup; Company F, Patrick Callahan; Company G, James Johnson, Colon
						McColloch; Company H, John Chamberlain; Company I, Allen Calhoun, Richard Calhoun;
						Company K, David Haller.</p>
					<p>The regiment started, on the 10th of January, on another trip up White river. It
						reached St. Charles on the 15th, and remained until the 18th, when it continued on up to
						Clarendon and Duval's Bluff. It met no old friends and made no new acquaintances. The
						return was begun on the 19th, and Helena was made on the 22d. The regiment went into
						camp a mile back from the river. The mud was overwhelming. It was reported that a mule
						and a horse were drowned near the center of the town. The sick report of the post
						reached 1,200. Surgeon Horace Coleman was acting "medical director" for the
						division.</p>
					<p>On the 14th of February the regiment started on the "Yazoo Pass Expedition." An opening
						was cut in the levee, and in a transport the regiment passed into Moon lake, an immense
						pond hemmed in by the higher land back and the levee on the Mississippi. A landing was
						made on a comparatively dry spot, where the remains of an old mill stood. It was
						entitled, "Hunt's Mills," and McAllister, of Company I, and Haney, of Company B, took
							<pb id="VAB9258-047" n="47"/> the establishment in hand, and in a few days turned out
						large quantities of a good article of corn-meal.</p>
					<p>On arriving at the "Mills" the regiment went into camp, expecting to be comfortable for
						a few days, but the sudden rise of the water, caused by the river rushing through the
						opening in the levee, overflowed nearly the entire country, and left scarcely enough dry
						land to camp upon.</p>
					<p>Some work was done on this visit to Moon lake in cutting out trees and obstructing
						timbers, but before much in that line was effected the regiment was ordered back to
						Helena, where it arrived on the 21st of February.</p>
					<p>On landing, orders were received to prepare to embark on the "Volunteer" and "Ida May"
						at 3 o'clock. Although tired and hungry, the men immediately prepared to ship, but
						before the appointed hour orders came "to wait for pay." This order was obeyed, and the
						regiment marched up to the Exchange hotel, was paid for two months, and was back on the
						boats by 10 o'clock in splendid spirits.</p>
					<p>On the "Moon Lake Expedition" three rebels were killed and six wounded. Aurilius L.
						Voorhis and George W. Bruington, of Company B, were wounded by guerrillas.</p>
					<p>The real "Tallehatchie Expedition" was now to begin. General Ross commanded. He took
						the "Volunteer" for his flagship, and, with the Forty-sixth, took the lead. Companies A,
						C, E, G, H and K were on the "Ida May," and Companies B, F, D and I on the "Volunteer."
						The expedition was composed of new troops, except the Forty-third, Forty-sixth and the
						Forty-seventh Indiana. The gunboats <hi rend="i">Chillicothe</hi> and <hi rend="i"
							>DeKalb</hi> were in advance, followed by fifteen transports and the ram <hi rend="i"
							>Fulton</hi>. The fleet went crashing through trees and limbs, tearing off the
						chimneys and upper works of the boats. Huge trees were cut down and rolled out of the
						way, and great piles of brush and timber blocked the road until removed. The fleet made
						from two to five miles a day, and often at night the starting point of the morning was
						in sight. The boats were nearly wrecked. The smoke stacks were knocked down and the
						upper works torn off. The "Volunteer" was a new boat, just from Pittsburg. She was
						highly decorated and in perfect order. After coming through the pass she looked like an
						abandoned scow.</p>

					<p>The brigade consisted of the Forty-third, Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh Indiana, and
						the Twenty-eighth Wisconsin, under <pb id="VAB9258-048" n="48"/> General Soloman. In
						addition, there were the Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth Missouri, the Thirty-third,
						Thirty-sixth and Twenty-ninth Iowa, six guns of the Third Iowa Artillery and one company
						of an Illinois cavalry regiment, under General Clinton B. Fisk. General Ross commanded
						the whole.</p>
					<p>The Tallehatchie was reached and better sailing had. Evidence of the presence of the
						rebels began to be seen. The transport "Thirty-fifth Parallel" was passed in flames. She
						was filled with cotton and was burned to keep the property from falling into Federal
						hands. All night a constant stream of burning cotton floated past the fleet, keeping all
						hands busy saving the boats from conflagration.</p>
					<p>The fleet reached within two miles of the fortifications on the 11th of March. The
						Forty-sixth was immediately detailed to disembark and proceed toward the town of McNutt,
						to ascertain whether an infantry force was there, as reported. The Forty-seventh was
						ordered down the river toward the fort. Being near the left of the column, it was late
						reporting. The Forty-sixth having returned, Colonel Bringhurst asked permission of the
						adjutant of General Ross to go on down the river and wait for Colonel Slack. Permission
						being given, the regiment went down to within three-quarters of a mile of the fort, and,
						seeing the rebel infantry outside, advanced and attacked them. Companies A and B were
						detailed as skirmishers. The rebels stood, and an engagement at once came on. The whole
						line became engaged, and after some sharp firing the rebels took to the fort. In the
						mean time the <hi rend="i">Chillicothe</hi>, with General Ross on board, dropped down
						the stream. Coming in sight of the fort the rebels opened on the gunboat with two
						sixty-eight-pound guns, making the splinters fly.</p>
					<p>General Ross had landed and was with the regiment before the infantry engagement was
						over, and complimented it for its behavior.</p>
					<p>Returning, the regiment met the Forty-seventh coming down, and, although the
						Forty-sixth had taken the place assigned to Colonel Slack, he joined General Ross in
						complimenting the regiment.</p>
					<p>Samuel Stewart was shot through the groin, and Theophilus P. Rodgers in the leg; both
						of Company B.</p>
					<p>On the 6th of March an accident occurred which cost the regiment one of its best
						members. A light boat containing a staff officer of General Ross, a clerk, Artemus
						Burnsworth, and B. <pb id="VAB9258-049" n="49"/> Porter, of Company I, left the
						"Volunteer" on an errand to the shore. The fleet was under good headway and, on
						returning, the boat missed the "Volunteer" and made for the "Ida May." The steamer ran
						down the boat and passed over it. Burnsworth and Porter went entirely under the "Ida
						May." Porter was taken up by a yawl. Burnsworth was seen no more. The other two men were
						hauled aboard the steamer.</p>
					<p>On the 12th of March a general attack was made on the fort. Soloman's brigade was
						placed between the river and the land battery erected a few days before, and to the
						right of that battery. The gunboats came slowly down the river, and, coming in range of
						the fort, opened with their heavy bow-guns. The land battery also opened. Immediately
						the fort was heard from, and in no uncertain way. Their shells were sent in showers over
						the boats and the land battery. The rebels had a sixty-eight-pound gun, which was
						particularly effective. One of its shells passed through the shutter of the <hi rend="i"
							>Chillicothe</hi> and exploded in the gun-room, killing three and fatally wounding
						nine men. During the engagement the cotton bales on the upper deck of the <hi rend="i"
							>Chillicothe</hi> took fire, when a squad of negro firemen went up with hose and
						extinguished the flames. The <hi rend="i">Chillicothe</hi> carried an 168-pound gun,
						whose shell could entirely penetrate a bale of cotton or the thickest bank of the fort,
						and threatened the destruction of their works, but the boat could not hold position long
						enough to effect what was possible under other circumstances.</p>

					<p>On the 16th another attack was made, with the same result.</p>
					<p>On the 19th Wright Nield had an arm shot off while "looking out" for a rebel gun that
						was firing at a working squad. Nield saw the gun fire and gave the word, but before he
						could get down the ball struck him. He subsequently died.</p>
					<p>On the 19th the fleet started to return. Much time was lost in the dark by the boats
						becoming entangled, which might have been fatal had the rebels understood the
						situation.</p>
					<p>Met General Quimby, with reinforcements, on the 21st of March. The entire expedition
						was ordered to return and the old positions were reached, and on the 23d the Forty-sixth
						was again sent down in advance. Approaching the fort, two large yawls, filled with men,
						were seen making off from the shore. The balls of the advance compelled one party to
						halt; the other escaped. The captured yawl contained fourteen men.</p>
					<p>On the 23d a tree fell across a tent in the camp of the Forty-seventh, <pb
							id="VAB9258-050" n="50"/> killing four and fatally injuring two men. James Storms, of
						Logansport, was one of the wounded.</p>
					<p>On the night of the 31st of March, Companies B and D stood picket within 200 yards of
						the rebels.</p>
					<p>A party of rebels came in with a flag of truce on April 1. Their alleged business was
						about a prisoner, but they really wanted to see what was being done on our side. They
						were held back a proper distance. Captain Sikes, the officer, was exceedingly sociable,
						and sat and talked an hour with our officers. In return, the next day our colonel, with
						a flag and four men, went over to see what they were doing. They had more success than
						the rebels, and learned much about their position.</p>
					<p>Quartermaster Downey, when down near the fort, on the 4th of April, was struck in the
						hand by a rebel shell. The colonel, with some men, was in a battery destroying the sacks
						that had been used in the work. The shot was drawn by them. On the same day, at the same
						place, a twelve-pound shell passed through a group of Company K's men. They were sitting
						around a tree. William Johnson was killed and Elihu Shaffer wounded. When the report of
						the gun was heard, Johnson gathered his knees to his body. The shell blew out its fuse
						and passed entirely through his knees and body. The brass fuse went through Shaffer's
						hand.</p>
					<p>The fleet again started for Helena on the 5th of April. The Forty-sixth occupied the
						"Volunteer" alone. On the 6th a captain of a boat and a soldier of the Forty-third were
						killed by guerrillas. A large plantation house in the vicinity was in flames in a few
						minutes.</p>
					<p>The regiment arrived at Helena on the 8th of April.</p>

					<p>On the arrival of the regiment at Helena, it was met by General Hovey, who ordered the
						Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh to remain on their boats, as they were to go to
						Vicksburg.</p>
					<p>On the evening of the 11th the "Volunteer," with the regiment, dropped down the river a
						few miles, with orders to watch and follow the "Universe," the flagboat of the general.
						It rained heavily all night. The next morning (Sunday) the men were busy drying and
						cleaning up. The chaplain was having religious services when the "Universe" passed down,
						with colors flying. The sermon was cut off, and in twenty minutes the regiment was on
						board and steaming down the river. The river was very high. At 4 o'clock the "Volunteer"
						was off White river, and at 5 she passed Napoleon, at the mouth of the Arkansas. At 8
						o'clock the "Volunteer" overhauled three boats that had been ahead. At 10 o'clock all
						the leading boats were overhauled at anchor. The "Volunteer" was ordered to take the
						lead, as she "was the only boat that had a competent pilot." Accordingly she steamed on
						down.</p>
					<p>The boat was full of men. All the decks were covered with <pb id="VAB9258-054" n="54"/>
						sleeping soldiers, and the night was dark. The river was out of its banks, and, in some
						places, three or four miles wide. The danger of getting out of the channel, or on the
						bars, was great, and the colonel, feeling the responsibility of the situation, went with
						the captain to the pilot to ascertain how far that official could be relied on. It was
						discovered that the pilot was a member of the First Indiana Cavalry, and had been on
						that part of the river only once before, and then on a coal barge.</p>
					<p>The "Volunteer" ran many risks, and, at 2 o'clock, after rubbing several sandbars, came
						to anchor without orders, and by 3 o'clock the whole fleet was huddled around her. At
						daybreak the boat was again under way, and at 6 o'clock tied up near the quarters of
						General Grant.</p>
					<p>After breakfast the "Volunteer," under orders, was unloaded and the property carried up
						on dry ground. In a few hours orders came to put everything on the boat again. That was
						done. The next morning the boat moved a short distance up the river and the regiment
						went into camp.</p>
					<p>The point where the army was concentrating was at Milliken's Bend, twenty miles above
						Vicksburg.</p>
					<p>All baggage, except what could be carried, was ordered back to the boats. The division
						had no wagons except for ammunition. All else was put on the steamers "Cheeseman" and
						"Cerlew," to be carried past the rebel batteries at Vicksburg. The stores were put on
						the boats without any regard to method or order. Things were piled up just as they were
						brought in, and worse confusion could not have been constructed.</p>
					<p>On the 16th of April the division began its march. The Twenty-fourth led the column,
						followed by the Forty-sixth, with the Sixteenth Ohio Battery between them. Richmond was
						reached before dark, and the regiment remained over night. Marched at 6.30 on the 17th.
						Reached Dawson's plantation at 4 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> Weather exceedingly hot.
						Knapsacks were relieved by the discharge of overcoats and superfluous clothing. The
						splendid mansion of "Mars" Dawson was soon filled by a hot and hungry soldiery. The
						rooms were all taken. During the night terrific firing was heard in the direction of
						Vicksburg. Supposing the transports, with their baggage, were passing the batteries on
						the little steamers, the Forty-sixth people expressed some uneasiness.</p>
					<p>Left the plantation on the 21st of April. The division had built bridges additional to
						those built by the engineers, and had a <pb id="VAB9258-055" n="55"/> road to itself.
						Encamped that night on Dunbar's plantation. The weatherboarding of the mansion was used
						for bedding. Built a bridge on the 22d, and enjoyed heavy rains for four days. Marched,
						on the 27th, at noon, over heavy roads, and stopped two miles from the river. Remained a
						short time, and pushed on through the rain to the river. The division went into camp and
						remained until noon on the 28th. The regiment was marched a short distance down the
						river and exercised in pumping out two coal barges that had been perforated in passing
						the batteries.</p>

					<p>At 5 o'clock the Eleventh, Twenty-fourth and Forty-sixth were put on the "Forest Queen"
						and a coal barge on each side of her. Every foot of room was covered. By dark the entire
						division was loaded on five transports and the coal barges. At 8 o'clock General Hovey
						assembled the colonels of the division in the cabin of the "Forest Queen" and explained
						to them the proposed movement. The division was to be on boats and barges opposite the
						rebel fort. The gunboats were to silence the batteries, when the infantry was to run
						over, land and secure a footing at, the base of the fort. The transports were then to
						return for additional troops. Governor Yates, of Illinois, was present at this meeting.
						The colonels were directed to assemble their company officers and instruct them in their
						duties.</p>
					<p>The division started at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 29th, and reached Hard Times at
						6. The boats tied up nearly opposite the great fort of Grand Gulf. It was not then
						visible through the mist, but in an hour it was in plain view. The sight was
						interesting, but not comforting. It was a huge sugar loaf hill, with a plane at its
						base, some twenty feet above the river. Not a man or a gun could be seen. The river
						seemed to run straight against the fort, while Black river came into the Mississippi
						close to its right.</p>
					<p>At 8 o'clock all was ready. The division was on its boats. The gunboats were at anchor
						in the stream. The <hi rend="i">Louisville</hi>, <hi rend="i">Lafayette</hi>, <hi
							rend="i">Benton</hi>, <hi rend="i">Pittsburg</hi>, <hi rend="i">Mound City</hi>, <hi
							rend="i">Carondelet</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Price</hi> were in the fleet. Admiral
						Porter was on the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi>, General McClernand on the <hi rend="i"
							>Price</hi>, and General Grant was on a little tug in the middle of the river. On a
						signal from the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi> the fleet weighed anchor and stood up stream.
						Going up a mile, the boats turned and came down in line of battle. By this time the sun
						was high enough to expose the fort to its direct rays, and, from the transports, a
						distinct view could be had of every movement, <pb id="VAB9258-056" n="56"/> and for over
						five hours the Thirteenth Corps looked upon one of the grandest sights ever
						witnessed.</p>
					<p>The attack failing to silence the enemy's guns, signals were made for the division to
						land. The corps was then marched along the levee past the fort. Below, it went into
						camp. By morning, the entire corps, with two of Logan's brigades, about 20,000 men, were
						ready for the march for Vicksburg. During the night the transports and gunboats ran past
						the batteries. The rebel cannonading shook the ground the soldiers slept upon.</p>
					<p>Officers of the regiment, who subsequently visited the fort, say that the plateau was
						very broad, and completely commanded by rifle trenches wide enough to shelter four ranks
						of infantry, and with many pieces of light artillery. The time necessary for the
						transports to unload and return for reinforcements would have been sufficient to
						annihilate the first detatchments, and, probably, most of the succeeding ones. In view
						of subsequent events, it was, perhaps, fortunate that the heavy rebel guns were not
						silenced.</p>
					<p>At 5 o'clock on the morning of the 30th of April the regiment "mustered for pay," and,
						in an hour, with the Twenty-fourth Indiana, was marching on the <hi rend="i"
						>Benton</hi>. The Eleventh went on the Lafayette. On the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi>, the
						Twenty-fourth occupied the upper deck and the Forty-sixth the lower or gun deck.</p>
					<p>At 8 o'clock the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi> ran up a signal and put out into the stream.
						She was immediately followed by all the gunboats, transports and barges--all heavily
						laden with infantry and artillery. As the fleet rounded out, a band at the quarters of
						General Grant played "The Red, White and Blue." The cheers from the boats and the shore,
						the heavy masses of soldiers on the vessels, with the busy preparations on the gunboats
						for action, produced impressions on the spectators that will never be forgotton.</p>
					<p>On the wheel-house of the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi> stood General Grant and Commodore
						Porter, closely watching the shore. Nothing, however, was visible on land that indicated
						that the enemy was prepared for the movement. The decks were covered with anxious
						soldiers, the guns were cleared for action, and the crews were at quarters. Opposite
						Bruinsburg the <hi rend="i">Benton</hi> signaled, "Prepare to land," and slowly rounded
						to. As soon as the boat reached the bank the Forty-sixth and Twenty-fourth Indiana were
						on shore--the first to land. Only one man was seen on the bank. He was supposed to be a
						spy of General Grant's and was sent on board. <pb id="VAB9258-057" n="57"/> Two day's
						rations, to do five, were issued and speedily distributed. There was such haste that
						many companies were obliged to roll their provisions along as they marched. A rapid
						movement was begun. The roads were crowded. At first there was much confusion, but
						gradually the advance became orderly and rapid.</p>
					<p>There were no horses in the column, except those with the artillery. The officers
						walked with the men. The regiment snatched a few minutes and got supper at 8 o'clock.
						Marched, with many halts, all night. At 5 o'clock <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi>, the 1st of
						May, the colonel took advantage of a halt and ordered the men to prepare breakfast. It
						was fortunate, for it was many hours before another opportunity occurred. Before the
						heavy eaters were through heavy firing began, and the order came to go forward. The
						regiment was in line instantly, and pushed to the front. Rudely jostling an old colonel,
						he said, "You'll get there in time, boys." And many of them did. The road was gorged
						with infantry and artillery--all crowding to the front. The regiment went with the tide,
						and in a few minutes was engaged in battle.</p>
					<p>This point was four miles from Port Gibson, and the result of the engagement would
						determine the campaign. Crossing a chasm, the Forty-sixth became separated from the
						other regiments of the brigade, and came out on a plain near the Magnolia church, where
						it was ordered by General McGinnis to support the Eighteenth Indiana, which was being
						heavily pressed. About that time the Forty-sixth joined the other part of the brigade,
						and and took part in the first charge. The Eighteenth was fighting the Fifteenth
						Arkansas and the Twenty-first and Twenty-third Alabama. A battery of two guns was in
						front, within an hundred yards. In the charge on the rebel infantry, the Forty-sixth
						went through, breaking the rebel lines. Company E captured the colors of the Fifteenth
						Arkansas, and a portion of Company H ran over the colors of the Twenty-third Alabama.
						Captain Henry Snyder and James M. McBeth, of Company E, fired upon and wounded the
						color-bearer of the Fifteenth Arkansas. McBeth took the colors, but inadvertantly let
						them pass into the hands of some Thirty-fourth men, who had come up. Portions of the
						Eleventh, Thirty-fourth and Forty-sixth Indiana charged upon and captured the battery.
						This capture has been claimed by each regiment, severally, but it was their joint work.
						Whoever did the work, it was well done. Every horse and every man about the first gun
						was killed. It was then turned, and, being loaded, fired upon the rebels.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-058" n="58"/>

					<p>After an hour's rest the regiment was ordered forward and to the right. It crossed the
						Port Gibson road and formed on a bare hill. Artillery went into battery. Immediately the
						line was opened on from the woods in front, where a new rebel line had been formed. A
						part of the Forty-sixth and some artillery were sent down and the rebels dispersed. At
						5.30 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> our line was withdrawn, and the men laid down and
						slept.</p>

					<p>At 4.30 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi> on the 2d, the army was in motion, and at 8 o'clock
						the regiment stacked arms in one of the streets of Port Gibson. It remained in town
						until the next evening, and enjoyed a well earned rest.</p>
					<p>In the movement from the river, the regiment's behavior pleased its friends and
						satisfied the general officers.</p>
					<p>The killed and wounded of the regiment were:</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-059" n="59"/>

					<p>On the 4th of May, Lieutenant Troxell, of Company C, was detailed to act as adjutant,
						in place of Watts, and Lieutenant Brownlie, of Company D, as quartermaster, in place of
						Downey.</p>
					<p>On the 3d of May the Forty-third and Forty-sixth went on a scout. They found large
						quantities of provisions. At one place they discovered 180,000 pounds of hams and side
						meat. It had been hauled out by the rebels on the day of the battle. Large quantities of
						stores had been burned. The division encamped, on the night of the 3d, seventeen miles
						from Vicksburg and twenty-five from Grand Gulf. A halt of several days was made for
						stores. Generals Grant, Sherman, Logan and McClernand reviewed the division on the 7th.
						On the 8th was the " Big Wash," when the army, after a busy month in the mud and water,
						met the first opportunity to clean up.</p>
					<p>The division left the camp near Edward's Depot on May 11. Marched eight miles and
						remained until the 12th at 3 <hi rend="sc">A. M.</hi>, when it took up the march for
						Vicksburg. The first day the road was hot and dusty. Artillery and infantry, with
						thousands of negro men, women and children, were hurrying forward. Met the enemy at 9
						o'clock. The Twelfth Division was in advance. The Twenty-fourth and the Forty-sixth were
						in front. Companies A, B and C were out as skirmishers. The two regiments pushed ahead
						and found the rebels in a wood, with a broad, clear field between the forces. On the
						advance of the regiments the rebels fell back to their supports.</p>
					<p>The line of march was taken up on the 12th. Before starting each man took eighty rounds
						of cartridges and some crackers. The sick were put in ambulances, and, with the wagons,
						sent around by another road. At 10 o'clock every possible demonstration for an intended
						battle had been made by General Grant, but, while they were going on, a road was being
						cut through the woods, which let the Thirteenth Corps out on another, around the rebel
						left. Four miles were made by 4 o'clock, when the division went into camp. The lot of
						the Forty-sixth fell on a newly plowed field, which, under the heavy rain, soon became a
						pond.</p>
					<p>At 4 o'clock, on the 14th, orders came for a march at 4.30. At 8 o'clock the rain
						recommenced. Reached Raymond at 11. The town was full of rebel prisoners and large
						details were burying the dead of Logan's battle on the 12th. Camped on the night of the
						14th, three and one-half miles from the Vicksburg railroad, and fifteen miles from
						Jackson.</p>



					<pb id="VAB9258-060" n="60"/>

					<p>Started at 5 o'clock on the morning of the 15th. Fine weather. Good traveling. Reached
						Clinton, on the railroad, at 8 o'clock. Again met the rebels, formed line of battle,
						when they again left. The pickets were busy all night. Many prisoners were brought
						in.</p>
					<p>Was on the road again at 5 o'clock on the morning of the 16th. Picked up rebel
						stragglers at every step. Companies H and I were put out on the flanks of the column,
						and captured a large number of rebel prisoners who had fallen behind on the retreat of
						their army from Jackson.</p>
					<p>Three miles from Bolton, the column again struck the rebel lines. The Twelfth Division
						was in advance, and the First Brigade was in the lead. The Twenty-fourth (Colonel
						Spicely) was in front, then the Sixteenth Ohio Battery, with the Forty-sixth following.
						Approaching a fine plantation (Champion's), where the road ran into a hilly woods, a
						number of field officers were riding in front of the Twenty-fourth, when Sergeant David
						Wilky, of the First Indiana Cavalry, coming from the front, reported lines of infantry
						and artillery within 600 yards. The Forty-sixth was ordered up in front of the battery,
						and a line of battle was immediately formed. The Twenty-fourth formed on the right of
						the road and the Forty-sixth on the left. The Second Ohio Battery rested on the right of
						the Twenty-fourth, and the Sixteenth Ohio Battery on the left of the Forty-sixth, and
						between that regiment and the Eleventh Indiana. But General Grant was not yet ready for
						the battle. The several columns of the army were on different roads and rapidly
						concentrating. But two brigades of one corps, the Thirteenth, were yet on the
						ground.</p>
					<p>At 11.45 General Grant, supposing the other columns on the other roads were in
						supporting distance, gave General Hovey the order to advance. The Forty-sixth quickly
						went forward, and formed line of battle on the left of the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin. On
						its left were the Eleventh and Thirty-fourth Indiana. The Twenty-fourth was on the
						extreme right. The batteries followed close. A halt was made until 12.15, when the
						actual advance began. The order was first received on the right of the line, and it, in
						moving forward, obliqued to the left, compelling the Forty-sixth to move also to the
						left, crowding the Eleventh. That regiment not being able to give room, the Forty-sixth
						was finally compelled to occupy ground in the rear of the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin. In
						that situation the brigade advanced, and sharp <pb id="VAB9258-061" n="61"/> firing
						commenced by the whole line. The brigade advanced in fine order and drove the rebels
						back over their batteries in confusion. The rebels crossed a small ravine, and again
						formed. Here was a desperate fight. The whole brigade advanced and a close conflict
						ensued. On the left, the Second Brigade, under Colonel Slack, had similar work on hand.
						Before this general encounter, the Eleventh sent for help, and General McGinnis directed
						the Forty-sixth to relieve it. The Eleventh was found nearly flanked on both sides and
						heavily pressed. The Forty-sixth came on the ground in good time, and, joining the
						Eleventh, forced the rebels back.</p>
					<p>The struggle on the first hill was kept up over an hour with varying results. Several
						guns were captured, three of them by the Forty-sixth, which were again captured by the
						rebels. It was uncertain, at the end of the hour, where the victory would finally be.
						The fight began too early. Many divisions were yet upon the road, and calls for help
						were unheeded. The larger portion of the Thirteenth (McClernand's) Corps heard the
						thunder of the battle and loitered. During the heaviest fighting by Hovey's division,
						that general received an order from McClernand to join him some three miles back. In his
						"Memoirs," General Grant says: "The battle of Champion's Hill lasted about four hours,
						hard fighting, preceded by two or three hours of skirmishing, some of which almost rose
						to the dignity of battle. Every man of Hovey's division, and of McPherson's two
						divisions, was engaged during the battle. No other part of my command was engaged at
						all, except as described before." General Grant attributes the failure to prevent
						Pemberton from getting back to Vicksburg to McClernand's delay.</p>
					<p>The most desperate and protracted of the Forty-sixth's fighting was near and around a
						log cabin, and near where the guns were captured. Here the tide of battle ebbed and
						flowed. The ground was lost and won. The First Brigade would press forward, victors,
						only to be driven back, to again advance in pursuit. Here many of the regiment fell.
						Near the cabin, Welch and Laquear, of Company D; Mellinger, of Company I; Lieutenant
						Ferris, of Company F, and William Pfoutz, of Company B, fell. The balls showered about
						that cabin, and the wonder was that so many escaped.</p>
					<p>The success of Logan's division on the right settled the question for that day. When
						Hovey's division saw the masses of <pb id="VAB9258-062" n="62"/> rebel prisoners
						crowding to the rear, it knew why the enemy on its front was giving way. The victory was
						won.</p>
					<p>The Sixteenth Ohio Battery, containing a large detail from the Forty-sixth, did good
						service. It occupied a position of great responsibility and danger. Its gallant
						commander, Captain Mitchell, was killed.</p>
					<p>In his report of the battle of Champion's Hill, General Hovey thus speaks of the First
						Brigade, near the cabin: "The contest here was continued for over an hour by my forces.
						For over 600 yards up the hill my division gallantly drove the enemy before them,
						capturing eleven guns and over 300 prisoners under fire. The Eleventh Indiana (Colonel
						McCauley) and Twenty-ninth Wisconsin (Colonel Gill) captured the four guns on the brow
						of the hill, at the point of the bayonet. The Forty-sixth Indiana (Colonel Bringhurst)
						gallantly drove the enemy from three guns on the right of the road, and Colonel Bynam,
						with the Twenty-fourth Iowa, charged a battery of five guns on the left of the road,
						killing gunners and horses and capturing several prisoners." * *</p>
					<p>The brigade was ordered at the close of the battle to get a supply of cartridges and
						finish the fight, or take part in the pursuit.</p>
					<p>Divisions coming up which had not been in the engagement were sent forward, and the
						Twelth Division prepared for supper and rest.</p>

					<p>The spot where the division was to camp was situated in a light wood, near the road,
						but it was preoccupied. It was covered with dead and wounded men. Rebel and Union
						soldiers lay almost as thickly as stood the living. The division divided the ground with
						the dead and wounded. All night the ambulance corps, with their torches of splinters,
						came among the sleeping soldiers, hunting and carrying out those to whom surgical
						attention would be a benefit.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 17th, the brigade was ordered to remain to bury the dead and care
						for the wounded and prisoners. Details were made for the work. Negroes were employed in
						digging trenches for graves. Wagons scoured the field for arms and ammunition, and a
						large detail with negroes, under the medical officers, cut trees and built bowers for
						the wounded. In the Forty-sixth, each company sent out men to gather and bury their own
						dead. They were brought to one place and buried in one grave. "Three who died in the
						hospital were buried there, and one who <pb id="VAB9258-063" n="63"/> was not found was
						afterward buried by the general detail. One other, at the request of his friends, was
						buried alone. This was done on Sunday. On Monday the rebels were buried. They were put
						in trenches, in lots of twenties, thirties and upward, as was most convenient.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-064" n="64"/>

					<p>Of the above wounded, Butler, Stiver, Newell, Glasford, Button, Shein and Lieutenant
						Andrews died in a few days. The Forty-sixth took 350 men into the action.</p>
					<p>The effective strength of the division, at the commencement of the fight, was 4,180. Of
						this number, 211 were killed, 872 wounded and 119 missing, a total of 1,202--28.7 per
						cent. The total Federal loss was 2,408.</p>
					<p>On the 19th the First Brigade started for Vicksburg. The Second had gone forward on the
						day after the battle, but the First overtook it at Black river bridge, where it
						remained, while the First kept on toward the city, which was reached at noon on the
						21st. Five thousand prisoners accompanied the brigade to Black river bridge, where they
						turned off for a point on the Mississippi, above Vicksburg. Arriving at the
						fortifications, the men indulged in a rest. At dark an order came directing an assault
						the next morning. The attack was to be general along the whole line. In the morning the
						camps were astir with preparation. Before the appointed hour the army was in its several
						positions. Ours fell before three forts, on a ridge, backed by a hill. The brigade was
						posted behind Osterhaus' division, and as a support to it. On the signal, the whole
						line, enveloped in fire and smoke, rushed forward. One of Osterhaus' brigades started
						toward the ridge, and our First Brigade closed up to follow, but before Osterhaus made
						half the distance the pits, hills, ravines and breastworks before us were filled with
						men who opened such a fire on the advancing columns that they were broken and scattered.
						At the same time two brass twelve-pound guns opened with grape and completed Osterhaus'
						defeat. The first regiment of Osterhaus', the Seventh Kentucky, was literally swept
						away. The Twenty-fourth and Forty-sixth then took the position in front. A heavy fire
						was kept up all the afternoon, but no more assaults were made.</p>
					<p>It was upon this event that General McClernand reported a successful <hi rend="i"
							>entre</hi> within the rebel works, and upon which he based his famous congratulatory
						order to his corps; but there was no success.</p>
					<p>On June 2, Colonel Kilby Smith, of Ohio; Colonel McMahon, of Wisconsin, and Colonel
						Bringhurst, were detailed by General Grant to go to Milliken's Bend and investigate
						complaints made against the commandant of a negro recruiting camp at that point. While
						there they witnessed a desperate battle between a rebel force of 2,000 and 1,500 negro
						recruits. The battle lasted an hour <pb id="VAB9258-065" n="65"/> only. The rebels had
						250 killed and wounded, the negroes 100 killed and 200 wounded. The Twenty-third Iowa,
						sent up from Young's Point the night before, rendered no assistance in the fight.</p>
					<p>There was not much change in the routine of duty during the siege. The Forty-sixth was
						early assigned a position opposite the fort, where the fatal charge was made on the 22d.
						Two companies were furnished daily for duty on the works, where each man disposed of
						forty rounds. The lines were about 600 yards apart. The works were an embankment with
						sandbags on top, with intervals between for portholes, and a heavy log on the top. The
						men on duty spent the time behind the breastworks, occasionally venturing a look to
						catch some careless rebel, or to be caught themselves.</p>
					<p>Directly in the rear of the regiment was a battery of four guns. Two of them were the
						ones that the regiment brought from New Madrid to Riddle's Point. The other two were
						those the regiment captured at Fulton, below Fort Pillow. These, with some smaller guns,
						were fired directly over the heads of the men. The firing was incessant. At all hours of
						the day and night some of the batteries were at work, and the noise became so familiar
						that it was scarcely noticed. On the 2d of June, under orders, a general cannonading
						from the batteries upon the rebels commenced at 4 o'clock in the morning. Two hundred
						guns were let loose on them. In addition, the gunboats and mortars mixed in. For six
						hours the storm continued. The rifle pits were filled with men, but with no expectation
						of making an assault. The rebels naturally expected an attack, and many of them, curious
						to see what was coming, lost their lives.</p>
					<p>Frisby Richardson, of Company K; Isaac Rinier and Patrick Calahan, of Company F, and
						Soloman M. Camblin, of Company G, were wounded on the works, and Andrew J. Bachelor, of
						Company B, was killed by the falling of a magazine.</p>
					<p>On the 25th orders were received to prepare for the blowing up of a fort on the right
						of the brigade, opposite Logan's division. Everybody was in the works in time. At 4
						o'clock a large fort went up in a cloud of smoke and dust. At the same moment, the
						artillery on the whole line opened on the opposite works, and, where opportunity
						offered, the infantry picked off careless rebels. A desperate fight took place where the
						fort was blown, which lasted until night. On the 28th the rebels attempted to mine <pb
							id="VAB9258-066" n="66"/> under trenches near the regiment's line, but the calculation
						was erroneous and no damage was done.</p>
					<p>About the 20th of June an approach to the rebel lines was begun from Hovey's division.
						A large amount of labor was spent upon it, and its success was only prevented by the
						surrender. During the progress of that work the rebels and Federals frequently met on
						the picket line and had a quiet talk.</p>
					<p>On July 3, about 10 o'clock, white flags appeared on the rebel works to the left of our
						brigade line. Immediately all the works on both sides were covered with men, and great
						anxiety was manifested to discover what was going on. Shortly the flags were taken down
						and a squad of rebel officers went over to the rebel lines. Rumors came thick and fast,
						but nothing was known until night, when an order came saying that a grand national
						salute would be fired at daylight on the morrow; that if the rebels had surrendered, it
						would be blank cartridges; if they had not, it would be ball and shell. The salute in
						the morning told that the truce was not broken. At 10 o'clock a large white flag on the
						Court-house told the story of the great victory, and a shout from 40,000 throats
						welcomed it.</p>
					<p>In a short time the rebel regiments came out in front of their works, stacked their
						arms and hung up their accoutrements. They then marched back. Then regimental flags went
						up on their parapets. Those of the Eleventh and Forty-sixth graced the "big fort."
						During the morning of the 4th, the regiment drew ten days' rations and 150 rounds of
						ammunition and received orders to march at noon. The liberated rebels flocked around the
						soldiers' quarters and were treated with great liberality. Not less than a hundred were
						fed by the Forty-sixth. After dinner the boys strolled into town. They looked over the
						city, inspected the rebel officers and soldiers and returned to camp.</p>
					<p>At Champion's Hill the regiment found a large number of Springfield rifles, thrown down
						by the rebels. Six companies laid down their Austrians in their place. Now the last
						Austrian was disposed of and a full complement of good guns secured. This irregular
						exchange of arms was the occasion of an immense amount of trouble in the ordinance
						department. For twenty years after the colonel received annual demands for an accounting
						of the Austrian guns.</p>

					<p>Started on July 5 for Joe Johnston, at Jackson. Thermometer 100. Very dusty. Three army
						corps formed the expedition. <pb id="VAB9258-067" n="67"/> They were to march on three
						roads and meet at Bolton, then again separate and meet again at Clinton. Encamped that
						night near Black river, ten miles. This march has been pronounced the most fatiguing and
						distressing ever made by the Forty-sixth. The regiment remained at that point until the
						evening of the next day. The line of march was taken up at 5 o'clock, and the bridge was
						reached. It was so crowded that the regiment was unable to cross, and went into camp. At
						5 o'clock on the morning of the 7th the Forty-sixth was on the road, and reached Bolton,
						eighteen miles, at 6 o'clock. Regiments and batteries crowded in, and by dark the
						confusion was desperate. Soon the rain began. Our division settled down along the road.
						Occasional flashes of lightning disclosed a confused mass of artillery, horses, wagons,
						men, etc. The rain put out the fires, and there was no supper. It became totally dark,
						and for six hours that experience of the regiment was its worst. During the night
						stragglers came in, waking dozing men with inquiries about their regiment. Horses and
						mules, imperfectly tied, stalked among the men, or got up rows with the horses of the
						artillery or the wagons.</p>
					<p>The next morning the sun came out hot, and the moisture was evaporated from the ground
						in clouds. The regiment moved out of the water a short distance, and remained until
						evening.</p>
					<p>At 4 o'clock the regiments moved out to their positions, and made a grand appearance.
						The bands were playing and the men sang patriotic songs. All were in high glee and
						confident that Johnston would soon be driven off. Made three miles by 11 o'clock, and
						laid down. Started again at 8 o'clock, on the 9th, and made Bolton, ten miles, by 11
						o'clock. Skirmishers were used nearly all the way between Bolton and Clinton. At Clinton
						the regiment rested an hour, overtook a number of willing prisoners, and encamped a mile
						beyond Clinton.</p>
					<p>On the 10th the three corps were again together, and it was late before the regiment
						obtained its road. At noon the division was within two miles of Jackson, and went into
						camp. Very heavy skirmishing was going on.</p>
					<p>At noon on the 11th the regiment was assigned its position in the line. Skirmished all
						the afternoon and until dark, when, after crossing the New Orleans railroad, the men
						laid down in line of battle.</p>
					<p>On the 12th of July the Federal lines closed up on the town. Our line was by the two
						brigades, in their order, with the right on <pb id="VAB9258-068" n="68"/> the railroad,
						and the left resting on Benton's division. Lawman's division was on the right of the
						road, and was rapidly moving up. Two companies of each regiment were in advance as
						skirmishers. The Forty-sixth was on the right of the division. The Twenty-fourth and
						Thirty-fourth were in reserve. Lawman was far in advance of the line. He charged on a
						rebel earthwork without being able to bring his artillery into action or protect his
						men. In consequence the rebel fire was concentrated on that division, to the advantage
						of that on the left. Our First Brigade made the advance and got into position without
						difficulty, but after a sharp fight.</p>

					<p>The regiment had none killed in the engagement. The wounded were Jeremiah Johnson, of
						Company G, who died on the 19th; Alfred H. Hardy, who died on the 18th; George G.
						Hamilton, of Company C; John B. Waldron, of Company G; Milton Hancock, Amos Orput and
						Cyrus Peabody, of Company I, and Lieutenant Mitchell, of Company H.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained in line of battle from the 12th to the 21st of July. On the 14th
						a flag of truce went out from our side to procure the burial of the dead. The dead of
						Lawman's division had lain out since the 12th, and their burial became a necessity. For
						the first day and night the complaints of the wounded were constantly heard, but it
						being impossible to relieve them, they had perished. Two men had crawled out to the
						picket line, and were met and helped by members of the Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>The burial party was furnished by the rebels, and they did their work very
						superficially and in a great hurry. A large portion of the dead had been wounded and
						died from want of attention. Some had crawled under trees and bushes. Groups of two and
						three were found huddled behind logs in their effort to shelter themselves from the
						shells and balls that showered over them.</p>
					<p>Three hundred bodies were buried at this one point. Lawman's loss was 475.</p>
					<p>General Lawman was relieved, and ordered to report to General Grant at Vicksburg.</p>
					<p>A roster of the rebel army, found at Vicksburg, showed that there were, at Jackson,
						troops from Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama,
						Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky--seventy-eight infantry regiments, nine of
						cavalry, and sixteen batteries.</p>
					<p>The rebels had a fine band on their line opposite the Forty-sixth. <pb id="VAB9258-069"
							n="69"/> Each night it would play until "tattoo." They would play "Bonnie Blue Flag,"
						"Dixie," etc., calling out cheers from both sides.</p>
					<p>An exciting scene occurred at the Insane asylum when the assault was made at that
						point. The inmates were terribly excited, and were seen at the windows shouting to the
						soldiers. None were hurt, though several balls went through the building.</p>
					<p>Just before daylight on the 21st, a man was brought to the headquarters of the
						Forty-sixth, who said he was just from town, and that the rebels were evacuating. The
						man was sent to the quarters of General Blair, and in a few minutes a division was on
						the march for the city.</p>
					<p>The rebels had, before leaving, set fire to many warehouses. The conflagration spread,
						and in a short time the principal part of the town was in flames. Across Pearl river the
						rebels had buried torpedoes. Only four of them exploded. A horse, drawing a cart
						containing a man, two women and two children, struck a torpedo with his foot and
						exploded it. The horse, cart and people were distributed over the road. Rebels, with
						shovels and picks, were put to work digging out the dangerous missiles.</p>
					<p>On the 21st the army was employed on the railroads. The rails were torn up and twisted
						around trees and telegraph poles, and the ties were piled and burned.</p>
					<p>On the same day the division started back toward Vicksburg. The regiment reached
						Raymond at 5 o'clock. The men were very much fatigued. Many did not reach camp until
						late at night. On the 22d the march was to Black river, with half the regiment behind.
						On the next day, the regiment started for Vicksburg, ten miles distant, and reached
						there about noon.</p>
					<p>This hard march was without necessity. The columns were pushed through at a rate far
						beyond the ability of the men, and against positive orders. Five miles west of Bolton
						the regiment was deluged with rain, and witnessed the killing of two Wisconsin men by
						lightning.</p>
					<p>On reaching the river, the regiment went into camp just below the city. A number of
						commissions were found awaiting several officers and men of the Forty-sixth, but as the
						regiment had been reduced below the minimum, many of those promoted could not be
						mustered. This situation was unfortunate. Many of the men promoted had rendered
						excellent service, and deserved their commissions, but the order was inexorable and
						could not be evaded.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-070" n="70"/>
					<p>Furloughs were given the men at the rate of one in twenty. Many officers resigned.</p>
					<p>The sick list was small. The men had become inured to exposure and hardship, and were
						able for anything. Many of the wounded rejoined, among them Adjutant Watts, whose
						recovery seemed a miracle.</p>
					<p>The Union loss in killed and wounded in the Vicksburg campaign, exclusive of the last
						Jackson expedition, was 8,807. The rebel loss in the same time was 56,000 men killed,
						wounded and prisoners, 260 cannon, 60,000 small arms and immense stores.</p>
					<p>Under orders, the regiment shipped on board the "Baltic," on the 4th of August, with
						the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, for Natchez.</p>

					<p>A<hi rend="sc">UGUST</hi> 22, 1863, First Lieutenant John T. Castle, of Company B,
						resigned; Corporal Theodore P. Forgey was commissioned in his place.</p>
					<p>The "Baltic" was one of the Marine Brigade boats, a transport fitted up for general
						purposes. It was amphibious, intended for operations on both land and water. It had
						artillery on wheels and with horses. It was heavily barricaded against rifle balls. This
						boat was not able to hold two regiments, but the orders were to put them on, and it had
						to be done. The Forty-sixth was on by 10 o'clock. The Twenty-ninth was hardly on by
						daylight. All of the Forty-sixth's property was on except the wagons. With six other
						boats, the "Baltic" started at 6 o'clock. At 4 o'clock <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> the
						fleet was at Natchez, and at 7 o'clock the regiment was on its camp ground, waiting for
						the wagons. Two were finally borrowed and a portion of the property brought up. In the
						morning the remainder came. By the 7th of August, the regiment was comfortably fixed in
						good quarters.</p>
					<p>Up to the 15th, the regiment remained enjoying a well earned rest, when orders came for
						a removal. At 5 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> of that date, three wagons were borrowed, and
						the regiment, with the Eleventh Indiana, loaded on the "Des Arc." By 8 o'clock
						everything was on board except the men of the Forty-sixth. The boat being crowded, it
						was thought pleasanter on the ground. A three hours' rain in the night discounted the
						conclusion considerably. Just at daylight the regiment marched through town and onto the
						boat. The "Des Arc" was found to be the successor of the "Golden State," the boat on
						which some of our companies came down the <pb id="VAB9258-072" n="72"/> Ohio in 1862.
						Some of the same officers were on the new boat, and they were much pleased to meet the
						Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>The boat stopped a short time at Port Hudson, and rounded to five miles above New
						Orleans at 8 o'clock, on the 17th of August.</p>
					<p>Up to the 12th of September, the regiment enjoyed a good rest. Occasional rumors of
						sundry expeditions excited their apprehensions, but nothing serious until, on the 12th,
						an order for a march came. The regiment was at its very best. The men had good clothes,
						and an abundance of camp equipage, and were in good health. The order to move was not
						really unwelcome, for the boys were anxious to see what else the Confederacy had.</p>
					<p>On the 22d and 29th of August, and on the 4th of September, grand reviews were held by
						Generals Grant and Banks. There was a splendid display, and the regiment received as
						much attention as any. In the line were forty regiments of infantry, a thousand
						cavalrymen and eighty pieces of artillery. On the 4th of September, General Grant, while
						riding at high speed, ran into a carriage, was thrown from his horse and severely
						injured.</p>
					<p>The regiment left Carrollton with the Twenty-fourth and the right wing of the Eleventh,
						on the "Meteor." In an hour they were landed at Algiers, opposite New Orleans, and at
						the eastern terminus of the New Orleans and Opelonsas railroad. The regiment laid down
						along the track, and at midnight, with the Twenty-fourth, boarded a train of fifteen
						flat cars for Brashear City. The cars were already loaded with pork and crackers, and
						the men had to accommodate themselves on the barrels and boxes. The train started with
						the loudest yells the men could give. The Algerines were alarmed, and their terror was
						not decreased on learning that more western men were passing through their town.</p>

					<p>Brashear City was reached at 6 o'clock. The sun was intensely hot. The men sought
						shelter under anything that offered a shade, and the early part of the day was spent in
						trying to keep cool.</p>
					<p>A new battle flag was received from Governor Morton while the regiment was at
						Brashear.</p>
					<p>At Carrollton, orders were issued cutting baggage down to the smallest possible
						quantity. The order said: "Personal baggage will be reduced to a valise or carpet bag
						and a roll of blankets for each officer. No cots or bedsteads will be taken, or tables
						or chairs. A mess chest of 100 pounds will be allowed to each mess of three to five
						officers, and 250 pounds to from six to ten officers. Rubber blankets will be issued to
						the men."</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-073" n="73"/>

					<p>Being without tents, the men built shelters out of the scant material at hand. A number
						of wagons and guns had been destroyed by the rebels, when they recaptured the place some
						time before. The remaining material was collected, and, with the blankets and ponchoes,
						passable shelters were constructed.</p>
					<p>A colored regiment, numbering a thousand, belonging to the Nineteenth Corps, was at
						Brashear. The men were stout and hearty, and spoke French.</p>
					<p>Previous to the recent advent of troops, the place had been occupied by eastern
						regiments--"Nutmegs," the residents called them. When the Twenty-first Indiana
						(artillery) came, its men were the first "Hoosiers" that had been seen, and the people,
						taken with their manners, so different from the "Nutmegs," transferred their regards to
						the former. This was especially the case with the ladies, a few of whom resided at
						Berwick. When the Third Brigade arrived, another element was felt at Berwick. The "New
						Hoosiers" were different from the others. They were excessively familiar and sociable.
						The chief establishment in town was the "hotel," where some of the officers of the other
						regiments boarded. Attached to the hotel was a "bar," but the sale of liquors to
						soldiers had been forbidden by the provost marshal. Some sales were made, however, on
						the sly. The lady proprietor obeyed the order as against the "New Hoosiers," which
						naturally irritated those gentlemen. Retaliation was determined upon. Late one night a
						party came in front of the gallery and serenaded the ladies. They sang the new war
						songs, and delighted the audience. In the meantime, another squad had gone into the
						bar-room and rolled out several barrels of beer and other luxuries. The proprietress,
						suspecting a flank movement, went into the house and discovered the depredation. She
						became frantic, and was taken in charge by a friendly regimental surgeon, who did his
						best to pacify the irate lady. The good doctor turned upon the men and severely
						denounced their conduct. He gave them a terrible lecture. The men listened with the most
						respectful attention, and the young ladies gave the doctor the most profuse thanks for
						his gallant interference. The despoiled proprietress believed in the reformatory
						influences of the doctor's service, and was regarding him as her best friend, when a
						young darkey ran up and announced that the "New Hoosiers" were again in the bar-room.
						While a portion of the men were deluding the doctor and the ladies with a penitential
						hearing of his lecture, another squad had utterly sacked the <pb id="VAB9258-074" n="74"
						/> premises. The doctor did not take breakfast at the hotel the next morning, as he was
						regarded as an accomplice in the depredation. The entire division crossed the bayou the
						28th of September and took up temporary quarters in the town of Berwick. The first
						experience of the regiment there was a dismal rain of three days' duration. The ground
						was inundated. Messes that had built up shelters were compelled to roost upon them to
						keep dry. The sun appeared the third day, and, with the wind, gave the place a different
						look.</p>
					<p>Orders came to march on the 4th, and were received by the men with acclamation. Other
						orders changed the date to the 3d, on which day, at 7 o'clock, the regiment was on the
						road. Each regiment had four wagons, in which were carried cooking utensils, provisions
						and ammunition. No tents were to be seen. The provisions were hard bread, coffee and
						salt. The other articles were to be "procured."</p>
					<p>The regiment reached Centreville, sixteen miles, the first day. On the next, Franklin
						was made--twelve miles. The boys approved of Franklin and would liked to have stayed
						there, and the people fancied the "Hoosiers."</p>
					<p>On the 5th of October the regiment marched twelve miles and went into camp on a large
						plantation owned by a Frenchman. An extensive sugar mill, with all the appliances for
						raising cane and making sugar, were part of the institution. For some reason great care
						was taken of this property. Orders were issued forbidding the burning of rails, killing
						of sheep or cattle, or the commission of any of the usual excesses often indulged in by
						the soldiers.</p>
					<p>During the day orders were sent to all the colonels to place a guard in front of the
						regiments at the halt in the evening, to prevent the burning of rails, etc. This was
						considered, by the soldiers, a great invasion of their franchise. Great dissatisfaction
						was expressed. Just before the halt, the colonel of the Forty-sixth had a conference
						with the captains, when it was arranged that the men should be informed that the guard
						would not be called for if the rails and other property on the regiment's front were not
						disturbed, and the officers obtained from the men promises accordingly.</p>
					<p>At the halt, the brigade stacked arms in line. In all the regiments, the "orderly's
						call" was heard, and the regiments prepared the required guard. In the meantime, the
						Forty-sixth people were skirmishing for wood and provisions, and by the time <pb
							id="VAB9258-075" n="75"/> the guards of the other regiments were out there was nothing
						to be protected.</p>
					<p>It was not long before the general's orderly came in and notified all the colonels that
						their presence was desired at headquarters, and those officers met and repaired to the
						general's quarters. On the road much speculation was indulged in as to the purpose of
						the call. None could guess. But Colonel McCauley, of the Eleventh, pointing to the
						brigade line, suggested that the absence of fences on the line had something to do with
						the business.</p>
					<p>General McGinnis was found pacing before his tent in an irate condition. He was as
						straight as a tent pole, and held his head in the position of a very angry soldier. The
						officers approached and respectfully saluted. The general said: "Gentlemen, did you
						happen to get an order this morning requiring the posting of guards on the halt, this
						evening?" and all responded: "We did, sir." Then said the general: "How was the order
						obeyed? Look at the brigade front. The fences are all gone." The colonel of the
						Forty-sixth modestly referred the general to the fence on the front of his regiment, and
						suggested that he be excepted from the general censure. Looking over and shading his
						eyes with his hand, the general said: "Yes, the Forty-sixth has obeyed the order. It is
						the only regiment that has done so. It has its fences intact." Some very pointed remarks
						were then made to the delinquent colonels on the general subject of obedience to orders,
						and the officers were sent back to their regiments. Those disobedient officers always,
						afterward, insisted that while they were detailing guards, as ordered, the Forty-sixth
						people carried off all the rails on their fronts, and left them without fences to guard
						and subject to censure for the work of the Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>The regiment was called on that night for "a good, honest company" to guard a large
						flock of sheep that was on the premises. Company I was detailed. It was afterward
						charged, by envious persons in other regiments, that seventeen head of fat sheep were
						carried into the Forty-sixth's camp in the night--so jealous were some of the good
						reputation of an honest company. The proprietor manifested his gratitude for the care
						taken of his property by presenting the field officers, the next morning, with a fine
						dressed sheep for consumption during the day's march.</p>
					<p>Somebody brought a goose into the field quarters the same night, and as there was a
						superabundance of meat already on hand <pb id="VAB9258-076" n="76"/> it was artistically
						cooked, and, with a polite note, sent to General McGinnis as a fruit of obedience to
						orders; the goose, as alleged, having been caught in the fence preserved under general
						orders. On the march the next day General McGinnis was unusually sedate, but his staff
						officers that evening confessed that the goose was good, and much enjoyed even by the
						General.</p>
					<p>On the evening of the 5th the brigade overtook the Nineteenth Corps and camped three
						miles from New Iberia.</p>
					<p>The First Division of the Thirteenth Corps passed Iberia on the 6th. The Fourth came up
						and encamped near Iberia on the same day. On the morning of the 10th the Fourth Division
						was on the road westward. No regiment in the division had drawn rations for several
						days, and none were in a condition to march. The last day's march of the Forty-sixth
						covered twenty-four miles, nineteen of which were without water. Camp was reached after
						dark, and the men as they came in were loaded with chickens and potatoes gathered along
						the road.</p>
					<p>When daylight came, on the 11th, the men were astonished and enchanted with the scene
						before them. They looked over a broad prairie, covered with a luxuriant crop of tall
						grass, "just the thing for beds." Innumerable cattle were grazing, unconscious of the
						arrival of the Hoosiers. The plain was fringed with timber and cultivated plantations.
						The crack of a hundred rifles raised the impression that a skirmish was on, but it was
						only a skirmish for steaks for breakfast.</p>
					<p>On the 12th the brigade camped for a short stay. A school for field officers and
						brigade drills was instituted.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 15th firing was heard in front. Again, at noon, artillery was
						heard, and at 1 o'clock orders came for an advance. At 3 o'clock the First Brigade took
						the road and marched until midnight, nineteen miles. An attack had been made on General
						Weitzell, but he had driven the rebels off.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 16th the brigade moved a mile forward and encamped on a fine
						prairie. The brigade had just broken ranks when a disturbance occurred in front. Cavalry
						came dashing over the plain. Rebel cannon in the timber were firing. The brigade line
						moved forward, and the cannon opened on the enemy. The artillery and cavalry moved up
						and found the rebels trying to get a large drove of cattle out of the woods. After a
						brief fight, the rebels retreated with a few of the cattle, leaving the most of them for
						us.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-077" n="77"/>

					<p>On the 17th the regiment received orders to encamp near the quarters of General
						Franklin, and to do picket duty. In an hour the regiment was in its new quarters.
						Pickets were furnished toward Opelousas and Grand Choteau.</p>
					<p>A reconnoissance was made on the 19th by a cavalry force supported by the Thirty-fourth
						Indiana. They went eight miles and found the rebels, skirmished and drove them.</p>
					<p>On the 20th the Nineteenth Corps marched, with our First Brigade in advance. Some
						cavalry had gone before. The remainder of the Third Division was in reserve. The negro
						regiment of engineers was on the right of the brigade, and marched in perfect order,
						singing "John Brown." Two hundred and fifty of these men carried arms, the remainder
						cleared away obstructions.</p>
					<p>The rebels were posted in a wood, and there was enough of them to make a good fight,
						but they fled. General Franklin rode behind the regiment on the advance, and
						complimented the men for their precise movements. In the presence of the commander it is
						to be supposed the regiment showed off some. The brigade went through Opelousas and
						turned off to Barre's landing, where it arrived the same evening.</p>
					<p>Barre's landing is on the Bayou Cortableaux. The diversion was made here in the hope of
						getting supplies by the bayou, but as that was found impracticable, the brigade rejoined
						the column on the 29th.</p>
					<p>On the return of the expedition from Opelousas, the First Division, under General
						Burbridge, was left at the camp formerly occupied by the First and Third Divisions,
						eight miles from that town. The Third Division camped about three miles east of that
						camp. Between the two divisions there was a plain, or prairie, three miles wide, bounded
						on the right by timber. The First was on Carancro bayou.</p>
					<p>On the 2d of November, Burbridge was attacked by a rebel force, which he defeated, but
						our division was marched nearly to the scene of action. On the same day, our forage
						trains were driven in. At a house in sight of the camp a captain of the Twenty-eighth
						Iowa was killed. Three men of the same regiment and two of the Thirty-fourth were killed
						in the same neighborhood. The captain was in charge of a small guard, and seeing a squad
						of Federals, as he supposed, ahead, rode up and saluted them. They were dressed in blue.
						They surrounded and shot him, and robbed. him even of his clothes.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-078" n="78"/>

					<p>On the 3d, after a few cannon shots, a courier rode in and reported that the rebels
						were making another attack, and it was apprehended that a general engagement would
						result. The division was called in line, but another courier reporting that Burbridge
						had driven the rebels back again, the men were dismissed.</p>
					<p>The First Brigade was encamped in line of battle on the right of the road, the
						Twenty-fourth on the right and the Forty-sixth on the left. So decisive were the
						indications of a battle, that the colonel had the men stack arms in line and cook and
						remain close to the guns. The men had an early dinner and it was quickly eaten.</p>
					<p>At noon sharp firing was heard in front. An aide of General Washburn's was seen riding
						rapidly toward the brigade, bare-headed and waving his hat. The Forty-sixth was
						instantly ordered in line, and, in a few minutes, was marching by column up the road.
						Going a short distance, the regiment was overtaken by an aide of General Cameron, who
						ordered the colonel to halt and await the passing of the brigade and resume his proper
						position in the column. The colonel respectfully said that he would go on a short
						distance and await the brigade, and give the men the benefit of the rest.</p>
					<p>The regiment marched on rapidly for two miles, when men, wagon trains and artillery
						were seen dashing out of the woods. Rebel cavalrymen were seen striking teamsters and
						artillerymen with their sabers. A mule team dashed through and over all opposition.
						Batteries of artillery rushed from the woods. Many of them were overtaken by the rebels
						and the men killed.</p>
					<p>Of the artillery, two guns of the Second Massachusetts Battery made straight for the
						regiment, followed closely by the rebel cavalry. By this time the regiment was within
						shot. The line was formed, and the men laid on the ground and went to work. The two
						Massachusetts guns reached the regiment's right, and the gunners felt satisfied to be
						safe. They declined firing because they had no water, but they discovered that fire was
						more necessary to their safety than water. Both soon got into action, and did good
						service. The rapid firing of the regiment and the two guns checked the rebels and drove
						them to the woods. Shortly after this, the remainder of the brigade arrived. It was
						ordered to await the arrival of the Second Brigade before pursuing the rebels. This was
						the mistake, for when the Second came the rebels were on the road to Opelousas. At the
						close of the action, <pb id="VAB9258-079" n="79"/> Generals Washburn and Cameron rode up
						to the regiment and thanked the men for their prompt and timely service, and
						complimented them on their general efficiency. The regiment had none killed in this
						engagement. The wounded were: John J. Viney, of Company A; James Luzader, of Company G,
						and John Howell, of Company F.</p>
					<p>Burbridge's loss was eighteen killed and 100 wounded. Four hundred prisoners were
						taken. An entire regiment in Burbridge's division was captured.</p>
					<p>The rebels had over 100 killed. Twenty dead and twelve wounded were found in the woods
						opposite the position of the Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>During the fight the rebel cavalry moved around on the flanks and attacked the camps,
						but were driven off.</p>
					<p>The camp property of Burbridge's division was all destroyed.</p>
					<p>On the day after the fight General Burbridge personally thanked the Forty-sixth for its
						timely assistance.</p>
					<p>On the night of the battle the entire army came back to the camp previously occupied by
						the Third Division, and on the morning of the 6th all were on the road toward Berwick. A
						rebel force of 8,000 kept close to us. The column was long. The Nineteenth Corps was in
						front. The last of our division crossed and burned the bridge at 9 o'clock, and was
						fired on by the rebels.</p>
					<p>After a march of five miles the rebels made another attack, and compelled us to halt
						and form line of battle, but the enemy kept off.</p>
					<p>On the night of the 5th, the entire camp was aroused by the explosion of a shell in the
						quarters of the Forty-sixth regiment. Charles Baum, of Company E, taking advantage of a
						lull in business, undertook the boiling of a piece of beef to enable him to keep up on
						the march the next day. He had propped up his camp kettle with a shell that he had found
						near the fire. The shell had not been exploded, and about 10 o'clock, as Baum was on his
						knees, blowing the coals, the fuse became ignited and the shell went off. The kettle and
						the beef also went off. Baum was rolled over several times, but received no injury
						except having his eyes filled with dirt. As a large force of the enemy was close, an
						attack was expected, and the general officers, with their aides, were dashing about in
						search of the cause of the alarm. Baum was in search of his beef, but in neither case
						was the search successful.</p>
					<p>The head of the column reached Vermillionville about 10 <pb id="VAB9258-080" n="80"/>
						o'clock. It passed on through town and encamped three miles beyond. An infantry guard of
						twenty-five was left in town to guard some hospital stores. The Forty-sixth was stopped
						and directed to remain on the edge of town until the property in it was removed. It
						rained in torrents. The regiment made the best quarters possible, and watched for the
						rebels. A train of wagons, containing some forty bales of cotton, was levied on and held
						for defensive purposes. In the afternoon the sun came out, and the place had a better
						look. The night was passed without disturbance, though it was certain that there were
						10,000 rebels within three miles, preparing to take the regiment in.</p>
					<p>Fires were made from fences, and the men made themselves comfortable for the night. At
						daylight earnest preparations were begun to add to the general security of the position.
						There was a bright, warm sun, and blankets and clothing were dried. There was nothing on
						the flanks. The picket was one of the companies and twenty-five cavalrymen. The
						territory thus protected was small, and the regiment was kept together and constantly
						under arms.</p>
					<p>Toward noon the real character of the position became manifest. From the steeple of the
						church the rebels were in full view. They were seen arriving and settling down in
						temporary quarters, while complete and compact lines were visible for over a mile across
						the regiment's front. Residents were coming in, reporting the situation outside, and
						always in the highest colors. These were sent back to General Franklin. Two hundred
						yards in front of the regiment, in a cottage, was seen posted a squad of rebel scouts,
						observing the Federal position. On being discovered, it was driven off. This created
						great excitement in town. There was a general packing up, and a desire to get out. The
						position of the people between the two armies was not encouraging.</p>
					<p>At 5 o'clock the sight from the steeple was grand. The prairie in front presented an
						area of many miles. Within three miles the rebels were visible without the glass, and
						with the glass far beyond that distance. All were evidently ready for business. Three
						miles to the rear, the Federal army was in sight. The two army corps had been in line
						most of the day. Now, at sunset, the clearest hour of the day, the heavy, dark lines of
						infantry, each regiment distinguished by its flag, was distinctly seen, while the heavy
						batteries, with their bright guns in line, and the squadrons of cavalry moving about,
						added life and meaning to the scene.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-081" n="81"/>

					<p>Midway between these great points of interest, and watched closely by both, was a line
						of 300 men, quietly awaiting the approach of the rebels, or of night, when they might
						prepare defenses, without being seen by the spies near by.</p>
					<p>As soon as it was dark, the cotton bales were rolled into position and active spades
						completed an ample protection by 10 o'clock.</p>
					<p>The defense being finished, the regiment was marched in and each man's place assigned
						him, when the regiment went back to its former position, to remain until 3 o'clock, when
						they were to get behind the cotton to surprise the rebels, who would, naturally, attack
						the original position.</p>
					<p>At 1 o'clock the regiment was called in. As it marched through town, the rebel cavalry
						followed and remained until daylight, when the Federal cavalry drove them out.</p>
					<p>The cotton taken for defenses by the regiment was, in 1880, claimed by a Frenchman
						pretending to be loyal. He sued for its value in the Federal Court of Claims, and
						recovered $10,000.</p>
					<p>Lewis Messner, of Company K, and John Clingin, of Company G, were captured, two miles
						from Vermillionville, on the 12th of November. They were exchanged about January 8.</p>
					<p>The regiment took its place in the brigade line at Vermillionville bayou, near
						daylight, on the 8th of November, where the army remained, occasionally skirmishing with
						the rebels, until the morning of the 16th, when it quietly packed up and moved off. The
						pickets were kept out until the last moment, and New Iberia was reached without any
						interference from the rebels. Lake Mauripas is six miles from Iberia. The division
						encamped there the first day, and leisurely marched to Iberia the next. Here the rebels
						made their appearance. As the division reached camp, two wagons of the Forty-sixth, out
						for forage, with five men, were captured. Shortly afterward a large force appeared and
						were driven off with shells.</p>
					<p>On the 19th the regiment went across the Teche as an escort to a forage train. Saw
						rebels at a distance.</p>
					<p>At midnight of the 19th had orders to fall in at 3 o'clock, with eighty rounds and no
						baggage. The regiment was in line promptly, and, with the brigade and a squadron of
						cavalry, started for a rebel force, said to be at Camp Pratt, near Lake Mauripas. Just
						before daylight the advance ran upon the picket, captured it. and surrounded the
						camp.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-082" n="82"/>

					<p>The rebels were caught asleep, and the entire force, except two men, captured. The
						commandant, a major, was one of the unlucky ones. Two rebels were killed and twelve
						wounded. One hundred men, and twelve commissioned officers, were mounted on mules and
						taken to camp. Two or three of the smaller men were assigned to one mule. The brigade,
						with the prisoners and two bands of music, passed through the camp of the division, and
						was greeted with hearty shouts.</p>
					<p>Thanksgiving Day was duly observed in camp by the Third Division. A platform was built
						in front of headquarters, and the ten regiments, with visitors from other divisions,
						assembled in the morning and had a sermon, prayers, music by two bands and singing of
						religious and patriotic songs by the congregation. Then there were speeches by men and
						officers. On this occasion every soldier held his gun, and all were ready to repel an
						assault that was constantly possible. In the afternoon a grand horse race came off. The
						same ceremonies common on such occasions at home were observed. On both occasions of the
						day the rebels were visible, watching, at a safe distance, the doings of the division.
						At the Thanksgiving meeting the "Veteran" subject was largely discussed and favorably
						considered.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained at New Iberia until the 19th of December, when the line of march
						was taken up for Brashear City. As the brigade passed the quarters of General Franklin,
						the boys gave him three rousing cheers, and when they came to the camp of the Nineteenth
						Corps the "Nutmegs" were given a parting yell, such as they so heartily despised.</p>
					<p>At Berwick the division occupied the ground formerly held by the Fourth.</p>
					<p>On the 22d the First Brigade was ferried over the bay to Brashear, and the
						Twenty-fourth and Eleventh went on the cars to Algiers. The Forty-sixth and a battalion
						of the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin went on the train at noon, on the 22d, in a heavy rain,
						and reached Algiers at 8 o'clock in the evening, when the men found dry spots along the
						railroad and slept. The "Veteran" subject again came up, and was warmly discussed.</p>
					<p>On the 29th of December, Companies C, F, H and I shipped on a steamer for Texas. Landed
						at Matagorda bay, where they met the Seventy-seventh Illinois and the Thirteenth and
						Fifteenth Maine. Remained two weeks, when they returned to Madisonville.</p>
					<p>On the 19th of January the Eleventh and Forty-sixth were <pb id="VAB9258-083" n="83"/>
						ferried to the Lake Pontchartrain railroad, by which they were transported to the lake,
						where they embarked on a steamer for Madisonville, where they arrived at 9 o'clock and
						went into camp.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained at Madisonville until the 27th of February. Its history there was
						uneventful. There was no enemy in the vicinity, and but little duty to perform.
						Considerable work was done on earthworks, but not more than enough for exercise.</p>
					<p>Leaving Madisonville, the regiment went back to Algiers. Here the "Veteran" movement
						was perfected. Three hundred and seven men re-enlisted, dating January 2, 1864. The
						non-veterans were assigned to the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, and, subsequently, to Varner's
						Battalion.</p>
					<p>Orders were received to prepare for a march west on the 3d of March. They were received
						with great dissatisfaction by all. It was expected that the regiment would remain at
						Algiers until the promised furlough could be had. The Eleventh, Twenty-fourth,
						Thirty-fourth and Forty-seventh had gone home, and the boys felt dissatisfied in being
						obliged to give up their anticipated pleasure and enter upon a protracted and dangerous
						service. Like good soldiers, however, they obeyed the order.</p>
					<p>Of the Thirteenth Corps, the Third and Fourth Divisions only went. The others were in
						Texas. Of the Third Division, the four regiments before mentioned were absent. The corps
						was commanded by General Ransom. The Nineteenth Corps was complete and commanded by
						General Franklin. This portion of the expedition started from Algiers, another from
						Vicksburg. A fleet of gunboats and monitors went up Red river. The army was commanded by
						General Banks, the navy under Commodore Porter.</p>

					<p>On leaving Algiers, all superfluous and considerable necessary baggage was left. The
						regiment traveled lighter than ever before. The men had no tents, and were expected to
						make shelter with their ponchoes and blankets. It was not many days before even those
						articles were thrown away.</p>
					<p>On the march toward Alexandria the route laid over the same road already twice traveled
						by the Forty-sixth. This march was enlivened by frequent attacks by the rebels, and the
						knowledge that a serious battle would be fought.</p>
					<p>At many points on the road where it was supposed it might occur, the promised "veteran
						furlough" was looked for. At Natchitoches hope fled, and the subject was dropped.</p>
					<p>On the night of the 7th of April, 1864, the Thirteenth and Nineteenth Corps encamped at
						Pleasant Hill, nineteen miles from Mansfield, or Sabine Cross Roads. The cavalry near
						this point overtook the rebel rear guard, under General Green, and after a brief
						skirmish drove the rebels forward, killing thirty and wounding sixty men, General Lee's
						loss being twenty killed and fifty wounded. The cavalry then moved on about six miles,
						and went into camp. The infantry force mentioned was well concentrated and in high
						spirits. The baggage and supply trains were well up, and the artillery was conveniently
						parked. Long lines of camp fires gleamed brightly through the thick pine forest. Groups
						of dusty men with high hopes sang patriotic songs around blazing pine faggots, while
						others reposed on the soft carpet of leaves, <pb id="VAB9258-087" n="87"/> dreaming of
						home and those who were there watching for their return, little thinking that the next
						night would find them hurrying to the same spot, broken and scattered, with many lying
						stiff in death, or, with mangled limbs, in the hands of a heartless and exasperated foe.
						A happy, joyous night was soon to be turned to a day of mourning.</p>
					<p>On the 8th, the sun rose bright in a cloudless sky, ushering in a beautiful but to the
						Union army a disastrous day. At 5 o'clock, the Fourth Division of the Thirteenth Army
						Corps, commanded by Colonel Landrum, of the Nineteenth Kentucky, moved forward to
						support the cavalry. At 6 o'clock the Third Division, under General R. A. Cameron,
						numbering, exclusive of train guards, about 1,200 men, followed. After this force came
						the supply trains of the Thirteenth Corps.</p>
					<p>At 7 o'clock, General Emory, with one division of the Nineteenth Corps, followed by the
						remaining trains of the army, moved out. The remainder of the Nineteenth Corps, which
						was the bulk of the army present, followed under Major General Franklin. The train
						numbered over 600 wagons, of which those of the general's staff formed no inconsiderable
						portion.</p>
					<p>The road over which this enormous train was to pass was a narrow, tortuous passage,
						through a dense pine forest--so narrow in many places that a single horseman could
						scarcely pass the moving wagons. The rear guard of the army did not get away until after
						12 o'clock. At this time the Sixteenth Corps, under General A. J. Smith, was on the road
						from Grand Ecore, where it had disembarked from boats.</p>
					<p>About 7 o'clock the cavalry discovered the enemy, about 5,000 strong, posted on a deep
						bayou, eight miles from Pleasant Hill--a position chosen for the advantage which it
						gave to them. A brisk skirmish ensued--on our side principally with carbines, our
						cavalry being dismounted. The Fourth Division was hurried forward and the enemy soon
						dislodged and driven back. The contest here was brief but fierce. The enemy fell back
						slowly, stubbornly contesting the ground, closely pursued by the cavalry and the small
						body of infantry. A running fight was kept up for a distance of eight miles, when, at 2
						o'clock, the enemy, after passing a plantation of 600 acres, made a determined stand. A
						council of war was now held, at which were General Banks and all the general officers.
						It was proposed to go into camp, issue rations and give the Sixteenth and Nineteenth
						Corps time to get up, and <pb id="VAB9258-088" n="88"/> be prepared on the next morning
						to fight the battle that now appeared inevitable. This wise proposition was overruled,
						and General Lee was ordered to push the enemy. It was argued that the enemy was not in
						force in front, that it was nothing but the force that had been opposing the expedition
						the day or two previous, and that the cavalry, supported by the infantry then up, was
						sufficient for the work.</p>
					<p>During this halt the Third Division had moved up to within four miles of the scene of
						action. While the consultation was going on, it was ordered to go into camp. It remained
						at this point about two hours, when General Cameron received orders to move at once to
						the front.</p>
					<p>By this time the battle raged furiously. It was found that the entire rebel army was in
						position behind hastily constructed works of logs. The cavalry had broken and fallen
						back in disorder. The cavalry train had been halted in the road, blocking it up against
						the advance of artillery and preventing the mass of retreating horsemen from escaping,
						except through the lines of infantry. The Fourth Division fought with desperation. The
						rebel lines were forced, only to be reformed. It had to oppose the entire rebel army,
						and the struggle was decided by numbers. Only 1,800 men, with a very small portion of
						the cavalry, were engaged on the Union side in this contest.</p>
					<p>The Federal lines being comparatively short, the extended lines of the enemy were
						enabled to close around this small force, and the retreat of a large portion was cut
						off. The cavalry retreated, leaving infantry, artillery and ammunition train at the
						mercy of the enemy. The infantry cut through, only to find itself again surrounded. The
						ammunition, after two hours' hard fighting, was exhausted, and a surrender was
						inevitable.</p>
					<p>Such was the condition of affairs when General Cameron arrived on the ground with the
						Third Division, numbering not over twelve hundred men. Line of battle was immediately
						formed with the First Brigade, composed of the Forty-sixth Indiana and five companies of
						the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, under Lieutenant Colonel A. M. Flory, on the right, and the
						Second Brigade, composed of the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-eighth Iowa, and the
						Fifty-sixth Ohio, under Colonel Raynor, on the left. The position of the division was on
						the edge of a wood, with an open plantation in front. It was about three-fourths of a
						mile across, with nothing to obstruct the view except an occasional swell of the ground.
							<pb id="VAB9258-089" n="89"/> The width of this open space was more than thrice the
						length of the front of the Third Division, now the only troops left to confront the
						enemy.</p>
					<p>The rebels, elated with their success, came pouring over the clearing in successive
						lines and closely massed columns. They were permitted to come within close rifle range
						before the Third Division opened upon them. The Federal position was such that,
						concealed behind logs and fences, it could not be located by the rebels, giving an
						unusually fine opportunity for deliberate aim. A deadly volley broke forth from the
						whole line, breaking the rebel ranks, hurling them back in confusion, and leaving the
						ground strewn with their dead and wounded. The rattle of the deadly rifle was unceasing,
						and the rebel slaughter terrible.</p>
					<p>The enemy rapidly retreated, but again formed heavier lines with fresh troops. Now was
						the time for the Nineteenth Corps to have been brought up, and, forming on the right and
						left, prevented the flanking by the enemy, through which they gained their victory. But
						that was not the arrangement. The Nineteenth Corps was four miles in the rear, in camp,
						and could not be brought up until the Third, like the Fourth Division, had been
						sacrificed. The rebel lines, numbering not less than 8,000, advanced again and again,
						but could not maintain themselves. Each time they were driven back by this little force
						of 1,200.</p>
					<p>Another but a feebler demonstration was made on the front by a small portion of the
						enemy, while the bulk of the force, under cover of the woods on either side, passed
						around to the flanks and rear of the Federal lines. This closed the contest. The
						division was surrounded. It maintained the line, and endeavored to fall back; but the
						rebels, actually coming among the men, forced them to break, to enable the few that
						could escape, to do so. The men fought to the last moment, and continued firing until
						forced to cease by capture, or by the want of ammunition. The struggling division fought
						from tree to tree, pursued by the rebel cavalry for a mile and a half, when the
						Nineteenth Corps, coming up, saved the remnant not killed or captured.</p>
					<p>The Nineteenth Corps drove back the rebels with considerable slaughter, and night
						coming on, the conflict ended for the day.</p>
					<p>The cavalry train being in the road, blocked it completely. The pine woods were so
						thick that artillery could not be moved through them, so it was impossible to bring off
						the wagon, artillery and ambulance trains, which fell into the hands of the rebels. The
							<pb id="VAB9258-090" n="90"/> cavalry train was heavily laden with commissary stores
						and officers' property, and furnished rich booty.</p>
					<p>This was the battle of Mansfield, or Sabine Cross Roads, where an expedition fitted out
						without regard to expense, finely appointed in every necessary material, with an army
						never before defeated--men who had stood at Vicksburg, Jackson, Port Hudson and Baton
						Rouge--was defeated and destroyed with the loss of material inestimable, and a sacrifice
						of life terrible to contemplate, through a plan of battle which threw into the fight
						detachments of troops only as fast as they could be destroyed. One of the great blunders
						of the war was committed here--one for which nobody, as yet, has been called to
						account.</p>
					<p>The loss of the Federal army at this battle was 600 killed and wounded, and 1,250
						captured. The loss of the rebels, as taken from their official reports, was 3,100, of
						whom, ten days after, 1,000 were dead. Texas and Louisiana were in mourning for the
						calamity that fell upon them. Very many prominent officers were killed. General Mouton,
						of Louisiana, and General Green, of Texas, the hope of the Confederacy (in that portion
						of it) were victims. Scarcely a company came out without the loss of all or nearly all
						of its commissioned officers, and the victory in every way was most dearly paid for.</p>

					</list>
					<p>Driving the rebels through Marksville, the lines passed over a plain. As a general
						engagement was expected, the entire Federal army was in line and in sight. Not less than
						25,000 men--infantry, cavalry and artillery--were visible at once. The cavalry on the
						front were dashing about, while lines of battle and columns of infantry, in support or
						reserve, and batteries, either in position or <pb id="VAB9258-094" n="94"/> getting into
						one, could be seen. On the front the artillery was pushed well out, and a short practice
						drove the rebels to their right. The Sixteenth Corps advanced rapidly on the left of our
						line, and turned the rebels back. The fight then rolled back to our line, but soon
						ceased with the retreat of the enemy. The rebels were driven to and through Mansura, a
						distance of four miles, where they disappeared. Meanwhile both towns had fires.</p>
					<p>After a halt of an hour for lunch, the division was again on the road. At 2 o'clock
						five miles were made from Mansura, and the regiment went into camp and slept on the bed
						of a bayou.</p>
					<p>At 3 o'clock on the morning of the 17th, the division was again on the road, without
						breakfast. Halted at 7, and made coffee. An attack was made on the rear of the column,
						but repulsed. The Third Division marched beside the wagon train, with an African brigade
						in front. A dash was made by the rebels upon the train, ahead of the negroes. They
						pushed ahead, repulsed the attack, and killed two rebels. One negro was killed and two
						wounded, and it was said that a rebel captain killed both the wounded men.</p>
					<p>Yellow bayou was reached in the afternoon. The trains were closed up, and haste was
						made to get the Thirteenth and Nineteenth Corps over before dark. The rebels were close
						up and constantly firing. The two corps got over and went into camp.</p>
					<p>Early on the 18th firing began on our pickets and outposts. The Sixteenth Corps had
						been left west of the bayou. General Mower's division was on the left, or the farthest
						west in the column. The rebel firing at 2 o'clock terminated in a determined charge by a
						heavy force. The rebels had twelve pieces of artillery and fought desperately. Mower
						beat them back, only to be again driven by them. The rebels charged twice with mounted
						infantry, but were repulsed with great loss.</p>
					<p>The Thirteenth Corps was held in camp all day. The fight was near enough to be plainly
						seen. The battle was fought near and on a large deadening. It soon took fire, and the
						smoke and flame more plainly marked the scene of carnage, and added to its horrors.</p>
					<p>During the entire afternoon the Thirteenth Corps was in line, expecting to be called
						out. Field officers had, without orders, called their regiments in line, anticipating
						the order to support the force in action. All over the camp men were at arms, artillery
						horses hitched up, officers in saddles all ready to dash out, but no <pb
							id="VAB9258-095" n="95"/> orders came. All that afternoon General A. J. Smith,
						commanding the Sixteenth Corps, and General Banks, commander-in-chief, were at the
						Atchafalaya bayou, not two miles from the conflict, and neglected to give an order that
						would have sent 15,000 men to the relief of General Mower's 4,000 that were being
						slaughtered by 8,000 rebels. Six hundred Federal soldiers were killed and wounded in
						this terrible fight. The rebel loss was 1,000. Many wounded men were burned in the fire
						of the burning deadening.</p>
					<p>On the 19th, the Third and Fourth Divisions were sent down the Atchafalaya, in search
						of rebels. Found but two, who were couriers, with dispatches. The divisions returned to
						the big pontoon and remained until morning.</p>
					<p>The pontoon was laid on steamers anchored close together. String pieces were bolted
						down across the decks, and, upon them, a floor of the flat cypress rails of the country
						was laid. It made a good bridge, but exceedingly crooked from the unequal height and
						length of the boats. Wagons, mules and men crossed on it. The artillery was ferried
						over. On both banks of the bayou, graves were dug for the dead of the day of the
						fight.</p>
					<p>The Forty-sixth passed over at 10 o'clock, the morning of the 20th, and marched two
						miles down. Here the regiment received a large mail, but the pleasure of the occasion
						was clouded in finding letters addressed to so many who would never receive them.
						Letters were also received from officers who were in prison.</p>
					<p>The march from Alexandria to the Atchafalaya was continuous. There was not a halt that
						could be counted on sufficient for cooking. Day and night the columns pressed on,
						stopping a minute or an hour, as compelled by circumstances. At each halt the men would
						lie down and sleep, or not, as time permitted, but there was no fixed time announced
						sufficient for rest or refreshment. The rebel army was constantly closely on the rear,
						and kept the retiring columns always on the alert. The sight of the Atchafalaya was most
						welcome, for it promised rest.</p>
					<p>At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the brigade started toward the Mississippi, nine miles
						distant. The road was blocked, and no move forward was made until 11 at night, when the
						sleepy line moved slowly on. Frequent halts were made, lasting from five minutes to half
						an hour.</p>
					<p>At 8 o'clock orders were passed to get breakfast, and crackers and coffee were enjoyed.
						In a short time the men were gladdened with the sight of the Mississippi river. The
						fleet of gunboats and <pb id="VAB9258-096" n="96"/> transports had already arrived, and
						were awaiting orders. General McGinnis, with some of his staff, had come from New
						Orleans to meet his division and resume his command.</p>
					<p>The Third Division had been commanded by General Cameron. The First Brigade was under
						Colonel Bringhurst. The Twenty-fourth and Twenty-eighth Iowa and the Forty-seventh
						Indiana were alternately in the First Brigade. Colonel Slack commanded the Second
						Brigade of the Third Division. Captain Henry Snyder, of Company E, had command of the
						Forty-sixth until he was. wounded, near Alexandria, when he was succeeded by Captain
						Liston.</p>
					<p>Upon arriving at the river, the brigade pushed on toward Morganza, twenty miles
						distant, marching until 8 o'clock. The men laid down to sleep, where they remained until
						3 o'clock in the morning, when they again started, and reached Morgan's Bend at
						noon.</p>
					<p>And now the unfortunate Red river campaign was over. An expedition, fitted out with the
						greatest care and liberality, had come to naught through the neglect of the controlling
						officers to regard the plainest military rules. Human life, money and prestige had been
						sacrificed for nothing.</p>
					<p>To the Forty-sixth the campaign had been one of especial hardship and suffering. It had
						marched and fought, almost continuously, from the 6th of March to the 22d of May. Its
						members had re-enlisted on the 2d of January, under a general and special promise of a
						thirty-day furlough home. Most of the men had not seen their families for over two years
						and a half, but were required to give up the anticipated pleasure and undertake a long,
						laborious and dangerous campaign. The regiment had marched over 800 miles, much of it in
						the night, and all of it in haste. Comparing the condition of the regiment now with what
						it was on re-enlistment, the men remembered with sorrow that over a third of their
						number now occupied a rebel prison, the hospital or the grave.</p>
					<p>The furlough question had been reopened shortly after the battle of Sabine Cross Roads,
						and the colonel was assured by General Banks that the regiment should go as soon as
						possible. At Alexandria it was possible to go, or at least to start, and the order was
						offered the regiment to go with the Fifty-sixth Ohio, and many were anxious to start,
						but, on the next day, when the men of the Fifty-sixth came straggling back, leading
						their wounded comrades, it was seen that it was the better judgment that preferred to
						wait.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-097" n="97"/>

					<p>No difficulty was apprehended in obtaining a furlough at Morganza, but, unfortunately,
						General Banks went straight from the Atchafalaya to New Orleans, which threw the
						business into new hands. As soon as Morganza was reached, Colonel Bringhurst visited
						General Emory, the then commanding officer, and presented the case. Emory was a
						"regular" officer, and had a higher regard for "red tape" than any other solid
						commodity. He immediately fell back on rules and regulations, and decided that the
						application must go on to General Banks through the regular channel. This would require
						much time, and the prospect clouded again. General McGinnis, and many of the Indiana
						officers, endeavored to move Emory, but to no purpose.</p>
					<p>In a few days it was found that a steamer was about starting down the river, and it was
						determined among the officers that the regiment would try another plan to get off. Just
						before the boat was ready to leave, the men, with their knapsacks and guns, quietly
						marched aboard. The steamer was loaded with army wagons, and little room could be found
						for the men, but they crowded in. The captain of the boat made no question about the
						presence of the regiment, as it was their custom to take what come.</p>
					<p>When ready, the boat turned out into the stream, but to the dismay of the officers in
						the plot she turned in and landed at General Emory's headquarters. The general's
						quartermaster came on board to give final orders. Seeing the regiment, he inquired for
						its authority to go. He was told that the colonel had the order. Diligent search failed
						to find that officer, and after considerable discussion he ordered the boat captain to
						go on.</p>
					<p>Another difficulty arose before the regiment. It was soon discovered that the steamer
						had orders for Baton Rouge and not New Orleans. But it was on the road to the city, and
						away from General Emory, and there was no fear that the regiment would not get
						through.</p>
					<p>At Baton Rouge the regiment went into camp and awaited events. The Twenty-fourth
						Indiana was there, and helped make the stay agreeable.</p>
					<p>On the third day the "Express," a fine, large new steamer, came down the river and
						rounded to at the landing. The colonel immediately went on board to negotiate, and in a
						few minutes the regiment was on the way to the city. The captain and the crew treated
						the men most hospitably, and just after daylight they were landed at Carrollton, five
						miles above the city.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-098" n="98"/>

					<p>On the voyage down, there was some mystery about the order for the regiment's shipment.
						When Adjutant Watts could be found the colonel had it, and when the latter was on hand
						the adjutant had it.</p>
					<p>At Carrollton the regiment went into camp, the best that could be done with no
						equipage, and the colonel went to see General Banks.</p>
					<p>There was no trouble with General Banks. That officer freely admitted all that was
						claimed for the regiment, and suggested things in their favor that had not been claimed.
						He told the colonel they should have their furlough and when they pleased. They could go
						home now or go into camp and prepare for it. In reply to the question, "What does the
						regiment want?" the colonel answered, "The men should be paid to April 30, have new
						clothes, new guns, twenty days at Carrollton, and a furlough for thirty days."</p>
					<p>The general told the colonel he should have it all, and directed him to make out his
						requisitions and they should be honored.</p>
					<p>The regiment went regularly into camp. It had good rations, light drills, put on good
						clothes, and in fifteen days was ready for home.</p>
					<p>In April, 1864, an expedition of four transports and gunboats went from New Orleans up
						the Sabine Pass into Calcasieu bay for cotton. A guard of thirty-seven men, from the
						non-veteran camp, in charge of a captain of the Thirtieth Maine, was on the boats. The
						fleet had arrived in the bay. The "Wave" and the "Granite City," while lying without
						steam, were attacked at daybreak, and captured. Among the prisoners were Maxwell Reece,
						R. V. McDowell, Hugh Quinn, Joshua T. Colvin, Philip M. Benjamin and Jacob Oliver. These
						were non-veterans of the Forty-sixth. Colvin subsequently died in prison at Tyler,
						Texas, and Oliver at Hempstead.</p>
					<p>About the same date, John Shea, a non-veteran of Company D, was killed and robbed at
						Algiers.</p>
					<p>Wm. McGlennen, of Company C, was shot and killed by a guard, in June, at Algiers.</p>

					</list>
					<p>On the 15th of June, 1864, the "Sultana," a fine large transport, port, rounded to at
						the landing and called for the Forty-sixth. The men soon packed up, and, with
						innumerable specimens of the <pb id="VAB9258-101" n="101"/> animal and vegetable
						kingdom, in boxes and cages, made a forced march for the steamer. In an hour everything
						was stowed and arranged, and the men, anticipating the voyage and the visit home,
						pronounced themselves perfectly happy.</p>
					<p>Without accident or any unusual occurrence, the regiment, in a few days, made the
						landing at Cairo. The colonel immediately called on the post quartermaster, with a
						requisition for transportation, by rail, to Indianapolis. Looking at the paper, the
						official noticed an item specifying sundry horses, and inquired if it was a cavalry
						regiment. He was informed that it was not; neither was it an artillery organization. The
						official then wanted an explanation of the presence of six horses in an infantry
						regiment on furlough. He said the order required transportation for so many men and
						officers, and he would not transport the horses.</p>
					<p>The quartermaster was told that the men and horses went together; that if the horses
						could not go the men would not. The colonel then made requisition for three days'
						rations and ordered the men into camp. The quartermaster told the colonel to move back
						off the levee, but the men were ordered to occupy a place on the front, which they did,
						and were soon at cooking. The city marshal tried to effect a removal, but he was
						referred to the quartermaster as the person who could relieve the town of the
						regiment.</p>
					<p>After dark the regiment seemed to become more numerous and expressive. Cooking was
						going on in many unnecessary places, and the merchants began to complain. At 10 o'clock
						the quartermaster sent down orders for transportation for horses and all.</p>
					<p>The men filled the box cars, enjoyed a good sleep, and, at early morn, were in
						Indianapolis.</p>
					<p>The line was formed, and the regiment marched to the Soldier's Home.</p>
					<p>The Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of June 23 thus speaks of the regiment:</p>

					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"The reception and welcome of the Forty-sixth Indiana took place yesterday, as
							announced, at the Soldier's Home and State-House Park. The column was formed at the
							Home at 11.30, and with the Colonel and Colonel James Blake at the head, escorted by
							the regimental and Hahn's bands, marched up Washington street to East, and back again
							to the Home, where a bountiful dinner was served by the ladies. It was partaken of by
							the regiment with a quiet satisfaction very becoming and gratifying to those who
							served it. The marching of the regiment through the city attracted attention,
							particularly for the manly bearing and handsome dress of the men, and the excellent
							condition of their arms. * * After dinner the <pb id="VAB9258-102" n="102"/> regiment
							again marched up Washington street, countermarched, and went to the State-house, where
							a large number of citizens, mostly ladies, had assembled to hear the welcome of the
							Governor, and other speeches. *</p>
						<p>"Governor Morton, in his address, said: 'This reception was given as a testimonial of
							the regard in which the Indiana soldiers were held by their friends here and
							throughout the State. He said the history of all the Indiana regiments was the same in
							one grand particular--they all had done their duty, honoring the cause and the State.
							* The Indiana soldiers have a double motive for doing well; first, because it is their
							principle to do so, and second, because an unjust stain had been cast upon their valor
							by a colonel of the Second Indiana, at Beuna Vista. The history of that regiment
							proved it a true regiment; but a mistake was made, and a wicked collusion between its
							colonel and Jeff Davis, had cast an unjust blame on the regiment. But that slander had
							been turned against its authors, and, to-day, Indiana soldiers stand as high in public
							estimation as those of any State."</p>
						<p>"The Governor feelingly alluded to the many brave men of the regiment who had fallen,
							and who will be remembered as the noble dead. The Governor then rehearsed the
							principal events in the history of the regiment, and said it had been one of the first
							to re-enlist, and should have come home long ago, but the exigencies of the service
							demanded more work, and it was on hand for duty. He wished to thank them particularly
							on behalf of the loyal and grateful people of Indiana for the proudest act in their
							career, their re-enlistment, as well as for all the other good they had done.</p>
						<p>"Colonel James Blake, representing the Mayor, welcomed the veterans home. He said he
							wanted to welcome them especially on behalf of their veteran lady friends, some of
							whom they had met at the Soldier's Home. These ladies had become veterans by their
							constant and untiring service for the soldier. He also welcomed them to the city on
							behalf of the business men, who had never failed to sustain the soldier. He honored
							the regiment for its manly bearing; they looked and acted like men who knew and
							respected their relation to society, to the country, and to one another. The officers
							seemed to recognize their true position, and their relations with the men seemed
							fraternal.</p>
						<p>"Hearty cheers were then given for the Governor, Colonel Blake and the ladies.
							Colonel Bringhurst made an appropriate response to the Governor and Colonel
							Blake."</p></q>

					<p>The regiment reached Logansport on the afternoon of June 23. The following account of
						its reception, from the Logansport <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of the 25th, correctly
						represents the warm welcome accorded it:</p>

					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>"A multitude, numbering thousands, gathered at the depot to welcome them, and they
							were somewhat disappointed when the train stopped and no soldiers made their
							appearance. But the disappointment was soon turned to rejoicing when it was discovered
							that the officers, by a wise strategem, had stopped the soldiers at a place where the
							regiment could be formed <pb id="VAB9258-103" n="103"/> without interference from the
							crowd of friends who had assembled to greet its arrival.</p>
						<p>"The regiment soon made its appearance, headed by its own martial band, marching by
							column of companies. At the foot of Fourth street, the Logan Band took the front and
							the Logan Union Silver Band brought up the rear.</p>
						<p>"The regiment, escorted by thousands of citizens, marched up Fourth street to Market,
							up Market to Seventh, down Seventh to Broadway, down Broadway to Fourth, and up Fourth
							to the Court-house, where it was formed in column of division, when Judge Biddle
							welcomed the soldiers in an eloquent address; after which occurred the most beautiful
							incident of the occasion: two hundred little girls, appropriately dressed in the
							national colors, advanced and presented a beautiful bouquet to every officer and
							soldier. This tribute of the children to valor and patriotism will long be remembered
							by the brave men to whom it was paid.</p>
						<p>"The men then stacked arms and surrounded the two long tables, set in the yard, which
							fairly groaned under the weight of good things which the patriotic ladies of the city
							had prepared for the occasion.</p> * * * * * * * * * <p>"After dinner a short time was
							spent in giving and receiving the warm greetings of friends long parted, when the
							regiment was again formed and marched to Market space for dress parade. The
							proficiency of the regiment for drill was fully established by its performance on the
							march, and at the parade.</p>
						<p>"It will be the pride and pleasure of our citizens to make the short visit of these,
							our war-worn veterans, as pleasant as possible, as it will be their pleasure ever to
							cherish in grateful remembrance their toils and sacrifices in defense of our
							institutions.</p>
						<p>"While rejoicing in the presence of our returned friends we do not forget those of
							their comrades who having made their last sacrifice, now repose in our cemeteries,
							upon the banks of the "Father of Waters," or in unknown graves. Their memory shall
							ever be fresh in our hearts. Nor do we forget those who are captives, far from friends
							and home. For them our prayers ascend. At home or at the front, sick, wounded or
							prisoners, our soldiers will receive the warm sympathy of the loyal men of the
							country; and when Peace shall spread her wings over our distracted land they will be
							the honored sons of a grateful people, transmitting a rich legacy of heroic patriotism
							to the generations who shall succeed them."</p>
					</q>
					<p>Before the dinner, Judge Biddle delivered an address, which was listened to by citizens
						and soldiers with deep attention. He said:</p>

					<q rend="blockquote">
						<p>O<hi rend="sc">FFICERS AND</hi> S<hi rend="sc">OLDIERS OF THE</hi> F<hi rend="sc"
								>ORTY</hi>-S<hi rend="sc">IXTH</hi>:</p>
						<p>V<hi rend="sc">ETERANS</hi>: In the name of this city and county, I welcome you home.
							In the name of the State of Indiana, in the name of the United States--for, thank God,
							by the courage and patriotism of our noble soldiers, <pb id="VAB9258-104" n="104"/> we
							still have a United States--I welcome you home. In the name of liberty and humanity, I
							welcome you home. Thrice welcome to your homes and friends.</p>
						<p>Nearly three years ago you pledged your lives to the standard of your country; you
							were organized and left for the field. You went to Camp Wickliffe, thence, by the
							river fleet, to Commerce and to Island No. 10, where you aided in flanking the enemy
							in that stronghold. At New Madrid you were introduced to the fire of the enemy, and,
							with your comrades, made him surrender the post. Next, at Riddle's Point, you alone
							sustained yourselves against the terrible and galling fire of five rebel gunboats. Do
							you remember that? Do you remember the toil of that long, gloomy and weary night,
							during which you gained your position? Aye, you remember it; your country remembers
							it. From this well-fought field, you went with General Pope's fleet down the
							Mississippi river to Fort Pillow, where you remained some weeks with the Forty-third,
							and left it not until you had planted the flag of your country--this flag--on the
							ramparts of the enemy. Thence down the river to Memphis, where you tore down to the
							dust the defiant flag of the rebellion, and felled its towering staff to the earth.
							The trophy was secured by your hands. Soon after this you went up White river to
							relieve General Curtis. In this expedition with our gunboats you suffered severely
							with heat and toil, but you humbled the enemy of your country, and rebuked him for his
							inhumanity. At St. Charles you witnessed the terrible explosion of the Mound City, and
							the heart-rending sufferings of your comrades in arms. But we cannot tarry. You
							descended the river to Helena, where you did good service in opening rivers,
							skirmishing, etc., for several weeks, and where the memorable repulse of the arrant
							rebel, Price, took place. At Pemberton you fought right under the bristling guns of
							the fort, and within a few yards of our own gunboat Chillicothe. The courage of man
							was seldom more severely tried than yours in this fight, and never was the test better
							withstood. Next, before Vicksburg; then through all those severe battles at Port
							Gibson, Champion Hills, Jackson and other places on the route, when not only your
							prowess in battle, but your strength of endurance in toiling and marching, was proved
							to be of the first order. After beating and chasing the enemy in every direction, he
							was invested at Vicksburg, where you lay in the trenches during forty-three days,
							toiling and fighting until he fell, and you entered the city with your comrades in
							triumph. Then, the day after the surrender, you marched to Jackson, where you
							completed the triumph of the campaign. From this place you were taken to New Orleans.
							Then your expedition into Texas and battle at Carancro bayou, La., will be ever
							memorable. Back to New Orleans; and here you did one of the noblest acts of your
							lives--you re-enlisted for the war--and it was the desire of the Government then to
							give you the furlough which you are now about to enjoy, but the exigency of the
							service would not allow it; you submitted cheerfully, as became good soldiers and true
							patriots. Hence you were taken into the severe campaign of Red river, where our arms,
							for a time, were unfortunate. Under every disaster, you comported yourselves as
							veterans, and wherever the fault <pb id="VAB9258-105" n="105"/> might be, if fault
							there was, no part of it was attached to the glorious and gallant Forty-sixth.</p>
						<p>"You are now before us, but where are the comrades in arms that went out with you,
							1,000 strong, to do battle for the country and for mankind, while you, less than 200,
							have returned? Alas! they are not here. Some are languishing in exile as prisoners of
							war, but their hearts are with us and our hearts are with them. Others are lying
							buried along the valleys of the Mississippi and White rivers, and on the plains of Red
							river, but their spirits are with us now. Your comrades who are prisoners, will soon
							be exchanged and return to our arms; but for those who are locked in the prison-house
							of death, there is no return to us. We must follow them. Sad is the suggestion of your
							return to those whose sons and brothers have perished in battle. Let us weep with them
							for a time, for tears not ill become the brave. * * * But it is a noble death to die
							for one's country. How can we die nobler or better?</p>
						<p>"Thus have I briefly traced your course from your departure to your return. Fond
							hearts and tearful eyes have followed and watched your every step and every deed,
							daily and hourly, during your absence. While you are with us, as you have done in the
							field, prove yourselves triumphant.</p>
						<p>"You have brought home the rugged laurels of the soldier, and innocent maidens will
							give you wreaths of flowers to twine with them. They welcome you back from your
							dangers. Their tender arms ill befit the battlefield, and they look to you for
							protection. You will give it to them. Remember, each one of you is dear to some heart,
							and I trust that each of you has some object of love, reverence or affection to keep
							your hearts true to yourselves, your country and your God."</p></q>
					<p>On the conclusion of the dress parade, the regiment was dismissed until the 26th of
						July, when it would be necessary to return to the field.</p>
					<p>On the 20th of July the colonel published an order requiring the members of the
						regiment to assemble at Logansport, on the 26th. At the appointed time, every one was
						present excepting three, who were sick. A difficulty in obtaining transportation
						prevented the departure until the 27th, when the regiment started for Indianapolis, by
						way of Lafayette. The Capital was reached in the evening, and the regiment took up
						quarters in the general camp of the State.</p>
					<p>On the 28th, an order was received from General Heintzleman, requiring the Forty-third
						and Forty-sixth to remain until further orders.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained quietly in camp until the 11th of August, when orders were
						received for an immediate march. On the 12th, the regiment took the cars for Evansville.
						Arrived at Terre Haute at 2 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> Met exaggerated rumors of the
						devastation <pb id="VAB9258-106" n="106"/> being wrought by the rebels on the river.
						Arrived at Evansville at dark, where the regiment was quartered on a wharfboat, and, in
						the morning, the men were pleased in being led to a beautiful grove half a mile from
						town.</p>
					<p>At 3 o'clock on the next (Sunday) morning, the word came that the rebels were crossing
						the river at Shawneetown, twenty-three miles below by land. At 9 o'clock, the regiment
						was on an old mail boat, and steaming down the river. At 6 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> the
						regiment landed at Mount Vernon. Here the people were all under arms. The "legion" had
						flowed in from the surrounding country, and everybody was awaiting an attack. Firing had
						been heard at Shawneetown, up to noon, but none since, so it was surmised that the war
						would soon begin. The artillery was in battery on the levee, and the river front was
						covered with people. The regiment was received with hearty cheers. General Hovey was
						home on leave, and the men were rejoiced to see him.</p>
					<p>The regiment marched to the Court-house square, and prepared to spend the night. The
						citizens furnished an abundance of coffee.</p>
					<p>At midnight a courier from below reported the rebels in possession of several boats and
						a force sufficient to attack Shawneetown and Mount Vernon. About that time a railroad
						ferryboat, from Pittsburg, bound for the Mississippi, rounded to at the landing. It was
						new and capable of carrying a thousand men. The colonel impressed the boat, and, before
						daylight, the regiment was on board and on the way down the river, without the knowledge
						of the good people of Mount Vernon.</p>
					<p>The rebel towns along the river were passed without molestation, and the boats reached
						Shawneetown at 10 o'clock. Along the Illinois and Indiana side of the river the boat
						passed continuous squads of the legion rushing to the front.</p>
					<p>At Shawneetown the people were all on hand. They extended a hearty welcome to the
						regiment. That point being safe, it was concluded to go on to Sabine river, where the
						rebels were. A six-pound gun was borrowed, and the ferryboat again pushed out. The
						legion wanted to go, and it was with difficulty that they were kept off, so anxious were
						they for gore. The seat of war was reached at 2 o'clock. The rebels had fallen back,
						leaving a small force on the river. A small gunboat, the <hi rend="i">Fairplay</hi>, on
						which were Lieutenants Washington Coulson and George Groves, of Logansport, was shelling
						the rebels on the bank. After notifying the <pb id="VAB9258-107" n="107"/> gunboat, the
						regiment landed and skirmished inland, driving the rebels before it. Finding no force
						that would stand, in an hour the regiment returned to the boat. The barges and boats of
						the rebels were destroyed. The three steamers captured by the rebels had been released
						by them. They were loaded with cattle for Sherman, and, when the approach of the rebels
						was noticed, the cattle were thrown into the river. The most of them were saved; those
						that swam to the Kentucky side were lost, except a few that were subsequently recovered
						by the Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>The regiment returned to Shawneetown to arrange a raid inland. The ferryboat was
						returned to the party in charge, with thanks, and the regiment occupied the "Jennie
						Hopkins," one of the captured boats.</p>
					<p>The regiment then returned to Mount Vernon, and became part of a force organized for a
						raid into Kentucky, toward Morganfield, by General Hovey.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the arrival of the regiment at Mount Vernon, Dan Rice's circus boat
						came up to the landing. It made quite an imposing appearance. Its band played its most
						seductive airs, and the lady and gentlemen actors displayed their gayest attire. With
						the soldiers in town, the management calculated on a crowded house and large receipts.
						But in a little while the horses were impressed to haul the artillery, and some of the
						show animals to mount the men. Lamentation abounded on the circus boat that day, but the
						company still had hope, and went on with the preparations necessary for a regular
						performance in the evening.</p>
					<p>While at Indianapolis some designing men had imposed upon the boys a lot of
						advertisements, in the semblance of greenbacks. They looked very much like five-dollar
						bills. On the morning after the show the treasurer of the institution waited on the
						colonel with a package of the bills, and requested fifty dollars in lieu of it. His
						explanation of the transaction was that he had received them at the circus entrance. He
						had marveled at the predominance of five-dollar bills, but had suspected nothing, and
						had promptly made change. The treasurer recapitulated the items in the company's bad
						luck, and promised to collect full damages from the government. </p>
					<p>The preparations for the Kentucky raid were hastily made at Mount Vernon. A detatchment
						of cavalry militia came from Evansville by land, and a battery of four guns by the
						river. The country around Mount Vernon turned out about 200 men on foot, and a <pb
							id="VAB9258-108" n="107"/> company of cavalry. A battery of two guns went from Mount
						Vernon. To mount the cavalry and haul the guns, horses were impressed. Some were
						contributed. The Thirty-second Indiana, which was at Indianapolis for discharge, joined
						the expedition.</p>
					<p>The cavalry marched along the river opposite Uniontown. The infantry and artillery left
						Mount Vernon on the 17th on the transports "Jennie Hopkins," "General Halleck" and the
						"Cottage." These were found to be overloaded. A portion of the men was transferred to
						the circus boat, and she was compelled to make the trip. The company had recovered its
						good humor, and the members were waving adieus to the soldiers from their deck. The band
						was playing patriotic airs, when the rush of soldiers on the boat changed the
						situation.</p>
					<p>The expedition, with the Forty-sixth in advance, landed at Uniontown, and placed guards
						around the town. The circus boat came in last, and the company was again in good humor.
						The band was playing and the ladies were waving their handkerchiefs. Horses were
						obtained to relieve the circus company, when it made haste to leave for a more
						profitable country.</p>
					<p>At 2 o'clock the column was on the march for Morganfield, eight miles distant. Rebels
						were met at different points, but they fled without a fight.</p>
					<p>On the 18th, General Paine arrived with a force from Paducah, not knowing that General
						Hovey had left Mount Vernon. Major General Hughes, of the Indiana malitia, was also on
						the ground.</p>
					<p>On the 19th, the column started for Henderson, twenty-five miles distant, on the river.
						At Smith's mills a squad of rebels were met and captured. Henderson was reached at 2
						o'clock on the 20th, when the motley collection of soldiers was disposed of. Boats were
						sent to Evansville and to Mount Vernon. Trouble arose about the destination of some
						fifty negroes, who had followed the column to the river, The draft order was in force
						and the negroes were good for substitutes. Both the towns named wanted the negroes, and
						the crowd went from boat to boat, as the inducement of either boat predominated.
						Finally, it was discovered that a comely colored girl was the ruling factor in the
						business. The people of one town captured the girl and led the entire party to their
						boat.</p>
					<p>The Forty-sixth remained at Henderson until 4 o'clock on the 21st, when it left that
						city and arrived at Evansville at 5 o'clock. William Dillon, of Company G, the only
						member of the regiment injured, was seriously shot in the leg.</p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-109" n="109"/>

					<p>The regiment left Evansville on the morning of the 24th of August, for Louisville,
						which was reached before daylight on the 26th. Just before landing at Portland a rebel
						prisoner fell overboard. It was never known whether he reached the shore or the
						bottom.</p>
					<p>The regiment marched the three miles between Portland and Louisville in a flood of
						rain, and found no quarters prepared for it. Quarters were finally secured in some old
						barracks, formerly occupied by prisoners or passing troops.</p>
					<p>At 9 o'clock on the 27th the regiment was loaded into box cars, which had just brought
						in a load of horses, and started for Lexington.</p>
					<p>At Lexington the post was in charge of a Kentucky regiment as a provost guard, which
						was not remarkable for good discipline, cleanliness or general efficiency. As soon as
						the Forty-sixth had settled in camp the men polished up and a dress parade was had at
						the Court-house square. All did and looked well, and the next day the Kentucky regiment
						was relieved and the Forty-sixth put on provost duty.</p>
					<p>A review was held by General Burbridge. Six regiments of infantry, two of cavalry and a
						battery were in line. The appearance of the Forty-sixth satisfied its friends.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 13th the regiment left Lexington for Cincinnati, and on the 14th,
						in the evening, crossed the river and went on board the "Cottage, No. 2," and, at 11
						o'clock, started up the river. The boat was crowded with military stores for the Big
						Sandy, and the accommodations for the men were bad. Company B was left at Covington to
						bring up property unavoidably left. Arrived at Cattletsburg on the 16th, and the freight
						and Companies C, E, G and K were loaded on five very small steamers and started up the
						Big Sandy. Companies A, E, D and H marched by the road. The former, after much
						difficulty from low water, reached Louisa, twenty-five miles, on the morning of the
						18th. The others arrived in the afternoon.</p>
					<p>At Louisa the stores and regimental property were loaded on push boats. Companies C and
						G first started with three boats, the men having been furnished with convenient poles
						for pushing, and, as the boats with their crews passed the soldiers on shore, those
						afloat were benefitted with instructions and advice unlimited. The men had no experience
						in this sort of navigation, and were not expert in the use of poles. The propelling
						power would be <pb id="VAB9258-110" n="110"/> unequally applied, and the vessel would
						turn around, go back, or get aground. The distance to be made in this way was forty-two
						miles.</p>
					<p>On the next day, Company F shouldered poles and started with a boat, with instructions
						not to run into the boats ahead, and Companies I, E and K started along the bank.
						Companies A and H remained at Louisa, as a guard. Company B arrived on the 19th and
						marched by land.</p>
					<p>Rations and forage had been brought up by flats. From Louisa, there was no wagon road.
						The work of bringing up the stores was done, mainly, by the Forty-sixth. The men
						cheerfully did all the duty required of them, and it proved the hardest of their
						experience. They were wet nearly all the time, and without shelter at night. When the
						water was low, the men were compelled to get into the river and work the boats over
						shoals. The exposure and fatigue were constant. Some of the boats were ten days on the
						trip. The cargoes were wet by the rain, and spoiled. Lieutenant Brownlie had charge of a
						crew that was particularly unfortunate. He "stuck," a few miles below Prestonburg, and
						reported that the rain had started the oats, with which he was loaded, to growing, and
						that there was a good pasture all over the boat from the new crop, growing through the
						sacks.</p>
					<p>The Burbridge expedition started on the 28th of September from Prestonsburg. It was
						composed entirely of cavalry and mounted infantry, with two howitzers. There were no
						wagons or ambulances. The objective point was supposed to be Abington, Virginia, where
						extensive salt works were said to be in operation.</p>
					<p>The Forty-sixth was to remain at Prestonsburg, protect the rear and bring forage up
						from Louisa. The duty of the regiment was not light. The river rose ten feet and wrecked
						every boat that was on the raging deep, and the storm-tossed mariners straggled into
						camp in a famishing condition. On the 6th of October the expedition began to straggle
						in. Generals Burbridge and McLain, with their staff and escorts, came in and went down
						the river on a flat. The head of the column, under General Hobson, made its appearance
						the next day. The expedition had failed, and with great loss. There were not less than
						400 wounded, beside from 100 to 200 killed. The town seemed to be covered with wounded,
						particularly colored men. The Forty-sixth was again left to take care of the wounded and
						the prisoners, and ship out the forage.</p>



					<pb id="VAB9258-111" n="111"/>

					<p>The last of the expedition had come in, and, with General Hobson, started for Mount
						Sterling and Lexington by the 10th. They left Prestonsburg covered with property, and
						wounded men and hundreds of horses were without care. Boats from below were due, but it
						was found that boats bound up had been turned back by troops going down, and it became
						certain that only one could be depended on. In addition to a large amount of stores,
						there were 300 sick and wounded. The rebel prisoners numbered sixty. They had been
						hurried along with the cavalry, and were not in a condition to walk. These were mounted
						on horses, and, under guard, sent toward Louisa. The stores were piled up on the bank,
						to be shipped or destroyed, as became necessary. The crippled horses were shot. Rafts,
						made from old houses, carried some stores. The artillery was hauled off by horses and
						oxen. By the evening of the 11th everything was out or loaded on a boat that had come
						up, and on the morning of the 12th of October the regiment was ferried over the river
						and took up the march for Louisa, where it arrived at noon on the 13th.</p>
					<p>At Louisa the regiment received orders to take charge of the post. On the 16th Company
						A was sent to Lexington, with the wounded, the sick, the prisoners and guns. On the same
						day the regiment was ordered to Cattletsburg, to take charge of that post. Companies F,
						D, C, E, H and G were left at Louisa, and B and I marched to Cattletsburg by land.</p>
					<p>On the 21st the regiment was relieved by the Sixteenth Kentucky, and had orders to go
						to Nashville, but another order, received at the same time, revoked it. On the 24th of
						November the regiment took passage on the fine steamer "Telegraph" for Cincinnati, and
						landed there the next morning. At 7 o'clock in the evening the "Major Anderson" was
						boarded for Louisville, where the regiment arrived the following morning.</p>
					<p>The train for Lexington was taken at 3.30 <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi>, and the regiment
						was in its old quarters at 11 o'clock.</p>
					<p>The next day the regiment was put on provost duty, in different parts of the city.
						Before leaving Cattletsburg, the companies left at Louisa were ordered down.</p>
					<p>From the last arrival of the Forty-sixth regiment to its discharge, its history was
						uneventful. The officers were on detached duty nearly all the time, either at Louisville
						or Lexington. Colonels Bringhurst and Flory were on military commissions or courts
						martial in both cities, and Captain Brough served in that capacity <pb id="VAB9258-112"
							n="112"/> in Lexington. The companies were, generally, on special duty. The rebel and
						Federal prisons were in charge of the regiment, and all the guards were furnished from
						the regiment. Captain Chamberlain was appointed provost marshal.</p>
					<p>The military commissions had jurisdiction over the guerrilla cases, and a large number
						of them were tried. Where the accused was convicted, the penalty was, generally, death,
						but the commandant at Louisville was too easily influenced to permit many executions.
						Two guerrillas were hung at Lexington and one at Louisville. The Louisville commission
						tried the celebrated guerrilla, "Sue Mundy." With a body of men, this man had been
						raiding over the State, murdering every soldier he found unprotected. He was captured on
						Sunday, tried on Monday and hung on Wednesday. Mundy was tried on the single charge of
						shooting a convalescent soldier returning to his regiment from the hospital. The squad
						of soldiers were all butchered, but the one man recovered and was able to testify
						against the murderer. The trial lasted just one hour, when the condemned man was
						returned to the guard-house to prepare for the scaffold.</p>
					<p>Mundy's proper name was M. Jerome Clark. He was young, well formed, and wore his hair
						long and in curls. The execution took place within the city, and many thousands were out
						to witness it. Captain George Swope, of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry, as provost marshal,
						officiated.</p>
					<p>Immediately after the execution, an exciting scene occurred. As the immense crowd was
						making its way back, an enraged bull took the middle of the road and disputed the
						crowd's passage. Pistols were fired at him, only to increase his rage. The people in the
						rear, supposing that a "rescue" was on hand, closed up and increased the panic, and it
						was not until the animal was killed that order was restored.</p>
					<p>At Lexington, as provost marshal, Captain Chamberlain had. two guerrillas to hang at
						one time. Anxious to give the condemned all the time allowed--until 4 o'clock--he
						delayed proceedings as long as possible, but the chaplain, Mr. Green, abbreviated the
						exercises more than was anticipated, and, at the conclusion, there was still some time
						to spare. After consulting with the officers, Chamberlain asked the chaplain to make
						another prayer, which he did; but, before the conclusion, a man on a horse, without a
						hat and waving a handkerchief, was seen riding furiously toward the place. He proved to
						be the aid of the post commandant, <pb id="VAB9258-113" n="113"/> with an order from
						General Palmer, postponing the execution twenty days. The reprieved man shook hands with
						his partner, and was shoved into a carriage, and the other was hung, just inside the
						time.</p>
					<p>The reprieved man was again brought to the gallows, and again, at the last moment,
						reprieved. Subsequently, he was taken to Louisville, and the case was heard of no
						more.</p>
					<p>On the return of the regiment to Louisville the courts sitting at Lexington were
						dissolved, and the officers composing them went with their regiments. A military
						commission had just found guilty and sentenced to death a man taken as a spy. At
						Louisville, as the president and judge advocate of the commission were standing by the
						stove, they were astonished by the condemned man walking in with his budget on his back,
						and offering his hand for a friendly shake. He was ignorant of the result of the trial,
						and evidently had not considered the situation serious. He explained that, seeing the
						men leaving, guards and all, he "had come along with the boys." The officers took the
						man with them to supper, and afterward to the prison, where he was left in charge of the
						provost marshal. On the next day the officers visited General Palmer, represented the
						facts, and obtained a disapproval of the finding.</p>
					<p>In December the Sabine Cross Roads prisoners began to come back. All bore evidence of
						the terrible treatment to which they had been subjected. They were given the furlough to
						which they were doubly entitled by their extraordinary service and suffering. They
						learned then, and they know now, that a grateful country will never forget what they did
						for it.</p>
					<p>John McTaggart, of Company D, was shot in the left leg, at Sabine Cross Roads. The limb
						was shattered. When hit, McTaggart sought shelter behind a log. Near him, behind a tree,
						a rebel was picking off Federal soldiers at his leisure and in supposed security. Under
						a sudden impulse, McTaggart shot the rebel dead. Straggling rebels robbed McTaggart of
						everything except his canteen, and finally a rebel cavalryman, with drawn saber,
						compelled him to give up that article. He was finally rolled on a blanket and carried
						and dragged over a mile to a rebel hospital. Here the limb was amputated, and for weeks
						he laid at the point of death. Becoming able to travel, he was sent down the river, and
						finally, after much suffering, reached New Orleans. In July, with an invoice of sick and
						wounded, he arrived at Indianapolis, and was <pb id="VAB9258-114" n="114"/> switched off
						to a hospital outside the city. An officer while home on the furlough, hearing of an
						estray member of the regiment, went to the hospital and brought McTaggart to
						Logansport.</p>
					<p>Chaplain Robb was captured at Sabine Cross Roads. Faithful to his duty, he was at the
						front with his regiment. When it was surrounded the chaplain rendered all the assistance
						he could to the wounded and suffering. When the fight was over, and the rebels began the
						business of gathering the prisoners, he looked for some invitation to march off with
						some of the numerous squads that were being herded and driven away, but he was left
						unnoticed, and he finally began to inquire about what time they would want to take him
						prisoner. Now, the chaplain was at a disadvantage in not being in uniform. He was
						dressed in a black suit, much polished with wear. He was enveloped in a long black coat,
						and ornamented with a well-worn black plug hat. Naturally the chaplain had not a
						belligerent appearance. After some importunity, however, Mr. Robb obtained an order to
						"fall in with that squad," and marched to Mansfield. After considerable correspondence
						and delay he was finally released and sent back. "Father Robb" will never be forgotten
						by any member of the Forty-sixth regiment. He was a practical Christian. He lived his
						faith. On the march, in camp, in hospital or in battle, he was with his men, devoting
						his strength and offering his life in the effort to benefit them.</p>
					<p>After the return of the prisoners from their furlough, the regiment had an aggregate of
						396 men, of whom 330 were present.</p>
					<p>While at Cattletsburg, a Colonel Jacob, lieutenant governor of Kentucky, was brought
						from Lexington under guard, on his way out of the Federal lines, under a sentence of
						General Burbridge. The absence of the gentleman was desirable, so Captain Fitch, with a
						detail and a flag, conveyed him out to the rebels.</p>
					<p>In February, three daughters of the rebel general Breckinridge were escorted by Captain
						Fitch, to Prestonsburg, via Cattletsburg, where a rebel escort met them and conveyed
						them toward Richmond.</p>
					<p>Elmore Shelt, of Company K, while on guard at the rebel prison, shot and killed a
						prisoner, March 24. An investigation exonerated Shelt and justified him.</p>
					<p>Joseph Kilgore, of Company C, was shot and killed by a Kentucky soldier, while the
						latter was on duty. The responsibility was put on Kilgore. The deceased was in company
						with William McGlennen, when the latter was killed by a guard at Algiers. </p>


					<pb id="VAB9258-115" n="115"/>

					<p>The assassination of the President created a profound sensation. The regret expressed
						by the rebels was evidently sincere. They expected a more favorable settlement from
						Lincoln than they could from his successor.</p>
					<p>Rebel deserters came in, in squads. Officers and soldiers were homeward bound in
						droves. The regiment had dress parade for the edification of some of them, to the
						gratification of all.</p>
					<p>On June 5th the regiment moved from Lexington to Louisville, leaving the colonel and
						Captain Brough on court marshal.</p>
					<p>Sherman's army was coming into Louisville at the rate of a thousand a day. A
						magnificent reception was accorded the general. On the 4th of July he reviewed the army,
						and it was a grand affair. There seemed to be no difference in public sentiment. The
						people of Kentucky were learning something.</p>
					<p>An order was received from the war department requiring the wish of each officer on the
						subject of remaining in the service. No attention was paid to it. Men and officers
						wanted to return home, as the war was virtually over, but they wanted to go together.
						They had been associated together so long, and passed through so many scenes of death
						and danger in company, that they wanted to stay until all could go.</p>
					<p>Many of the officers had enlisted as private soldiers. All had been promoted; the
						promotions were earned by faithful service. It was afterwards understood that the
						purpose of the order was to transfer a number to the regular army. Had it included the
						privates, some advantage might have been taken of it.</p>
					<p>The regiment remained at Louisville, Kentucky, doing light duty, until it was mustered
						out of the service. It furnished guards, orderlies and clerks at the headquarter
						departments, at stores and hotels. For a time the latter were withdrawn, when there was
						a general petitioning for their return. One extensive business man wrote: "There have
						never been men in service in this city who have excelled these in prompt and efficient
						duty, universal sobriety and gentlemanly conduct."</p>
					<p>A general officer, in response to a communication from the colonel, in relation to the
						discharge of the regiment, said: "The Forty-sixth has had the fortune, good or bad,
						always to please commandants under whose authority it has been placed. Both on the field
						and in garrison, its officers and men have given such satisfaction as to have been given
						up with reluctance by those in command. This has now much to do in keeping the regiment
						in the service."</p>




					<pb id="VAB9258-116" n="116"/>
					<p>The regiment was mustered out at Louisville on the 4th of September, 1865. It was
						transported to Indianapolis and there paid off, on the 11th.</p>
					<p>And so, the "Forty-sixth Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry" passed into history. Its
						members having faithfully served their terms of enlistment and re-enlisted, were again
						merged into the citizenship of the Nation. All felt proud of the record of their
						regiment, for no page of it brought discredit to its members. or the State.</p>

					<p rend="center b">THE MARCH TO CAMP FORD.</p>

					<p><hi rend="b">A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi></hi> their capture, the prisoners were rapidly
						pushed to the rear. Along the road from the battlefield to Mansfield, four miles, the
						road was strewn with dead rebels and the debris of the battle. The wounded were being
						gathered up. The country was covered with temporary hospitals, to which the rebels were
						carrying their crowds of wounded.</p>
					<p>At Mansfield 200 prisoners were crowded into the Court-house, and at night were
						confined in a room not large enough for half the number. This room had been used by
						rebel troops for quarters, and was filled with filth--being in such a condition as might
						be expected under the circumstances. The rest of the prisoners were corralled on a
						freshly plowed field, near the town, and compelled to get what rest they might, after a
						twenty miles' march and two hours' hard fighting, on the ground--saturated as it was
						with the recent rains. Nothing of any consequence had been eaten since five o'clock that
						morning. Most of the men had lost their knapsacks in the fight, and, with nothing except
						the clothing they stood in, hungry and exhausted, they began a long and torturing
						imprisonment. The cold north wind chilled the blood and benumbed the bodies of the
						captives, and they esteemed their sufferings great; but the time was to come when they
						could look back on this night as pleasantly passed, compared with many in their
						experience.</p>
					<p>On the morning of the 9th, the day after the battle, the entire capture was assembled
						and moved forward toward their destination, in Texas. No rations whatever were issued to
						the prisoners. </p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-118" n="118"/>

					<p>Chilled, hungry and weary, this band, numbering fifty commissioned officers and 1,200
						men, was goaded forward between two lines of rebel cavalry, flushed with a temporary
						success, void of all the principles of manhood, or the honor of a soldier, and filled
						with a ferocity developed by their losses and their triumphs. The most insulting
						epithets were heaped on the defenseless men; and those who, from sickness or exhaustion,
						reeled in the ranks, were treated with a degree of barbarity almost beyond belief.</p>
					<p>At 6 o'clock in the evening, after a march of twenty-four miles, the staggering column
						was turned into an open field, with an unbroken fast of two days. About 10 o'clock a
						small allowance of wood was given the prisoners, a pint of musty corn-meal, with a small
						quantity of salt beef, no salt, and one baking pan to each 100 men. There was no water
						within a quarter of a mile. Eight or ten men were taken out at a time, to fill canteens,
						of which a very small number had escaped the notice of the rapacious captors on the
						field. The entire night was spent in trying to make a meal from the scanty material at
						hand, a task almost impossible.</p>
					<p>At daybreak, on the 10th, the haggard procession was again put in motion, and marched
						twenty-five miles. During this day's march, many men were forced along by the bayonet
						and by threats of shooting.</p>
					<p>About the same rations were issued as on the evening before, with the addition of an
						abundant supply of water from a creek. In keeping with the consideration generally shown
						the prisoners by the guards, they encamped above the prisoners, and washed their horses
						and their own persons in the stream, and in other ways rendered the water as filthy as a
						systematic endeavor could make it.</p>
					<p>After marching and halting for sixteen days, the point of destination was reached. The
						women and children from the country, on either side of the road for miles, congregated
						in motley groups to witness the rare sight. The doors and windows of every house were
						filled with crowds of haggard women, white-headed children and naked negroes, of all
						sizes and ages. Old men and boys were posting hurriedly to the front, armed with every
						conceivable weapon known to the gunsmith of the last century, and mounted on every
						possible animal. Confederate flags were displayed in abundance--fit emblems of treachery
						and villainy. In passing any considerable group or town, the prisoners drowned all
						shouts of exultation by the rebels with patriotic songs. The "Rally <pb id="VAB9258-119"
							n="119"/> Round the Flag" seemed to have new significance, and swelling out from a
						thousand brave throats, drowned the rebel shouts and yells. Never were the rallying
						songs of the Nation more appropriately used, nor with greater effect, in impressing upon
						traitors an idea of the moral force of the Union, and its inevitable triumph.</p>
					<p>The Rev. Hamilton Robb, chaplain of the Forty-sixth, a man of seventy years, made this
						dreadful march, a prisoner. He was not released until June, and was held until then in
						violation of the universal custom of all civilized nations.</p>
					<p>Previous to the arrival of the prisoners of the Red river campaign, Camp Ford had been
						occupied by about 800 men and officers, including 150 officers and sailors captured at
						various points on the coast of Texas.</p>
					<p>In April, 1864, these men were almost destitute of clothing. Many, when captured, were
						robbed of all articles not absolutely necessary to cover them. They had passed one of
						the coldest winters known in Texas in that destitute condition. More than three-fourths
						of the men had no shoes, for months. In December, they had marched to Shreveport, a
						distance of 140 miles, and back in January, through rain, snow and sleet, and over icy
						roads, with no shelter at night, on rations of coarse meal and starved beef. Again, in
						March, they were driven over the same road and back. These moves, it was said, were made
						for the purpose of exchange, but they were not finally released until July. When they
						left the prison, many of them were about in the condition of Adam and Eve on the <hi
							rend="i">entree</hi> of those individuals into society.</p>
					<p>On the 20th of April, the Red river prisoners arrived at Camp Ford and were promptly
						assigned quarters.</p>
					<p>Early in May, some 1,500 officers and men, captured from General Steele, in Arkansas,
						were added to the already crowded prison pen, and, at various times, the captures from
						transports and gunboats were brought in, until the congregation reached four thousand
						eight hundred.</p>
					<p>Steele's men had been captured at Mark's Mills, Ark. Their treatment had been most
						barbarous. As soon as they had been marched to the rear, they were systematically and
						completely stripped of everything--hats, boots, coats, pants, shirts and drawers--and
						left to go naked, or put on the filthy rags thrown away by the scoundrels who robbed
						them. Their money, watches, and, in short, every article in their possession, was taken
						from them. Even the treasured pictures of their wives and mothers were taken <pb
							id="VAB9258-120" n="120"/> and made the subjects of gross, vulgar ribaldry, and then
						thrown in heaps, when the chivalry rode over them with their horses.</p>

					<p rend="center b">AT CAMP FORD.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> prison was four miles from Tyler, Smith county, Texas. It
						covered an area of about six acres, enclosed by a stockade. A trench or ditch was first
						dug around the ground selected; in it were placed, on end, oak or pine timbers, fitted
						closely together, and forming a wall about eight feet high. On the outside the earth was
						banked up so that the guards, while on their beats, could see over the camp. The
						location was on an abrupt hillside--a kind of oak and pine barrens. Every tree and shrub
						was carefully cut down, leaving nothing to protect the prisoners from the drenching
						rains, the chilling dews of night, or the scorching rays of the sun. Within this pen the
						prisoners were turned, and mockingly told to "make yourselves comfortable."</p>
					<p>The officers had the rare privilege of going to the woods to cut logs and limbs, which
						they carried in on their backs, under guard, and constructed rude and insufficient
						shelters. Thus, parties of five and ten going out, in time built up cabins, a labor not
						light, considering that there were only twenty axes and five shovels for use. These,
						among 4,800 men, were in demand. An auger and an old saw were supposed to be within the
						stockade, but could never be found.</p>
					<p>The men, with the greatest difficulty, with an armful of brush brought in one day, and
						some twigs the next, sought to erect shelters to protect them from the sun. Parties of
						from ten to twenty were successively passed out, under guard, with an old ax or two. A
						short time was allowed them to procure this class of material, but so great was the
						clamor and eager rush for the prison gate, that, in their ill-humor, the officers in
						charge for days would allow none to go out. Hundreds of the men dug trenches in the
						hillsides, and from two to four lived in each, like wild animals. The rain ran through
						the thin covering of earth and made their only shelter untenable, even for swine.
						Others, with no enterprise, made no attempts to shelter themselves, and, consequently,
						soon became sick from exposure. Many of those unfortunates died, and many became
						cripples for life.</p>
					<p>To add to the misery of living in such hovels, this was one of the wettest seasons
						Texas had had for twenty years. During <pb id="VAB9258-121" n="121"/> the entire months
						of May and June, and far into July, rain fell almost constantly, literally in
						torrents--floods overhead and cataracts under foot. With blankets, only in proportion of
						ten men to one--robbed of clothing, in many cases, these unfortunate men were compelled,
						almost naked, to endure the drenching rains day and night. What though rain should
						cease, the dark gloom of a cheerless night, like some demon, would spread its
						impenetrable vale over the camp, and exaggerate, if possible, the misery of the
						sufferers. They did not freeze, but they shivered in every muscle. The body did not
						become numb, but there was an uneasy, unsatisfied craving for warmth, that seemed worse
						than a positively colder degree. And with this misery came memories of home to intensify
						the suffering.</p>
					<p>The ragged, haggard, care-worn men, huddled together like sheep, as if to kindle a
						little warmth by contact, and move the blood that seemed fast ceasing to flow. So, night
						after night of sleepless wretchedness passed, with no hope of comfort in the coming morn
						except the warming influences of day.</p>
					<p>Many of the prisoners were recruits, on their first campaign, and unaccustomed to the
						exposure of even ordinary camp life. Upon these the trial soon began to tell, and each
						night there was witnessed the death of some unfortunate breathing out his life in
						darkness. Lying in the mud, with the rain falling upon him, he became insensible to the
						loud thunder and the vivid lightning, and was beyond the reach of those who tortured
						him.</p>


					<p rend="center b">LIFE INSIDE.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> inside of a rebel prison camp cannot, like many other things, be
						imagined. It must be lived--seen, felt--to be comprehended. Fancy and imagination, in
						most cases, can bring to view scenes of beauty or pictures of terror, but the degree of
						wretchedness in real prison life, such as the rebel government systematically imposed on
						its prisoners of war, was too extremely brutal and unusual to be appreciated outside of
						their infernal boundaries. Such suffering was only known in Confederate prison
						pens--nowhere else. The pen or tongue is inadequate to paint or group in one idea the
						multiplied sources of annoyance, pain and horror that had their rise in the prisons of
						the rebels for Union soldiers. They contained a multitude of ragged, dispirited men,
						covered with filth, and anxious only about the <pb id="VAB9258-122" n="122"/> most
						ordinary and primary necessities of life. Reckless, regardless of everything except what
						pertained to their own immediate personal existence; shivering with the cold at night
						and scorched with the sun in daytime; without hats to protect the head or clothes to
						cover the body, the elements had uninterrupted influence upon them, and they became the
						fruitful sources of disease and death.</p>
					<p>Through the main street of Camp Ford, the larger portion of the prisoners passed for
						water, and Broadway never presented a more busy scene of barter and traffic than there
						appeared. Nor did any broker's board ever present so much intenseness as was exhibited
						by the prisoners and outsiders in commercial operations. Here was brought the product of
						the surrounding country for sale, at fabulous prices. Flour at $500 a barrel! There was
						no sign of shame on the face of the slave-driver, when he demanded from the reeling,
						exhausted prisoner forty dollars for a chicken. Melons sold at ten dollars, and that
						when they were rotting, in super abundance.</p>
					<p>Trading stands were erected along the main street of the pen. Wholesale and retail
						merchants operated in divers departments, and all diving into the pockets of the
						prisoners. Tobacco was the great staple article. Everybody wanted it--few could get it.
						Men would barter their only shirt for it, and it was said the old repudiated quids were
						worked over and again made do duty. Whisky was sometimes introduced by a guard or an
						outsider. What was called a "drink," about a quarter of a gill, cost a dollar. The
						prisoners made rings of bone, gutta percha, wood, etc., and sold them to outsiders, at
						strong prices. Turning lathes were set up and fancy work, principally chessmen, turned
						out, and sold at paying prices. Combs, violins, earthenware, and many other articles
						were manufactured, and in good style, too, and disposed of at remunerating prices. Many
						other articles were made in a superior manner, and sold.</p>
					<p>A crockery manufacturer got up several canteens, made of clay, which were in much
						demand among the rebel soldiers. He cast them over a tin one, and tore up a pair of old
						blue pants for covers. The cloth and the strips of an old shirt, for straps, were well
						washed, and the clay canteens, with an old teapot spout for a neck, looked, as they hung
						in front of his quarters, like a first rate article, and perfectly new. It was not long
						before a squad of rebel soldiers passed through, and were attracted by the canteens, and
						the entire stock was sold at extra figures. Three months after, some of the <pb
							id="VAB9258-123" n="123"/> same squad sauntered through the same quarters, and
						innocently inquired for canteens. Remembering his customers, the prisoner said he had
						none--that he never had any canteens. One of the rebels said that they wanted a d----d
						Yankee who sold them some canteens as they passed up. They were clay only, and when they
						put water in them, they just melted.</p>

					<p>After being imposed upon in trading, a portion of the guard sought their revenge by
						persuading some of the men to come to a forbidden line and trade. When they went out to
						the line, and displayed their goods, they were seized by the rebels and robbed of all
						they had. The prisoners dared not resist, for they were in a position which would have
						warranted the guard in shooting them, so they had to submit.</p>
					<p>But it was not long before the prisoners squared accounts with the rebels. When the
						affair seemed to be forgotten, they were invited in one night to trade. This was
						forbidden by the rules,. but the extreme anxiety of the rebels to trade overcame their
						caution and induced them to venture. As soon as the business had arrived at an
						interesting stage, the rebels were seized, their pistols taken, and they were robbed of
						every movable article about. them. Their situation obliged them to submit.</p>
					<p>Exciting and amusing scenes occurred. When a wagon loaded with produce entered the camp
						a dense crowd would gather around. it. A multitude of purchasers would so confuse the
						vender that all consciousness would be lost, and his stuff would go without a.
						consideration.</p>
					<p>On one occasion a pompous old planter came in with a wagon load of produce, driven by a
						negro. A few hundred men surrounded the wagon, and made offers to purchase. In the
						meantime the linchpins were removed, and the wheels slipped to the ends of the spindles.
						The hame-strings were untied and the harness generally loosened. About that time the
						planter begun to suspect something wrong, and ordered his negro to drive out quick. Jube
						cracked his whip, and, lo! a general catastrophe ensued. The mules slipped from the
						harness, the wheels rolled off and the wagon, planter, produce and negro experienced
						sudden emancipation. The old gentleman felt a dozen hands in his pockets, which quickly
						relieved him of everything. He lost all his produce, his money, his hat, harness (for it
						was valuable material) and most of his clothes, while his negro was carried off to the
						quarters on the shoulders of the men.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-124" n="124"/>

					<p>This "outrage" called forth the severest denunciations from the authorities, but, on
						investigation, it appearing that nobody did it, there was no punishment.</p>

					<p rend="center b">ESCAPES.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HOUGH</hi> the prison was heavily guarded, escapes and attempts were of
						nightly occurrence. During the month of March, a party projected and completed a tunnel.
						It commenced inside of one of the cabins, and extended out 150 yards beyond the
						stockade; but just as all was ready for a general rush, the stockade was extended for
						the accommodation of more prisoners, and the plan was frustrated. This tunnel,
						afterward, furnished a good place for prisoners to hide in when contemplating an escape.
						They would enter and remain until the pursuit of them outside was given up, when they
						would go in earnest. Several tunnels were constructed, but none were ever made available
						for their original purpose. One large one was within fifteen feet of completion in
						March, 1864, when the last but one of the prisoners of the Forty-sixth come out. It was
						reported abandoned. This tunnel cost an immense amount of labor. A shaft six feet deep
						was sunk in a cabin. The tunnel was then started toward a bank outside, about 170 feet
						distant. The chamber was two feet wide by three feet high. Air holes were opened above,
						under a bunk or a bed, through which the miners got breath. The tools used were
						case-knives; a sled, upon which the earth was drawn out in buckets, and ropes made from
						cows' tails. A station would be established midway, to which the sled would be hauled by
						a stationary Yankee engine. The bucket would then be put on another sled and hauled to
						the shaft. The first sled would, at the same time, return to the work, bearing another
						bucket. The earth was spread under bunks, or in holes about the camp, and covered up
						before daylight. There was a traitor among the prisoners, at last discovered to be one
						Hawkins, of the One Hundred and Twentieth Ohio. On discovery, he was removed outside,
						and lived about the officers' quarters, and worked for them at tailoring. On coming up
						the river, in March, 1864, this gentleman was thrown overboard, but was saved by the
						deck hands, who were not posted.</p>
					<p>Nearly every movement in the pen was known to the guards, and great caution was
						observed in working on tunnels. None except a select few knew anything about it. Rebel
						officers would come <pb id="VAB9258-125" n="125"/> in and make a general and thorough
						examination, looking especially for tunnels, of which they evidently knew something.
						Ramrods and swords were run into the earth, but no discoveries were made. The "Grand
						Trunk" laid too deep.</p>
					<p>The digging of the large tunnel cost an immense amount of risk and labor. On one part
						of the line the excavation had to be made fifty feet without ventilation--almost
						suffocating those engaged in it.</p>
					<p>A pack of trained hounds was constantly kept for the purpose of tracking and hunting
						down fugitives from the pen, and these were under the charge of a professional negro
						hunter. When a prisoner was missed, these dogs were made to take the circuit of the camp
						until the track was discovered, which they would follow, through woods and swamps, and
						almost invariably overtake the exhausted man.</p>
					<p>Music was often resorted to, to beguile the watchful guards while a party was
						meditating an escape. Attention would be attracted by a good song, while a log would be
						dug up out of the stockade, and a party prepared for the venture were getting out.
						Others, more venturesome or desperate, would draw themselves to the top while the
						sentinel's back was turned, and quietly let themselves down on the outside.</p>
					<p>Hundreds who had secreted their money, bribed guards to connive at their escape.
						Sometimes as many as twenty of a night went out in that way. The market price for such
						favors was five dollars in greenbacks. Such contracts were made with men professing
						Union sentiments, and who would, for money, take such risks.</p>
					<p>But very few of those who got out of prison escaped. It was rare one overcame all the
						dangers from dogs, rebels, deep rivers, swamps, hunger, and the many difficulties that
						beset the way to the Federal lines. In from two to ten days the fugitive would be
						brought back and reconsigned to the pen.</p>
					<p>It was seldom the officers discovered the absence of a man escaping, until his friends
						made it known or he was recaptured. Keeping his escape a secret gave the man a start of
						the hounds and cavalry, and it gave the camp an extra ration.</p>
					<p>It frequently occurred that when a soldier died a sailor would exchange clothes with
						the deceased, and remove the body to his quarters. The sailor would assume his name, get
						his rations and a chance for exchange or parol--a privilege not possessed by <pb
							id="VAB9258-126" n="126"/> sailors. Of the numbers getting out, it is safe to say that
						not over one in fifty finally escaped. The others were overtaken and brought back, to
						suffer severe penalties for their effort.</p>
					<p>The nearest point in the Federal lines was at Vicksburg, a distance of 300 miles. There
						was not a county in the States west of the Mississippi, within the Confederate lines,
						but what had a party of mounted soldiers, with a leash of trained bloodhounds, hunting
						deserters and conscripts. At least one-half of the population was actively disloyal, and
						bore an intense hatred to Federal soldiers. An escape might well be considered a
						miracle. Most of those attempting to escape, started with little or no preparation. They
						were ignorant of the geography of the country, and without maps or charts. Many knew
						nothing about traveling at night, and were unaccustomed to traveling in forests. Their
						appearance would betray them to the first man they met. After a few days of bewildered
						wandering, exhausted by hunger and fatigue, many would be willing to barter their
						freedom for corn-bread, and give themselves up, or, more probably, be overtaken by men
						and hounds, and driven back. Frequently men would travel hard all night, and by the
						first dawn of daylight see the prison from which they had escaped six or eight hours
						before. Many cases occurred where men had reached the Mississippi and were recaptured
						while hailing a gunboat or transport. Others, within sight of a Federal picket, would be
						taken by some straggling vagabond and delivered up.</p>
					<p>Much ingenuity was required and used to conceal the escape of a prisoner by his
						comrades. Every morning there was a general roll-call. The camp was divided into
						sections of from 100 to 200 men. A rebel sergeant had a roll of these, and it was his
						duty to call the list and ascertain the presence or absence of every man. The prisoners
						were formed in two ranks, and two sentinels, with muskets and bayonets, passed along the
						front and rear of the line as the roll-call was called. With all this precaution, the
						absent ones were duly answered for without discovery. Frequently the sergeant, whose
						duty it was to call the roll, was not able to read the names without spelling, when some
						considerate Yankee would volunteer to assist him, and would inadvertently miss the name
						of an absconding party. By universal consent, the party covering up the absence of a
						friend was entitled to the surplus ration. With the officers there was more difficulty.
						They were carried on a separate roll, but they were so successful that the name of an
							<pb id="VAB9258-127" n="127"/> absentee was often carried a month without
						discovery--long enough to insure his safety.</p>

					<p rend="center b">GENERAL TREATMENT.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> commanding officer of Camp Ford, Lieutenant Colonel Borders, was
						an Englishman, a resident of the South about nine years. From association with the most
						reckless and dissipated of this semi-barbarous society, he was thoroughly imbued with
						its worst qualities. By marriage he had stepped into a fortune, and had become arrogant
						and haughty. Here the innate brutality of the man found full scope and a field for
						cultivation. The possession of power fed his pride and sharpened his malice. With all,
						the infamy of his character was intensified by his being a bitter rebel. A monarchist,
						hating everything republican, and with unbounded vindictiveness toward Federal soldiers,
						he was a fit instrument to carry out the system provided by the leaders of the rebellion
						in the treatment of prisoners. He had an adjutant, unprincipled, cowardly, vicious and
						destitute of the dimmest spark of manhood. This officer's name was Lieutenant McCann. He
						had no principle of action but the slavish one of wishing to please his superiors. When
						some of the prisoners were coming home through New Orleans, McCann was just being
						brought in a prisoner. General Canby was informed of the brutality practiced by him by
						Major Norris, of the Forty-third Indiana, when the scoundrel was put in irons, and a
						ration of a pint of meal a day, with a half pound of bacon, ordered him.</p>
					<p>If men approached too near the stockade--the limit being ten feet--they were either
						shot down or made to mark time at a vigorous "double-quick," at the pleasure and
						discretion of the sentinel. As many of these were boys, not over fifteen years old, it
						was very gratifying to the embryo traitor to have a Yankee dance at his bidding. The
						inducement, a cocked musket, held at the breast of the prisoner and handled in the most
						reckless manner, was generally sufficient to get out of a man all the dance there was in
						him. As many as thirty at a time have been subjected to this treatment for two hours, or
						until they became exhausted and fell. Confederate officers often stood by, enjoying the
						scene and suggesting a bayonet to enliven the performance.</p>
					<p>Men who were overtaken in trying to escape, and returned to prison, were made to stand
						on stumps or blocks of wood, bareheaded, <pb id="VAB9258-128" n="128"/> in the sun for
						four hours, and after two hours off, then again on for four hours. This, in some cases,
						was continued for a week.</p>
					<p>Lady visitors sometimes visited the prison, and seemed to enjoy the misery they
						witnessed.</p>
					<p>Groups of prisoners were tied up by the thumbs for some trifling offense, and suspended
						so that their toes barely touched the ground, and for days were brought out and
						subjected to this torture, two hours at a time. Strong men subjected to this punishment,
						under a July sun, would faint and fall as far as the ligatures would allow, and would be
						cut down as soon as a lazy, vicious rebel found it convenient to go to their
						assistance.</p>
					<p>Prisoners were shot down without any attempt at justification. A man was near the gate,
						asking permission to go out for wood. The guard ordered him to go away. The man turned
						to obey, when the guard deliberately shot him through the heart.</p>
					<p>A man named Colvert, of the Seventy-seventh Ohio, while quietly walking within the
						proper limits, was inhumanly shot down by a boy fourteen years of age, who was, perhaps,
						ambitious of something to boast of among his associates and tutors.</p>
					<p>S. O. Shoenicker, of the One Hundred and Thirtieth Illinois, while sitting in his hut
						pleading with a friend to become religious, was shot dead by a guard, twenty yards
						behind him. The guard explained that he had a brother killed in battle, and said, "I was
						bound to kill some d----d Yankee for it." As a punishment for the outrage, the boy
						received a furlough for thirty days.</p>
					<p>A member of the One Hundred and Seventy-third New York was killed while walking towards
						the fence to obtain his hat, which had blown off. The man who did this act merely
						remarked, "That's three."</p>
					<p>A member of the Thirty-sixth Iowa was shot while walking along the usual path, early in
						the evening. Both arms were broken, and the heart was perforated by the ball. He fell in
						the arms of his brother, and the brutal murderer was not even chided for his deed.</p>
					<p>An Indian, belonging to the Fourteenth Kansas, was killed as wantonly as any of those
						mentioned.</p>
					<p>The men who committed these outrages belonged to Colonels Sweet and Brown's
						battalions.</p>
					<p>Barbarous as the treatment of these prisoners was, it was no exception to the rule of
						treatment of prisoners by the rebels in <pb id="VAB9258-129" n="129"/> authority. It was
						not the result of an isolated case of the appointment of a brute, without a single
						instinct of humanity in his breast, by mistake, as prison commandant, but was the result
						of a hellish design conceived and put in force by "Jeff" Davis and his co-conspirators.
						The orders of those highest in authority were simply carried out by those in immediate
						charge of the pens. The contrast between the treatment of these unfortunate men and all
						others who fell into rebel hands with the treatment of rebels who were fortunate or
						unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the Union forces, will always be the
						brightest page of American history. The rebels who were in the Union prisons were well
						fed and warmly clad and housed, with the best medical attendance, and all that could be
						desired except their liberty.</p>

					<p rend="center b">RATIONS AND HOSPITAL.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> regular ration consisted of a pint of corn meal, in the bran,
						and about a pound of beef, with a little salt, for each man; but a full ration, even by
						this standard, was never seen. The articles received were of the most inferior quality.
						The meat was often unfit for use. The supply of cooking utensils was not sufficient for
						a fourth of those who required them. A small allowance of wood was brought in, but so
						meager was the supply, that a large portion of the men would have none. Those having no
						way to cook their beef lost it. Provisions could be bought of outsiders, but the prices
						put them beyond the reach of nearly all. How some of the boys wished for a supply of
						"Northern Indiana railroad" money! The officers of the camp permitted every advantage to
						be taken of the starving inmates, and seemed to co-operate in creating a demand for what
						there was to sell.</p>
					<p>The hospital was a new wooden building erected in the woods near by. It was large
						enough for thirty patients, which was about one-third of the average sick requiring
						treatment. Sick men were usually carried out to the hospital only when it became
						apparent that death would soon ensue. In the hospital, the sick were put on rude wooden
						bunks, with nothing to smooth or soften them. No blankets or comforts of any kind were
						furnished. The only advantage in the hospital, over the camp, was that the men were
						raised off the ground--a gain of dryness, at the expense of comfort. The same rations
						were issued to sick and well. If a sick man had a blanket, he was fortunate; but if he
						had none, he <pb id="VAB9258-130" n="130"/> was obliged to suffer without it. The
						majority laid almost naked, on the bare boards, and were left to get well or die, as the
						disease or their constitution determined.</p>
					<p>The medical department was in keeping with all else. A surgeon was detailed, whose duty
						it was to visit the sick. He usually visited the camp about once a week, and pretended
						to have an inspection, but usually he came at such times as few only knew of of his
						presence. When he was seen, he issued curses liberally, and common, dirty drugs most
						sparingly. The monthly allowance of medicines to camp was not sufficient for one day's
						treatment of the more simple cases. In short, the whole thing was a brutal and
						systematic plan to compel men to die.</p>

					<p rend="center b">REMOVAL TO CAMP GROCE.</p>

					<p>O<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the 12th of August, 506 of the prisoners were ordered to Camp
						Groce, a distance of 200 miles south. The unfortunate ones were taken from every
						regiment in the camp, and made up of the unruly members of the prison community.
						Officers and men who had made themselves obnoxious to the authorities by resisting or
						protesting against their treatment as prisoners of war, and those who had made attempts
						to escape, were selected to make up this detachment.</p>
					<p>Not over ten minutes' notice was given of the proposed march. The rations of the day
						had not been issued, and there was nothing to be taken to eat. Rations, it was said,
						would follow in wagons. The line was soon formed outside, but the march was delayed many
						hours, while the men were kept in the burning sun, without water, wearying with a delay
						that seemed without cause, except for the purpose of torturing them. John Shaffer,
						Jasper N. Mullins, Robert Lewis and David Garbison, of the Forty-sixth, being sick, were
						not taken, though called out. The road, for the entire distance, ran through a pine and
						oak barren, extremely broken, and interspersed with narrow strips of timber, with an
						occasional stretch of from five to six miles of desert, without a shrub or scarcely a
						blade of grass. The sand was scorching hot and ankle deep, and with the greatest
						scarcity of water. Fifteen miles frequently intervened between watering places. When
						water was reached it was scarce. The guards had to be served first, then the horses, and
						then the men could try for it. There were not over fifty canteens in the lot, and no way
						of carrying water. <pb id="VAB9258-131" n="131"/> In justice to the guards on this
						excursion, it should be said that they were the best class yet met. They belonged to the
						Twenty-first Texas, and numbered 250. The intense heat, without water, caused many of
						the prisoners to drop by the roadside, where they were guarded until night came, and
						then were obliged to overtake the column. There were six or eight wagons assigned for
						the sick and exhausted, but they did not accommodate one-fourth of the number of those
						utterly unable to march. Many were without shirts, their naked backs blistered by the
						sun. A large proportion were without shoes, their feet burning in the hot sand. Many
						were with uncovered heads, exposed to the almost perpendicular rays of the sun. It would
						be fruitless to attempt to portray the horrors of that distressing march. Those who made
						it will never forget it.</p>
					<p>Camp Groce was at last made, when the saddest days in the prisoners' experience
						commenced. There were confined in this camp about fifty soldiers, and the officers and
						crews of the "Wave" and "Granite City," captured at Calcasieu Pass, on the 6th of May,
						1864--in all, about 150 men. They were all sick with fever and ague. Of these, eighty
						died before November. The living were in the most destitute condition.</p>
					<p>This prison was fifty-one miles above Houston, on the Houston &amp; Texas Central
						railroad, and two miles from the town of Hempstead. It was situated in a sharp bend and
						within a few miles of the Brazos river. It was almost entirely surrounded by a strip of
						low, marshy ground, impregnating the air with a deadly malaria. About one and a half
						acres of ground were inclosed with a tight stockade some twelve feet high. The prison
						was supplied with water from two wells, which were found filled with rubbish and filth.
						These, with great labor, were fitted for use, and furnished a supply of slimy and
						unhealthy water. There were board barracks, sufficient to accomodate 650 men, but in a
						most dilapidated condition.</p>
					<p>The rations of this camp when the new delegation arrived, were some better than in the
						one just left, but they were soon contracted to uncomfortable proportions. This camp was
						commanded by an Irish captain, who had been a corporal in the regular army, and was in
						Texas at the breaking out of the rebellion, when the infamous Twiggs so disgracefully
						betrayed his trust, and gave up his command of trained soldiers to a cowardly mob. Of
						the companies of the prison guards, one was Irish, one German, and two <pb
							id="VAB9258-132" n="132"/> were Texans. The men of the two first were, almost to a
						man, loyal. They showed the prisoners every possible favor and kindness, when not under
						the eye of their officers. Numerous instances occurred when the guards, after dark,
						passed out prisoners, and even by ropes, let prisoners down on the outside, and
						furnished them rations for their journey. As many as thirty, in rapid succession, have
						gone over the stockade on a moonlight night, either by the help of the guard, or through
						their disregard of duty. These attempts to escape were no more successful than at Camp
						Ford. After wandering about the country a few days, the fugitives were brought back,
						having become sick and given themselves up, or were captured by the local force. Some,
						doubtless, died in the wilderness.</p>
					<p>The men transferred from Camp Ford had not been long in their new quarters before they
						were, many of them, taken down with fevers, and by the middle of September, there were
						not 100 well men in the camp. The prison presented a most deplorable spectacle. Men
						crazed with fever ran hither and thither, like mad men. Night and day the cries of the
						sick filled the air. Men awakened in the morning, after a night of horror, to find their
						bunk-mates dead by their side. No medicines were to be had until disease had become
						general in the camp, and many were beyond the reach of any remedy. The surgeon whose
						duty it was to visit the sick seldom came, and when he did he was drunk, and distributed
						curses instead of medicine. Many days would pass before any medical attendance or
						relief, beyond what could be furnished by the prisoners, could be had. This hideous
						drama was most appropriately closed by the death of the fiendish surgeon with delirium
						tremens.</p>
					<p>After this, those who were thought too sick to be treated in camp, were taken to the
						hospital at Hempstead. From ten to fifteen sick men would be jammed into a wagon and
						carried to the hospital, over rough roads, and through the scorching sun. Four men died
						during these murderous transits, and were rattled along with their suffering comrades to
						town.</p>

					<p rend="center b">THE HOSPITAL AT HEMPSTEAD.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> institution was the low garret of a church. The roof was almost
						within reach of the patients. There was no side window--no place for ventilation except
						the small gable windows. <pb id="VAB9258-133" n="133"/> The inner view of this den was
						most horrible. There was only enough light to make the scene visible, and the filthy and
						noisome effluvia that pervaded the place, drove away all who were not compelled to
						remain. The fresh air, so greatly needed by the fevered sufferers, seemed to turn in
						disgust and abhorrence from the threshhold of this cavern.</p>
					<p>The sick were crowded together as thick as it was possible to wedge them--one tier over
						another, on rough boards, and generally with no mattress or straw. If a man had no
						blanket, which was generally the case, he laid in his rags on the hard boards. There
						were a few mattresses belonging to the Confederacy, but these, from long use, had become
						so foul that they were refused by all. Helpless and without assistance, the sick were
						compelled to disregard all considerations of cleanliness.</p>

					<p rend="center b">CHANGE OF CAMP.</p>

					<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> September the yellow fever broke out at Galveston, and soon
						reached Houston and other points north. The Confederate guard at the prison, fearing the
						disease might reach the camp, openly threatened to leave and let the prisoners take care
						of themselves. On this the authorities determined to move the camp. On the 20th the
						prisoners were taken west of the Brazos river and encamped twenty-five miles from the
						railroad, on a low, wet, marshy creek bottom.</p>
					<p>There were now only 500 of the original 650 men left. Of these only seventy-five were
						well. On the journey the sick were crowded together in rough wagons, fifteen to a load.
						Only those who were not able to walk were allowed to ride. Those whom the bayonet could
						persuade along were obliged to march on foot. Very few were able to make each day's
						march with any comfort, but they had to go or suffer constant insult and abuse. The
						transportation was limited, and many dragged themselves along until they could do so no
						longer, when they fell exhausted and were left to follow when they could, or be picked
						up when it suited the guard to go back for them. On this move six men died in the
						wagons, and were hastily tumbled into holes dug by the wayside.</p>
					<p>At this camp, sick and well alike had no beds but the damp ground, and no shelter but
						such as they could construct with brush. They were closely packed on less than half an
						acre of ground, where the cooking and living was done. Sinks were dug inside <pb
							id="VAB9258-134" n="134"/> the lines, which in the hot sun became unendurable. Water
						was. obtained from pools along the bed of the creek--green, filthy and rank with disease
						and death. As usual, above the camp the horses. of the rebels, numbering nearly 500,
						were kept, watered and cleaned. The dirt of a filthy rebel camp was intentionally thrown
						into the water. On the banks of the stream were the sinks of the rebels. The rains
						brought down all this disgusting material, and left the prisoners no alternative but to
						use that water or none.</p>
					<p>The sickness rapidly increased. The medical appliances were less plenty than at the
						other pens. Each morning roll-call found men present in body but absent in spirit. Death
						had released them. The dead would be found lying upon the ground in the mud, having been
						denied the satisfaction of a bed, and with no covering except the miserable rags forming
						their dress. Around these would be set a guard--a formality meant to be considered
						respectful, but, under the circumstances, an insult.</p>

					<p rend="center b">ANOTHER MOVE.</p>

					<p>O<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the 3d of October, owing to heavy rains and cold winds, it was
						decreed again to move the camp. A march of twenty-five miles was made to an old camp
						meeting ground, near the town of Chappel Hill, where were some sheds and shelter, upon
						which the encampment was formed. The move from the old camp was much like the former
						marches, rendered worse by a more general and thorough exhaustion of the men. Now, a
						well man was a curiosity--none were well. As before, several died on the wagons or by
						the roadside.</p>
					<p>The new camp was also located on a piece of wet ground. There was a springy ridge above
						it, which kept the pen constantly damp. As before, there was no shelter for the
						prisoners, and they had the ground only for a bed. The cold rains of October had now set
						in, and night after night the camp resounded with the piteous moans of the sick and
						suffering, aggravated by the distressing cough, which never ceased. Ghostly forms
						crowded around scanty fires, striving to warm their attenuated bodies, and keep in
						circulation the sluggish blood. And this experience ran through many nights of rain and
						wind.</p>
					<p>About the 15th of October, for the first time, the prison was furnished with better
						medicines, but still far from a sufficiency. A surgeon, comparatively a humane man,
						abounding in good <pb id="VAB9258-135" n="135"/> promises, of limited action and energy,
						was allotted to the prison. Health began to improve, but the death rate was four or five
						per day. There was abundant shelter for 2,000 men, consisting of sheds and board houses,
						erected by and for the families who came there for religious purposes, in times past. In
						these were quartered about 400 soldiers--the guard; the rest was taken up by the horses,
						equipments and forage. The established system to wear out and destroy the prisoners
						would have been defeated in a measure, had they been allowed to have occupied the sheds
						that were empty. About the last of October, the yellow fever having subsided, the
						prisoners were moved back to Camp Groce. On this journey, after having tramped over 400
						miles from the place of capture, the first railroad transportation of the campaign was
						furnished the prisoners, and a ride of fifteen miles enjoyed by them.</p>
					<p>The condition of the men on their return to Camp Groce was most deplorable. There were
						440 of the original number. With the exception of six successful escapes, all the rest
						had fallen victims of the infamous treatment to which they had been subjected by the
						scoundrels who had them in charge. Not one in ten of the prisoners had a hat, about one
						in twenty a blanket, a few had shirts, a few pantaloons, but the majority were clothed
						in collections of rags that defied description. Only a few had shoes.</p>
					<p>What are known as "northers," now frequently occurred. Their suddenness rendered them
						more severe. Often, with the thermometer at seventy, dark clouds would start up in the
						northwest, and in one or two hours the temperature would fall to thirty-five. As the
						season advanced, these storms increased in frequency and intensity, and they were more
						effective on the prisoners than a regular spell of colder weather. The general misery of
						the prisoners was greatly augmented by their inability to hear from home, or in any way
						to obtain information in relation to the progress of the war. Nothing was known about
						the great armies of the Nation--of their condition or progress. The exaggerated stories
						of the rebels were known to be false, because unreasonable and improbable. It was known
						that the Red river expedition was a disastrous failure, and it was feared that similar
						defeats had been suffered in other departments.</p>
					<p>Nothing had been heard of the Forty-sixth regiment but what was contained in a short
						letter from Colonel Bringhurst, written about June 14th, while on the Mississippi, to
						Colonel Flory. At the time, the regiment was going home on "veteran furlough." <pb
							id="VAB9258-136" n="136"/> At Camp Ford, in November, a letter was received from
						Colonel B., by the four members of the regiment then remaining. It informed them that
						the regiment was in Kentucky. With these exceptions, nothing was known of the comrades
						of the prisoners, with whom they had been constantly in company, in camp or field, for
						nearly three years. The Houston <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> was the vehicle of news
						received by the neighborhood about Camp Groce. In it were published the most startling
						accounts of Federal defeats and rebel victories. Every action was a Federal disaster,
						and ruin seemed constantly impending over the Nation. With all this, there ran through
						the rebel soldiery an anticipation of defeat, which belied all their boasts and
						predictions.</p>
					<p>At Camp Ford, on the 4th of July, the commandant permitted the prisoners to celebrate
						the day, with the condition that no reference was to be made to the war, or to the
						questions at issue between the North and the South, in speeches. Colonel Dugane, of the
						Seventy-fifth New York; Colonel Flory, of the Forty-sixth Indiana, and Captain Crocker,
						of the gunboat <hi rend="i">Clifton</hi>, and others, made patriotic speeches, which
						were highly appreciated by the large audience. Patriotic songs were sung, and over 300
						sat down to dinner, at the aristocratic price of four dollars a ticket.</p>
					<p>On the 8th of November, the Camp Ford prisoners held an election for President of the
						United States. The matter was first suggested by the rebel commandant, Colonel Brown. He
						said the votes of men coming from so many States would indicate the result in the actual
						vote. The idea was readily adopted by the prisoners, and preparations made for the
						important occasion. The camp was divided into wards, and persons indicated distributed
						slips of paper in each. At roll-call, on the morning of the 8th, the tickets were
						dropped into hats, brought together, and counted. The proceeding was altogether fair.
						There was no bribery nor undue influence used. The count showed 615 votes for General
						McClellan and 1,665 for Mr. Lincoln. To make the affair more real, several fights came
						off, with the usual amount of damage to the participants. Colonel Brown was astonished
						at the result. He had predicted another result, now he declared that Mr. Lincoln would
						be re-elected, and admitted the probable collapse of the Confederacy. He bought three
						gallons of whisky, and, with his officers, got gloriously drunk over the
						"indication."</p>
					<p>On the 15th of December, 342 men and officers, including all of the Forty-sixth
						present, were notified that they were to be <pb id="VAB9258-137" n="137"/> paroled and
						to proceed to New Orleans, by way of Houston and Galveston, immediately. It did not take
						long to prepare for that move.</p>
					<p>The paroled men were conveyed to Galveston by railroad, where they were detained only a
						few hours, as a steamer was awaiting them. With some of the rebel guards, who were as
						anxious to get away, the late prisoners were soon happy and safe under the stars and
						stripes. In thirty-six hours the party was landed on the New Orleans levee, and felt
						that the sufferings of so many weary months were over.</p>
					<p>During the voyage across the gulf, John Cunningham, of the Forty-sixth, died and was
						buried at sea. Joseph Davis, of the Forty-sixth, died in the hospital shortly after
						reaching New Orleans. After living through so much, thus to die almost in sight of
						home!</p>
					<p>Of this regiment, John Meredith died at Camp Ford, Jacob Oliver at Hempstead, and
						Robert Lewis and George Lane at Camp Groce. Thomas S. Evans died on the plains, in
						endeavoring to escape. Information was brought from Camp Ford, by Jasper N. Mullins, who
						left there in March. There were then 1,500 Federal prisoners there, among them Daniel
						Garbinson, the only representative of the Forty-sixth.</p>
					<p>At Shreveport, among others of different regiments, were John Shaffer, Alexander Reed
						and William Bacome. The two latter had escaped from Camp Groce, were retaken, and taken
						to Shreveport. Mullins escaped from Camp Ford by taking the place of Enoch O'Brien, of
						the Forty-third Indiana. That regiment was called out for parole, and as O'Brien's
						death, which had occurred a month before, was undiscovered, Mullins answered to the name
						and was paroled.</p>
					<p>On the 13th of November, Lieutenant Colonel Flory, of the Forty-sixth, and Captain W.
						B. Loring, of the United States Navy, left the prison at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. It
						was the custom of the prison commandant to give passes each day to Federal officers to
						pass out on parole, not to escape. On this occasion, a pass was written by one of these
						officers, who put the commandant's name to it. With their blankets under their arms,
						ostensibly to collect brush, they presented themselves at the gate, showed the passes
						and went out. They had previously sent out, by friends, some provisions and rebel
						clothing, which had been deposited in an appointed place. On getting out, the officers
						went to a thicket and waited until dark, in the meantime putting on the Confederate <pb
							id="VAB9258-138" n="138"/> suits. At dark they started, and traveled as rapidly and
						steadily as possible all night. It was estimated that they made at least thirty miles
						that night, which put them beyond the hounds. The escape was discovered the next
						morning, and the cavalry and hounds immediately put on their track, but neither made
						that day the distance covered by the fugitives the night before, and the chase was given
						up. At daylight the travelers stopped "twenty minutes for breakfast," and pushed on, and
						in twenty-four hours after leaving prison, were fifty-five miles away, with twenty miles
						of swamp between them and their old abode. The prisoners were then on the head waters of
						the San Jacinto, aud in a perfect wilderness.</p>
					<p>This description of country extends a distance of 100 miles, and is without a sign of
						habitation. The region is traversed by the San Jacinto, the Trinity and the Neches
						rivers, with their numerous tributaries, and is covered with heavy timber and dense
						canebrakes, matted together with briers and other kinds of tangled growth, common to
						some parts of the South. Heavy pine forests lay across the track, hundreds of acres of
						which had fallen from the effects of fire, forming a most intricate abatis, grown up
						with an immense growth of blackberry briers, often ten feet high, and, under ordinary
						circumstances, impenetrable. The fugitives were obliged, for many rods, to cut their way
						through these jungles with a knife, and then pass into a canebrake of enormous growth,
						equally laborious and discouraging. Passing these, there would be a stream to cross,
						which must be swam, again to enter upon the same experience on the other side.</p>
					<p>Thus they traveled day by day, with food in their haversacks to tempt them, but which
						must last them at least ten days. The stock--twelve pounds of bread and two pounds of
						coffee and sugar--must hold out until the cultivated districts were reached.</p>
					<p>On the 20th they crossed the Neches river, quite a large stream. Heavy rains having
						fallen for two days, the country was flooded, and all the streams were full. Owing to
						the cloudy weather, they were not able to travel for two days. With no compass, it was.
						impossible to keep the direction in a wilderness without the sun or stars. Again getting
						a glimpse of the sun, and by good guessing, the fugitives marched on. At last, food all
						gone, hungry and wet, they reached a cornfield, the limit of civilization. They at once
						filled their haversacks with corn, built a fire in the woods, and on a tin-plate cooked
						their grated corn-meal.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-139" n="139"/>

					<p>Having reached a part of the country where discovery was possible, they prepared for
						night marching. At dark they started, guided by the moon, and made the greatest possible
						distance by morning. They had water to wade, bayous to swim, and tangled canebrakes to
						penetrate. About the 25th a cold norther sprung up, and ice froze on the water.
						Struggling through this was laborious and discouraging.</p>
					<p>As the travelers approached the eastern line of Texas, which is the Sabine river, they
						became entangled in bayous, which formed a perfect network. Scarcely had they passed one
						before another was met. For two nights they marched hard without, as it was afterward
						learned, making any material advance. Coming at length to a saw-mill, they discovered a
						negro in a boat. They secreted themselves in the brush until dark, when, stealing
						cautiously up, they borrowed the boat and quietly drifted out into the bayou. When out
						of hearing, they rowed down the stream. Down this bayou the navigators rowed until 3
						o'clock in the morning, when, coming to a larger one, running south, they thought.
						themselves in the Sabine river. Crossing this, they set the boat adrift and took an
						eastern course, through a dense cypress forest. The sky being overcast with clouds, they
						had no guide for direction. After three hours' march, in daylight, they were startled by
						finding fresh tracks, and came to the conclusion that they were followed; but on
						examination they proved to be their own tracks, and they found themselves not over 200
						yards from where they landed. That day's march was made through briars and swamps. Three
						times they were compelled to build rafts, undress and swim streams, two of which were
						fully 100 yards wide, swift, and very cold. Three times that day they crossed their own
						path, it being almost impossible to keep direction--getting only an occasional glimpse
						of the sun. Night found the fugitives on a plain traveled road, which, after a good
						rest, they followed all night, wading mud and water and swimming a very wide, cold
						stream. At daylight they entered a dense wood, built a fire and parched and eat their
						last. corn.</p>
					<p>They took the road again at night, and coming to a dilapidated hut, learned from a
						woman that they had passed, during the night, the road they should have taken. A retreat
						was made, and at dark the travelers found the road, and stopped at a house for the
						night. Here the party got a good supper, bed and breakfast, and discovered, after a
						careful course of questioning, that instead of <pb id="VAB9258-140" n="140"/> being east
						of the Sabine and out of Texas, they were on the west side of that river and only five
						miles from where they set out thirty-six hours before.</p>
					<p>Early next day the river was reached, and crossed on an old table turned bottom up. Now
						there was no mistake, and the fugitives must be prepared for bold movements before
						starting. They had prepared orders with the signature of the colonel of a Texas regiment
						directing them to go to their homes near Vermillionville, Louisiana, to remount and
						refit. The order stated that their horses had died, and the men were out of clothes. It
						was now the intention to push boldly on as rebel soldiers. As such they successfully
						passed Niblet's Bluffs, went through the fortifications, eat dinner with the rebels, and
						handled the "vandal Yankees" without mercy. Here, incidentally, the travelers gathered
						all necessary information in regard to stopping places on the road.</p>
					<p>They were forty-five miles from Lake Charles, the most dangerous point on the road,
						where a number of escaped men had been recaptured and sent back. On the evening of the
						30th of November the travelers reached the city, crossed boldly over at the ferry, and
						lodged with the ferryman, at whose house was a squad of provost guards. Their papers
						were examined and pronounced good. On the morning of the 1st, they rode in the wagon of
						their host, which took them twelve miles on the road, and, with a letter of introduction
						to a friend, dismissed the travelers with his best wishes and hopes for the Confederacy.
						Traveling some twenty miles, the ferryman's friend was found, who treated the "boys from
						Vermillionville" with magnificent hospitality.</p>
					<p>On the 2d the fugitives traveled hard over a low, flat prairie, covered with water, and
						met the most dangerous adventure of the trip. A Confederate colonel, stationed at Lake
						Charles, met the fugitives on the road, and demanded their papers. They were handed over
						and closely examined. He deliberately gave it as his opinion that the men were escaped
						Yankees, and that the papers were forgeries. This insult was promptly resented in a
						becoming manner, but it required very careful management and skillful talking to
						convince the colonel that the party was truly Confederate. This was finally
						accomplished, and the chivalrous officer atoned for his unjust suspicions by adding his
						name to the papers. This made the papers good up to Vermillionville, the point
						mentioned. Approaching that town, it was deemed safer to travel by night and hide by
						day. There were Confederate troops at every <pb id="VAB9258-141" n="141"/> station and
						on the road, and the danger would be increasing as the Federal lines were approached.
						After marching the first night until 4 o'clock, a heavy rain came on. The men waited
						until daylight and discovered a wood about a mile distant. Here they determined to
						remain all day, but found the wood to be only a narrow strip of oak, with no brush, a
						house on either side not twenty rods off, and with the scene not improved by a negro
						riding from one house to the other. Being almost discovered by the negro, and most
						probably seen from one of the houses, they were forced to come out. They found an
						officer at home on leave, and two rebel soldiers on furlough. The clothes of the
						fugitives were soaking wet, and they were almost frozen, as a norther had come with
						daylight. The rebels made them welcome and gave them hot coffee and good seats at the
						fire. They remained until after dinner, and were treated with the greatest kindness. A
						rebel government wagon train, going east, was overtaken, and the travelers. rode until
						night.</p>
					<p>The fugitives passed the night of the 3d of December in the woods near Vermillionville,
						where the Forty-sixth Regiment had encamped the year before. Colonel Flory had been over
						this road several times, and remembered it. The travelers had now about eighty miles to
						the Union line, and walking by night, hiding by day, and living on parched corn, they
						made the march. They met squads of rebels on the road, but would turn off as soon as
						they would see them. They passed around the towns, and had no further trouble, reaching
						Berwick Bay on the 7th of December. A gunboat lying in the stream was hailed, but no
						boat was sent over until morning, when they were taken on board, the most completely
						overjoyed men of whom it was possible to conceive. Their Confederate rags were soon
						stripped off and suits of navy blue given them. They were once again under the stars and
						stripes, and with reverence looked on the old flag.</p>
					<p>In twenty-five days these men traveled 500 miles, swam twenty streams, pushing their
						clothes before them, on rafts; for twenty days they were in the water almost constantly,
						and for days had nothing to eat but corn.</p>
					<p>Sergeant Joseph Carr and Jacob Guess, both of Company G, of the Forty-sixth Indiana,
						escaped from the stockade at Camp Groce on the night of the 3d of September. A good
						singer of the One Hundred and Thirtieth Illinois, who frequently officiated in this
						duty, was employed in attracting the attention of the guard. <pb id="VAB9258-142"
							n="142"/> When the entertainment was at its height, the fugitives climbed the
						stockade, dropped over, and made the best possible time until daylight. At that time
						they had only twenty-five miles between them and the prison, and were clear of the
						hounds. All the next day they laid in a prairie, near a small town. The sun was very
						hot, and they obtained but little rest. They made a good march, but were much fatigued.
						On the third night they came to and crossed the San Jacinto and passed through an
						immense canebrake. On the other side was a cornfield, from which they obtained roasting
						ears. The next morning they found themselves, after a laborious rious night's march,
						surrounded by a settlement. They made a detour and were not seen. It was not safe to
						proceed, so they laid by all day, only three hundred yards from a house on either side,
						and between which negroes with dogs frequently passed. During the next night the
						fugitives came to a railroad on Trinity river. While passing a plantation house, the men
						were attacked by dogs, which alarmed and brought out the proprietor. They asked for
						water, when the man began to ask suspicious questions, which scared the travelers and
						they started on. Carr subsequently learned that this man was an ardent sympathizer with
						escaping prisoners, and would have assisted them had they remained long enough to have
						satisfied him of their character.</p>
					<p>Carr and his companion then struck a line of Union posts, fifteen, twenty and
						twenty-four miles apart, with whom they rested after their night's march. These points
						were inhabited by Union people, who often assisted Union men. At one of these places,
						the man being from home, the women directed the men where to hide, and then sent them
						food. She told them that if they would remain another day, she would prepare them a
						quantity of provisions, and send them some clothing. They remained, for both were sick
						and exhausted. The next day a friendly Irishman brought out enough clothing to make them
						comfortable, and a quantity of good provisions. They were now six days out, and Guess
						had become so sick that he was unable to proceed. He went to a neighboring house,
						acknowledged himself an escaped prisoner, and was taken back to the stockade, from
						Beaumont, on the train. Carr went on alone, traveling during the night and lying by in
						the daytime.</p>
					<p>The stations on the railroad were kept by other than Southern people. They assisted
						escaping prisoners, in nearly all cases, and directed the fugitives from place to place.
						One station beyond the <pb id="VAB9258-143" n="143"/> Sabine ended the friendly route.
						Here, when fifteen days from the prison, Carr had become very sick, and was obliged to
						halt. He had been lying out in the woods during the day and staying in a friendly house
						at night. He could not remain in the house during the day, because of the railroad
						hands. He became rapidly worse, and determined to give himself up. The man who had been
						taking care of him took him back to Beaumont on a handcar, twenty-five miles. Here, Carr
						went to a friendly house, but finding that the family could not conceal him, directed
						the proprietor to go to the military commandant and inform him of the situation. Carr
						was then arrested and taken down to Sabine City, to the hospital. He became very ill,
						and remained there four weeks, when he was promoted to the guard-house. There being a
						fleet of Federal vessels in the bay, Carr wrote, under a flag of truce, to the
						commandant, describing the condition of himself and another prisoner, and asking for
						some clothes. After some delay, a boat, under a flag, came off with a package containing
						a splendid suit of sailors' clothing for each man. The suit embraced every article
						prescribed by navy regulations. That the fit was not exact was not the fault of the
						donors. A letter accompanying the clothes, stated that the suits were the gift of the
						officers and men of the United States ship <hi rend="i">Pocahontas</hi>. Subsequently
						Carr's shoes were stolen by the guard, afterward his stockings, and finally his
						overcoat. He saved the remainder of his suit by sleeping in it.</p>
					<p>After being in the guard-house five weeks, and being perfectly recovered, Carr was sent
						back to the stockade, and created an immense sensation on his <hi rend="i">entree</hi>
						with his fine clothes.</p>
					<p>Dennis Bagley, of Company G, escaped from the stockade on the 15th of October. He took
						a wrong direction, and was seen by a negro, wading the river. The unusual circumstance
						was reported by the boy to his master, who informed some home guards, who followed and
						arrested Bagley as he was resting on a log. He was returned to the stockade the next
						day, almost before he was missed. Another opportunity offering on the night of the 16th
						of November, Bagley again went out with William Cook, of Company K of the Forty-sixth,
						and a member of the Thirty-fourth Indiana. They traveled east, and had good success
						until they came to the Sabine river, where they were seen and suspected. They were
						halted at Sibley's Bluff, where the three men arresting them went into a house. Bagley
						ran off and escaped. His comrades, unwilling to take the risk, were retained. But Bagley
						was fairly captured <pb id="VAB9258-144" n="144"/> the next day at the fatal Lake
						Charles, where he was securely locked up in prison. After six days' confinement, he was
						taken toward Alexandria. When within forty miles of the city, a dance was gotten up one
						evening at the camp fire by some Federal prisoners, and Bagley and a member of a
						Missouri regiment, taking advantage of the inattention of the guards, again slipped out.
						The escaped men traveled rapidly all night, and were not overtaken. They kept on at
						nights, and, passing near Chinaville, came along the Red river road. At one place they
						came unexpectedly upon a negro in the woods. He knew what they were, but assured them
						that he would not expose them. After getting them food, he got a horse and piloted them
						twelve miles. Subsequently, when they heard chopping in the woods, the men would go
						directly to the negroes and obtain food and advice from them.</p>
					<p>At Lake Charles, Bagley heard of Colonel Flory and his companion. The officer who had
						met them had become convinced that he had been imposed on, and that the travelers were
						"the worst kind of Yankees." He was annoyed at his own stupidity.</p>
					<p>The travelers crossed the numerous bayous on the road, and finally struck the
						Atchafalaya. The great width of the stream for a time baffled them, but after much labor
						they got over. They were now within a day's march of the Mississippi river, and began to
						be extremely anxious and fearful. On the east side of the Atchafalaya, they stopped to
						get breakfast at a house on the roadside. They passed for Confederate soldiers, and were
						invited to sit down to breakfast. The proprietor had been a heavy sufferer from Federal
						soldiers, taking every horse he had, with much other property. He waxed wroth in
						relating the outrages practiced upon him by the Yankees. The fugitives became alarmed at
						his vindictive utterances, and thought themselves discovered. The breakfast they were
						eating was rapidly disposed of, and they were glad to find themselves again on the
						outside. There was no question but what the man knew what his visitors were, and was
						only prevented from attacking them from prudential considerations. The next day,
						December 16, brought the wanderers to Morganza, where they were once more under the
						stars and stripes.</p>
					<p>In August, some thirty men of the Forty-sixth escaped from the stockade at Camp Groce.
						They scaled the walls one bright moonlight night unobserved, while a party of singers
						drew attention in another direction. After getting outside, the men separated into
						squads of two or four, and took different directions. <pb id="VAB9258-145" n="145"/> One
						of the squads was made up of William Bacome and Thomas Smith Evans. They traveled hard
						during the night. After crossing the San Jacinto, they entered a wilderness country, in
						width from thirty to forty miles, and extending to the Sabine river, the eastern
						boundary of the State, a wild, uninhabited desert, abounding in marshes and jungles. On
						getting some forty miles into this wilderness, both men were taken sick. Their rations
						became exhausted, and after wandering about for some days, hunting a settlement or
						habitation, in vain, were obliged to stop from weakness. Evans became delirious from
						brain fever, and Bacome, from the effects of fever and ague, was rendered incapable of
						assisting him, or in any way alleviating his sufferings. In this deplorable condition,
						in the midst of a desert infested with wild animals, muttering around them by day and
						howling by night, with no hope, they looked for a horrible death. During the day, Bacome
						would roam over the wilderness, attempting to find even an unfriendly house, and return
						at night unsuccessful. Daylight would again find him on the same errand, to meet with
						the same disappointment, and to pass a horrible night with his suffering and sinking
						companion. Four days he passed in this way, but found no signs of a habitation, or of a
						human being. Bacome chose to remain with his companion until he died, rather than seek
						his own safety by deserting him to the beasts that were about him. At last, Evans died,
						alone with his suffering and helpless but faithful friend, with the howl of the wolf the
						last sound that fell upon his ear.</p>
					<p>Bacome dug a grave, as well as he could in his weak state, with sticks, and buried his
						comrade, and only then thought of his own safety. Almost exhausted, he nerved himself
						for a desperate effort to reach a habitation. After traveling a distance of twenty miles
						through canebrakes and swamps, almost impenetrable forests, miles of fallen timber
						overgrown with briars, he was compelled to give himself up. He was kindly treated until
						he was sufficiently recovered to return to prison. Even rebel sympathies were enlisted
						by the story of his sufferings.</p>
					<p>When Bacome returned to the stockade and related his sorrowful experience, a gloom was
						cast over his comrades of the regiment, for both Evans and Bacome were much
						respected.</p>
					<p>Bacome again escaped, in a few weeks, and was not heard of until March, when hearing
						that J. N. Mullins, a member of the Forty-sixth, was at Shreveport, on his way home, he
						sent him a line, stating that he was in prison at that place.</p>

					<pb id="VAB9258-146" n="146"/>

					<p>In addition to the escapes already narrated, there were numerous others. Of these, but
						one, so far as known, was successful. Lawrence Hartlerode, who left Camp Groce on the
						night of the 4th, reached the Union lines on the 21st of September. He left the prison
						at a time when some forty escaped. They divided into small parties, but were retaken
						with the above exception, at various times and on different stages of the journey.</p>
					<p>Of the Forty-sixth regiment, who were so unlucky, were Moses Tucker, Ellis Hughes,
						Alex. Reed, John Briggs, Theodore Taylor, George Oden, David Murphy, John T. Reece,
						Elihu Shaffer, George W. Nield, T. C. Jackson and Anthony A. Eskew. Tucker, Hughes,
						Briggs, Reed and Taylor went together on the night of the "big escape." Tucker gave up
						in two or three days, Briggs and Taylor were brought back in a short time, followed by
						Hughes and Reed. Oden, in company with two men from another regiment, got nearly to the
						Sabine, but, becoming sick, had to give up. They were taken to Houston and put in
						jail--again moved and put in jail, where he was when the prisoners of the Forty-sixth
						left Camp Groce. He was subsequently paroled. Murphy, Reece and Jackson met with the
						usual ill luck, and one fine day found themselves back in Camp Groce. Nield and Eskew
						were lost sight of shortly after they escaped. Shaffer escaped with Hartlerode, and was
						with him several days; they became separated, and Shaffer being sick, was obliged to
						give himself up. Jackson passed for a man of the Forty-sixth who was dead.</p>
					<p>In April, 1864, an expedition of four transports and gunboats was sent from New Orleans
						up the Sabine Pass, into Calcasieu bay, for cotton, cattle, etc. There accompanied the
						fleet a squad of thirty-seven men, from the "non-veteran camp" at Algiers, under command
						of a lieutenant of the Thirtieth Maine. The fleet had arrived in the bay, and while two
						of the boats were below, the others, the "Wave" and the "Granite State," while lying
						without steam, and no proper watch, and with their guard on the opposite shore, were
						attacked at daybreak one morning by a force, with a battery, from Sabine City. The boats
						were not iron-clad and were exposed, helpless and unmanageable, to the rebels, concealed
						along the bank. After a short but sharp conflict, the two boats surrendered. The
						infantry on shore had taken no part in the contest, and might have, for the present at
						least, escaped, but through mismanagement on the part of the officer in command, <pb
							id="VAB9258-147" n="147"/> they were captured. Among these prisoners were Maxwell
						Reece, R. V. McDowell, Hugh Quinn, Joshua T. Colvin, Philip M. Benjamin and Jacob
						Oliver, "non-veterans," of the Forty-sixth. The guard, with the officers and crews of
						the vessels, were taken to Sabine City, thence to Camp Groce, where they met the Red
						river delegation in August. The captured boats were hid away for a while in the Sabine
						river, but they afterwards engaged in the rebel service, and were .subsequently
						destroyed. But little was said about this unfortunate affair, and no one was ever called
						to account for the disaster. </p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> treatment of prisoners of war, by the rebels, is the foulest
						blot on the pages of the brief history of the Confederate Government. Whatever may be
						claimed for the rebel soldiers for courage and manhood, the Southern prison pens will
						always rise up to brand with infamy those who stood guard over their starved and naked
						captives, and to expose to the contempt of the civilized world those in command in
						Richmond who directed the machinery at Saulsbury, Andersonville, Libby, the Texas prison
						pens, and the many places of torture in the South, in creating and conducting the
						barbarous system under which Federal soldiers were destroyed. The uniformity in the
						conduct of rebel prisons proves that they had only one author and one purpose. The
						system was deliberately devised to destroy men who were captured in battle, and the
						purpose was most diligently and infamously carried out in each individual prison.
						Frequently complained to by the Federal authorities, Jefferson Davis and his colleagues
						could not be ignorant of the system, and, having full authority, those men should be
						held responsible.</p>

					<p rend="center b">THE VETERANS.</p>

					<p>G<hi rend="sc">ENERAL</hi> O<hi rend="sc">RDER</hi>, No. 191, War Department, June 25,
						1863, authorized the re-enlistment of three years' men who had already served two years,
						and awarded such a bounty of $400. This order was subsequently modified so that men
						being in the service nine <pb id="VAB9258-149" n="149"/> months, and having less than a
						year to serve, could take advantage of the original order. In the Department of the
						Gulf, General Banks ordered that, in addition to the bounty, re-enlisting men should
						have a furlough for thirty days, and transportation home and return. Large numbers from
						all the regiments in the Gulf Department re-enlisted under the original order, and
						enjoyed the furlough. The Forty-sixth Indiana began re-enlistment in November, 1863, and
						the new organization was completed in February, 1864, dating back to January 2, 1864.
						The veteran regiment numbered 307 men. The commissioned officers under the order were
						retained with the new organization and granted an honorable discharge on the expiration
						of their three years, or to continue with the regiment until the expiration of the new
						term, or the end of the war. The right of resignation was always with them. In the Third
						Division, special orders regulated the departure of the several regiments on their
						furlough, allowing only a limited number to go at a time. The Eleventh, Twenty-fourth
						and Thirty-fourth started home before the Red river expedition left Algiers, and it was
						expected that the Forty-sixth would go on the return of the first of the absent
						regiments. Those regiments, or some of them, returned just prior to or during the
						retreat down Red river, when furloughs were out of the question. Navigation on the river
						was prevented by rebel occupation, and the regiment was compelled to await better
						opportunities. The start was finally made on June 15, 1864.</p>

					<p rend="center b">THE NON-VETERANS.</p>

					<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> members of the Forty-sixth, not re-enlisting, were temporarily
						attached to the Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, and mustered for pay. Subsequently, all
						non-veterans were assigned to General Reynolds, for distribution. A non-veteran camp was
						finally established at Algiers, and Major B. F. Schermerhorn, of the Forty-sixth
						Indiana, placed in command. The men were used on detailed service, and rendered valuable
						assistance on many occasions. Several of the Forty-sixth men were sent up the river, as
						guards on transports, and several, on other duty, worked themselves into the Texas
						prisons, and enjoyed the society of their former comrades. The non-veterans were
						discharged as their original terms expired.</p>
