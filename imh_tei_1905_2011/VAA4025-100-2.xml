                    Stephenson, again drew national attention after the discovery of Klan records dating back to the
                    1920s. In March, Don Roberts, a local building contractor, chanced upon a trunk in the barn of a
                    property he had recently acquired. The trunk contained over one thousand membership cards and dues
                    receipts revealing the names of <placeName>

                    Empire of the Ku Klux Klan. Hoods, sashes, and an eighteen–inch electric cross were also
                    among the contents. After rejecting an offer from a private collector, Roberts decided to donate all
                    the Klan material to the <placeName>

                    historical society's board of directors voted unanimously to accept Roberts's
                    donation. At the same time it established the policy that the Klan records would not be placed on
                    public display, with access limited to genealogical or scholarly purposes. Curious individuals could
                    inquire whether specific relatives' names appeared in the records, but names could not be
                    published without consent of both the society and the individual's

            <p>The discovery of the Klan records, and the issue of what would be done with them, precipitated a wave
                    of media attention that astounded residents of this county seat located ten miles northeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The story was featured on Indiana television news broadcasts and was circulated across
                    the country by the Associated Press. Feature stories in the nation's leading newspapers
                    included local residents' comments on the town's prior record of discrimination.
                    The revelation of these Klan records, wrote Dirk Johnson of the <placeName>

                    confront its racist past." Judy Pasternak of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> Times, in an article entitled "Trunk Opens Up Indiana Town's Secret
                    Klan Past," cited Don Roberts's comment that the local Klan's ranks
                    included "pillars of the community." The articles by Pasternak and Johnson
                    provided platforms for critics of the decision not to publicize names. Stephenson biographer William
                    Lutholtz, historian Nancy McLean, and John W. Jarrett of the NAACP in nearby Anderson, Indiana,
                    argued the historical and social benefits of full disclosure. Sam H.Jones, president of the Urban

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, argued against the decision to limit access to scholars: "History is very
                    important to me. It helps me to understand the past and to chart future directions. The Klan is very
                    much alive in Indiana, so it would be important to know more about its roots." <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-100-2-010"/> David Heighway then director of the county historical society,
                    defended the board's decision. He explained, "If it had been 10 more years, there
                    wouldn't have been any problem at all. … The local community is really important
                    to us. We don't want to offend them."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a time, Heighway, Roberts, and Burgess were deluged with telephone calls from reporters and
                    others. <hi rend="i">Newsweek</hi> entered die fray when its "Perspective" column
                    featured a statement by Burgess describing the men he had personally known whose names appeared on
                    the Klan rosters as "fine, decent people." The magazine misrepresented his words
                    as a cumulative assessment of all those who were listed on "the town's
                    70–year–old Ku Klux Klan membership rolls." Some residents were
                    bewildered by the attention; one historical society board member couldn't understand
                    "all the hullabaloo. … The media has their way of blowing things out of all
                        proportion."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that some of
                    Roberts's friends inquired why he had not simply burned the records. Several years later
                    Roberts reflected, "Well, you can't burn history, you know. That's what
                    is wrong today. Too many people are trying to bury history, and history is history. You may have
                    liked to change it, but it's gone, it's behind us."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fortunately, Roberts did not attempt to "burn history," and the
                    Nobles–ville Klan records will be preserved as a valuable resource for those seeking a
                    better understanding of the operations of the Hoosier "Invisible Empire." While
                    the commotion over the records' discovery soon subsided, and only a few residents have
                    inquired into their ancestors' possible membership,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> the Klan, as

            <p>Historian Carl Becker observed many years ago that history, as we grapple with it, is "the
                        <hi rend="i">memory</hi> of things said and done."<hi rend="sup">9</hi> What we
                    "know" and remember about the past may be very different from what actually
                    happened, particularly if the subject is, in retrospect, an unpleasant one. This article explores
                    what we might learn today about the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Klan of the 1920s, utilizing not just the newly discovered records, but local histories
                    and official accounts, personal recollections, and contemporary press accounts. It examines as well
                    how the community has "constructed" its historical understanding of its
                    involvement with the Klan. It addresses the sensitive issue of how a community deals with the fact
                    that its most respected citizens, its esteemed forefathers, embraced an organization which now is
                    commonly regarded as an anathema, a gross antithesis of the fundamental ideals of this nation.</p>
            <p>While the community's embarrassment and regret over its Klan past appears genuine, there has
                    been difficulty in coming to grips with some of the more disturbing implications of the
                    organization's overwhelming, if relatively brief, appeal in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> The article also considers how the discovery of the Klan records has become part of the
                    process by which a community has been compelled to reexamine and even possibly redefine its sense of
                    community as well as its history.</p>
            <p>Considerable debate exists within the historical profession over the significance of the Klu Klux
                    Klan movement, given its multiple and diverse manifestations in this nation over the past century
                    and a half. Popular readings tend to blur together the massive movement of the 1920s, the earlier
                    post–Civil War Klan that challenged radical Reconstruction, and the later multitude of
                    splinter groups that appropriated the Klan name in vicious endeavors to undermine the civil rights
                    movement of the 1960s and to vilify a broad array of minority groups. Among historians who
                    distinguish these phases from one another, disagreements nevertheless remain. The orthodox view of
                    the 1920s Klan as a nativist, racist, and sometimes violent movement, centered in rural or small

                    studies that have noted the strength of the movement in urban areas and its complex regional
                    variations. Revisionists have suggested that authentic social, political, and economic problems,
                    including corruption, vice, and the trampling of Prohibition, played a larger role in stimulating
                    Klan support than did ethnic, racial, or religious tensions, although such tensions were often
                    entwined with the other issues. Demographic analysis of Klan membership has revealed that, rather
                    than coming from marginal economic groups as earlier studies had suggested, citizens of the
                    Invisible Empire came mostly from the economic and social mainstream of American life. These
                    individuals, revisionists contended, could not be dismissed as irrational or paranoid, and their
                    propensity towards violence had been greatly exaggerated.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Yet there are
                    contemporary scholars, including Nancy MacLean, who seem unconvinced by these revisionist arguments
                    and continue to focus on the nativist and racist aspects of the movement while at the same time
                    exploring additional ideological and gender issues.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Thus if residents of <placeName>

            <p>The Klan movement which took root in Indiana during the twenties fed upon these racial, religious,

                    concluded that "the theme of the discourse was either of wide interest to the general
                    public or there must have been a thousand members or more of the organization in this locality who
                    desired to hear something said in public about the workings of the invisible empire."
                    Mincing few words, Moore proclaimed the need for Protestant Americans to have their own
                    organization. The foreign element, he announced, posed a threat to the enforcement of the Eighteenth
                    Amendment, and the preacher referred to the "poison in the melting pot." He stated
                    that the Klansmen believed "that every colored person should keep his place," and
                    warned against the danger of racial intermarriage. He deplored the Jew who failed to accept Christ
                    and who "holds the dime so close to his eye that he cannot see the dollar beyond."
                    It would be unwise, he continued, "to allow the Jewish element to control the finances of

                    suggested that they held a disproportionate number of government appointments and that they failed
                    to respect the principle of the separation of church and state. Catholics, he maintained,
                    "cannot continue allegiance to the Pope of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and still be loyal to the institutions of America." In his conclusion, Moore

            <p>As preparations for the trial began in June, the Ledger began to publish, on virtually a daily basis,
                    an unsigned front–page column entitled "Klan Komment," which sought to
                    clarify the organization's objectives. The column, which ran for several months, compared
                    the Klan to fraternal organizations such as the Masons, Odd Fellows, and Elks, but it also spelled
                    out in very clear terms the organization's support of white supremacy, racial purity,
                    prohibition enforcement, separation of church and state, and immigration restriction.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> It expressed alarm at the number of Roman Catholic federal employees and concluded that
                    "there are nations and races that can never by any process of education or assimilation
                    become Americanized, and we have determined that the time shall come when there will be no place in
                    America for people who cannot think in terms of Americanism."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The
                    enemies of the Klan were described as "the measly, motley mob of misfits," and
                    readers were queried as to whether they preferred to be controlled by native–born white
                    Protestants of good character, or by foreigners, criminals, and degenerates.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

            <p>The discovered Klan records do not contain the names of the Ledger's editor and manager
                    (Edward E. Neal and Charles S. Neal), but the Neals's paper often appeared to endorse Klan
                    activities and strongly echoed Klan sentiments regarding aliens and prohibition. Editorials
                    expressed little hope that undesirable immigrants from southern Europe could be assimilated.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> These people were not only the prime violators of prohibition but were the
                    nation's most egregious criminals. "Too many people," one editorial
                    complained, "get into Uncle Sam's land who have no right here and who have no
                    regard for any laws, human or divine. It is these men and women who come, not being properly
                    scrutiniz'ed, and they form the rum–running, hi–jacking bands, the
                    gunmen, the gangs of bandits and murderers which infect the big cities and even now get out into the

                    frequent articles about Klan donations to county churches and others in need undoubtedly enhanced

                    Klan by pointing to its benevolent works were not entirely disingenuous. Revisionist studies have
                    tended to stress that in many regions local klaverns seemed more preoccupied with addressing
                    legitimate social and moral reforms than in harassing minority groups. Leonard Moore, for example,
                    maintains that this movement is "best understood not as a nativist organization
                    … but rather as a populist organization," and he contends that Indiana Klansmen
                    were predominantly concerned with socio–political issues such as prohibition enforcement
                    and eliminating vice and political corruption.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> While evidence suggests that
                    Moore might have underestimated the significance of the Klan's nativism in places such as <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the "populist" features of the movement were certainly present (if

                    biting, praising the recently passed National Origins Act, which sharply restricted the immigration
                    of certain national and ethnic groups, for building "a stone wall around the nation so
                    tall, so deep and so strong that the scum and riff–raff of the old world cannot get into
                    our gates," and arguing that "the colored man" should be "kept
                    in his place." Yet there was also an element of defensiveness in Evans's remarks
                    as he refuted news accounts that the Klan was declining in the wake of the Stephenson scandal.
                    "If the Klan is dead," he replied, "then America is dead."
                    Moreover, one of the scheduled featured speakers, Robbie Gill, head of the national Women of the Ku
                    Klux Klan, failed to appear. The <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi>, which in the past had boosted the Klan
                    with accounts of large crowds, uncharacteristically said nothing about overall attendance at Klan
                    Day other than to mention that the last session, an address by Judge Orbison on the need to more
                    thoroughly Americanize the nation's schools, was well attended "despite the rain
                    in the late afternoon." (Three years after the event, however, the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi>
                    reported that its files revealed that only several hundred had attended the Klan Day meeting). The
                    paper did note that the Chautauqua Association's largest single source of income that year
                    was the local Klan's agreed contribution of $1,250, but added that the
                    chautauqua's board of directors, the evening before Klan Day, had decided "not to
                    turn next year's program over to any organization." The board, the <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> reported, announced that the 1926 event would be "strictly a community
                    affair to which every organization of every kind will be invited. A better and a big'ger
                    program in every way is promised next year."<hi rend="sup">64</hi> As the 1926 chautauqua
                    approached, the board solicited the support of the "entire community," and made no
                    mention of any special role for the Klan. The event was such a failure that there was some doubt as
                    to whether a chautauqua would take place in 1927.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

                    the old county jail in the town square, as the 1925 chautauqua was taking place. What is sometimes
                    overlooked is that by then Stephenson, often credited with building the Indiana Klan into a potent
                    force, had broken with the Evans organization. Just a few months after Stephenson's
                    dramatic installation as Grand Dragon in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kokomo</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 4, 1923, he had stepped down from his official position because of
                    disagreements with the national leadership. Evans had refused to provide financial support for
                    Stephenson's efforts to take over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Stephenson was also upset by the Evans organization's propensity
                    towards violence and its failure to map out a coherent national political program. In the spring of
                    1924, well before the Oberholtzer affair, Stephenson was officially banished from the Evans Klan
                    amidst charges of drunkenness and womanizing, with Walter Bossert succeeding him as Grand Dragon.
                    Stephenson assumed leadership over an autonomous Klan group, and Hoosier klandom was in effect split
                    into two warring organizations.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> A significant number of <placeName>

                    gathered beneath the outside window of his cell, threatening to kill him if he revealed Klan

                    bookkeepers. While the white–collar category represented a significant proportion (38.5
                    percent) of the total, it was surpassed by those who fell in the skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled
                    workers categories. These blue–collar workers (together with farmers) constituted a
                    majority (61 percent) of the Klansmen. The skilled category contained 17 molders who worked for the
                    Union Sanitary Company, 18 mill workers, 15 carpenters, and 15 mechanics. The 117 <hi rend="i">semiskilled</hi> workers who represented the largest single occupational category (31.3

                    </placeName> Klan membership. While business and professional men played an important leadership
                    role and constituted a significant percentage, they were a minority of the total membership,
                    outnumbered by those in the blue–collar worker categories. It is possible that
                    individuals in many different occupations may have experienced some economic or social pressure to
                    join the Klan. Yet quite clearly the belief that the Klan to a large degree consisted of coerced
                    businessmen is an oversimplification, and the situation in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> adds support to the revisionist contention that Klan membership represented a broad
                    spectrum of the population. It also must be kept in mind that the 450 men who can be identified as

                        places "Merchant with sufficient property" in the high white–collar

                    percentage, if not a majority, of local officials. Of the fifteen top city officials listed in the

                    seven can be identified from the same records. Of the twenty–four top county posts in the

                    expressed outrage against the racial bigotry of "so–called 100 per cent loyal
                    and Christian persons." William H. Stern, a Civil War veteran, life–long
                    Republican, and one of the oldest native–born residents of the county, wrote that such
                    racism made his blood boil, and insisted that the "colored race has as much
                    right… to their freedom and enjoyment <list type="footnotes">

                            conviction. There is a list of 63 members who were delinquent in dues for the first quarter
                            of 1926. In addition, there is a set of four–part cards, providing the names of
                            263 members who apparently were remiss in paying dues in 1926. Of these 263, the cards
                            indicate that 27 eventually paid dues sometime in 1926, and that another 11 requested a
                            postponement in paying their dues. Subtracting these two groups would leave a total of 225
                            members in arrears who were not seeking a postponement. Four of these 225 filled out cards
                            submitting formal resignations of membership. The names of two of these 225 members also
                            appear on the list of 63 who were delinquent the first quarter of 1926. If one makes
                            allowance for these duplicates, this gives a total of 286 who were behind in paying their
                            dues and had made no provisions for a postponement. This would represent a sizable

                    has had to reckon with why so many of its residents became members. Even before the discovery of the
                    Klan records, residents knowledgeable in local history were aware of the support the Invisible
                    Empire had enjoyed throughout the county. Joseph Roberts, in a 1992 <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-100-2-047"/> address to the local Kiwanis, acknowledged that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName> had played an important role in Stephenson's rise to power as well in as his

                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> played in Stephenson's downfall is the conviction that many who had joined the
                    Klan, particularly among the merchant or business class, did so under coercion, believing the Klan
                    to be a patriotic, charitable organization and largely unaware of the group's bigoted
                    ideology. Once these members learned of the Klan's actual ideology and its inner
                    corruption, they quickly withdrew in large numbers.</p>
            <p>Foland, for example, maintained that "Businessmen joined the organization [the Klan] as an
                    insurance to the fact they could meet their bills. They were forced into joining." He
                    described a business owner who "was approached by a Klan member and told he had better join
                    or his business would be destroyed." Roberts observed that "a lot of people joined
                    the Klan to protect their business. Others really believed in the Klan. They thought the
                    organization stood for good things. They were gullible people and I felt sorry for
                        them."<hi rend="sup">142</hi> In a Kiwanis address a number of years later his son
                    suggested, "The Klan was sold as a patriotic organization. It backed the isolation politics
                    of the day. Although it was an organization of WASPS (white Anglo–Saxon Protestants), it
                    was not known in Indiana as an anti–black or anti–Jewish group."<hi rend="sup">143</hi> County historian Joe Burgess also believed that many men joined the Klan to
                    prevent harassment or boycotts.<hi rend="sup">144</hi> Prior to his discovery of the Klan records,
                    Don Roberts had known of the group's activities, but he, too, had been led to believe that
                    merchants joined under threat of boycott, and that the Klan of the 1920s, with its emphasis on
                    patriotism, was a very different type of organization than today's.<hi rend="sup">145</hi>

                    sanitized image of that organization as "a noble and chivalrous group that saved the South
                    from the ravages of Reconstruction." The second Klan was not well received, however, and in
                    1917 the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated a plaque, affixed to the old courthouse, which
                    was designed to honor the founders and simultaneously disassociate them from the new Klan, which the
                    daughters considered "unworthy of the name made sacred by men who bore it in years gone
                    by.'" There was again consternation when, beginning in 1985, latter–day

                    they do so with the needs of contemporary culture clearly in mind—manipulating the past
                    in order to mqld the present." He observes that, "We arouse and arrange our
                    memories to suit our psychic needs."<hi rend="sup">155</hi> Kammen also notes the tendency
                    of those dealing with their local histories to reconcile the antithetical values of tradition and
                    progress in order to extol a "'tradition of progress.'"<hi rend="sup">156</hi> To varying degrees, Nobles–ville, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pulaski</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Stone Mountain have all chosen paths of reconstruction in dealing with their
                    uncomfortable pasts.<hi rend="sup">157</hi>

            <p>Undeniably, the citizens of <placeName>

                    </placeName> are making serious attempts to understand their past and to make amends for past
                    mistakes through present actions. The Klan years are an intrinsic part of the history of <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, and many people in the community have come to accept that fact. They have, to
                    paraphrase Don Roberts, refused to burn their history. This attitude is reflected in the decisions
                    of the historical society in dealing with the Klan records and in editorials in the <hi rend="i">Ledger.</hi> On the other hand, the process of reconstructing <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s history as it relates to the Klan and other racist and nativist movements
                    remains problematic. It is understandable that residents today have difficulty in getting the Klan
                    right, given that the group can be perceived as a fraternal organization, as a reform movement that
                    appealed to people's patriotism and idealism, and as a sinister, corrupt enterprise <list type="footnotes">

                    amends through a number of efforts, including bestowing the key to the city to a third individual,
                    James Cameron, whose life was somehow spared by an enraged white mob. <placeName>

                    </placeName> must be understood in the context of prejudices that preceded Indiana's Klan
                    era and persisted many years thereafter.<hi rend="sup">158</hi> In this sense, too, it is difficult
                    to burn history. The disconcerting events that took place in Nobles–ville during the
                    1920s cannot be erased by any process.</p>
            <p>A close examination of the available evidence indicates that the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Klan was a manifestation of the racism, nativism, and anti–Catholicism that
                    was a central ingredient of white, Anglo–Saxon, Protestant culture, both before and
                    during the 1920s—even in a locality that might legitimately claim countervailing
                    traditions of tolerance. If the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> records lend strong support to the revisionist argument that the twenties Klan should
                    be seen as a mainstream movement, not as a group of demented, marginalized misfits, other available
                    sources very much suggest that the Invisible Empire could not have achieved such tremendous support

                    degrees by revisionists and very much emphasized by their critics). Klan leaders explicitly pandered
                    to these prejudiced sentiments, with considerable success.</p>
            <p>"Getting right with the Klan" is no easy task, either for historians or for
                    communities trying to come to terms with their past. By the time of the 1995 discovery of the Klan
                    records, there was general acknowledgment that there was something shameful about the
                    Klan's one–time strong presence in the community. The public discussion of what

                    sensitivities. Locals also express genuine pride in the plaque in the courthouse, and the building
                    itself has become a symbol of a community attempting to "do the right thing." The
                    objections raised by historians and African–American spokespersons to the policy of
                    restricting access to the records demonstrate, however, that not everyone would agree that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was doing the right thing. Those who appreciate a local historical society's
                    need for broad public trust and support will empathize with the dilemma faced by the board of
                    directors; at the same time it is possible to see why some might interpret their decision as one
                    more act of denial. Moreover, the "progressive" local spin on what happened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Noblesville</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the 1920s tends to obscure the essential point that the Klan of the twenties was
                    a painful symptom of racial, ethnic, and religious antagonisms that were deeply rooted in the
                    town's—indeed the nation's—past.</p>
            <p>Historical researchers face a parallel quandary. There are still many unresolved issues that surround
                    the phenomenal success of the Klan of the twenties, including the motives of those who joined and
                    then left the organization.<hi rend="sup">159</hi> It is important that historians and others
                    scholars examine and reexamine these matters. As historian and cultural critic George Lipsitz
                    reminds us, "What we choose to remember about the past, where we begin and end our
                    retrospective accounts, and who we include and exclude from them—these do a lot to

                    the elected officials, not just our cultural leadership, but the grass roots—everyday
                    citizens who have a sense of the importance of history as evidenced by the historic architecture and

               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: I think a lot of it has to do with the rising awareness of what is now, but was
                    not previously, recognized in each community as valuable and worthwhile. There seems to have been a
                    reversal somewhere in the almost thirty years that I've been working here, from an attitude
                    of "that old building, that eyesore, let's get rid of it and move on" to
                    "wait a minute, what does that building, that historic site, tell us about ourselves, about
                    our community?" That interest has coalesced into over 200 local organizations devoted to
                    the preservation of their community's architectural heritage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">Sal Cilella</hi>: Reid can see this more dramatically than we can by the physical
                    evidence of buildings and people wanting to save them. We don't usually deal with that kind
                    of evidence, except in my own case. My first professional job was as the director of the Northern
                    Indiana Historical Society. I was there from 1970 to 1973, and our museum occupied an 1854
                    courthouse in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph County</region>
                    </placeName>, which the citizens of the county and the politicians had saved. They went further than
                    that after I left. They saved the Oliver Mansion down the street, physically moved the historical
                    society out of the courthouse down to the mansion, and established a new Northern Indiana Center for
                    History. Most importantly they saved the old courthouse. I went through it when I came back to
                    Indiana two years ago. It is magnificent, and it's being shown in something of the same
                    condition <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-100-2-056"/> in which it was established, with clerks'
                    offices, judges' offices, and a refurbished courtroom on the second floor.</p>
            <p>As far as history is concerned, it's more difficult to gauge if we've come a long
                    way or not. I think perhaps, falling back on the model of a building, that this building
                    we're sitting in now—which the citizens of Indiana and the society's
                    board put together for $40 million—is a prime example. A staff member told me
                    once, "Isn't it wonderful that people would spend all that money on
                    history?" So maybe it's the building that is the tangible evidence of our progress
                    in both fields.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: How would you rank Indiana with other states in their dedication to history and
                    historic preservation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: It's different in different states. We have somewhat similar
                    backgrounds. You were in Savannah, [<placeName>

               </placeName>, for fourteen years. History in the

                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, is the story of vast hordes of immigrants coming into this country, wave after wave
                    after wave. Very little of that in the South, so the region had a more homogeneous population. The
                    greater ethnic diversity in the North impacted our history and how it is transmitted from generation
                    to generation.</p>

                    that they "didn't know Indiana had any history." We have 10,500 members.
                    RW: We have nearly 10,300.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: But that is another indicator that we are offering a product people are
                    interested in. One of the problems we have here in Indiana is that we are too shy about our
                    successes. We don't like to brag about things. I think we've got a lot to brag
                    about in these two areas.</p>
            <p>FUNDING FOR HISTORY</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: We indeed have some of the largest, best–funded history
                    organizations, which is due, of course, to Mr. Eli Lilly. But is there also something to what we
                    hear about "Hoosier heritage"? What do you think makes being a part of these
                    organizations so important to people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: I think it's a matter of having individuals recognize who they are,
                    what they are, and where they come from. Their heritage tells them that. Once that occurs, then
                    selling our institutions, if you will, selling our <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-100-2-057"/> history,
                    becomes easy. Raising money becomes easy, getting political clout becomes easier, but it all has to
                    emanate from the grass roots. It has to come from the citizenry. That's what influences the
                    politicians, and that's why Sal was able to raise $40 million for his History
                    Center and we were able to raise $2.5 million to build our new headquarters along with
                    additional funds to establish nine field offices around the state.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: That is a model to which everybody ought to aspire. Our challenge is to get
                    into the grass roots instead of being isolated in the capital, as we sometimes feel we are. One of
                    the Historical Society's greatest challenges is to be a statewide institution, and often
                    people keep pulling us back to being an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> institution. I want to set up the same geographic kind of outreach [as Historic
                    Landmarks], but it's much different in our situation. They can rally around physical
                    buildings; we rally around something more amorphous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: If you had the regional offices, how would you be able to go out and do the
                    same thing? I know that you have the local history services. SC: That's where I'd
                    start, with our local history services. They would have the task of dividing the state, using
                    Landmarks as a model with its nine districts, work with a strong historical society in each region,
                    start working with them as partners, or affiliate with them on some level.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Would you create regional offices?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Yes, if we could afford it, but we aren't in a position to do it yet.
                    RW: Look at the money expended on this wonderful facility we're in, put that together with
                    the eleven locations that we have, including our museums, and you've really got some
                    significant committed money, but more important is the significant representation of historic
                    interests that abound in the state. All of our regional offices have advisory councils that are
                    comprised of cultural and heritage leaders within their area who, in turn, are responsible for
                    leading their local groups. So there is a massive network that is more lateral than vertical. There
                    are some holes still left in the state, but in general we're fairly well covered now. SC:
                    Let me remind you too that we're both non–profit. We are not a part of the
                    government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: And you think that's important?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Absolutely. It provides you a greater amount of creativity and freedom than you
                    can imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: In the past few years we have seen around the nation many historical sites shut
                    down, and libraries and archives cut back on staff. How have you weathered the budgetary situation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: We at Historic Landmarks have had to make some minor cuts, no major
                    programmatic cuts, and that's because our contributors and supporters <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-100-2-058"/> have stayed with us as we have weathered the downturn of these last
                    three years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Where we differ greatly is in fundraising. We started in the
                    fund–raising game very, very late, because at one time the society had such a large
                    endowment that it didn't need to raise any money. This building pulled the society out of
                    its shell. The board said, "We want to do public programs, we want to get more involved in
                    the community." And that cultural change led to fundraising. The first year that the
                    society did any serious fundraising was 1994. In that entire year we raised as much money as we
                    raised this past October [2003]. That's how far we've come in nine years.
                    We're catching up, but it's going to take awhile. RW: That's an
                    interesting parallel. When I was first hired we too were living off "Mr.
                    Eli's" largesse. I was informed of this in one of my first board meetings after
                    presenting a new membership program. I think we had 200 or 300 members then. They didn't do
                    fundraising: "We do not solicit!" I wondered if I had made a mistake in coming
                    here. That's what we do in the nonprofit world—we fundraise. So actually our
                    change was very similar. We started earlier because I was hired earlier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Let's stay on the budget issue. Given the diverse needs of
                    contemporary society, how can you justify support for history, history education, and historic
                    preservation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: That's a good question. As director of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Museum of Art in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, my main job was to sell art, and now I'm back in the history field, selling
                    history, I've got to say that it's much easier selling history than it is art or
                    anything else. The reason is that everybody's got a history, whether it is personal or
                    extended family. And that is intriguing and understandable, whereas art is not always.
                    Unfortunately, many Americans don't care about art. Those same people, though, have a
                    family memory and a family history. They relate to history. That's the key to Landmarks and
                    the Society. People in this country love old houses and they love to know about their roots.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Everybody has personal landmarks: a grandparent's home, the school
                    where they first matriculated, the church, synagogue, or temple where they first learned about a
                    higher being, etc., so in our business it's a relatively easy sell. Now we don't
                    ask just everybody; we're selective. Our programs for fundraising are targeted to specific
                    individuals for specific projects, but they come from a broad base of citizens who are already in
                    our network as members and give us leads. The whole process then relates back to local history and
                    local landmarks, because every community has them, just as every person does.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: It's a cliche, but we're all looking for our roots and our
                    personal history. <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-100-2-059"/>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and I'm so glad to see that the historical society is doing what
                    it's doing."</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Have you seen a growing interest in history over the years that you've
                    been involved? Nationally, we've seen rising attendance at museums, history book clubs, a
                    history television channel, documentaries including Ken Burns's films, but in your tenure
                    have you seen a wider public acceptance of history and historic preservation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Sure—our growth in membership, from 300 to over 10,000, and the
                    explosion of local historic preservation organizations, from a dozen to more than 200, are, I think,
                    the best evidences of that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Yes, I see it all the time. Again, it goes back to individuals and family and
                    history and roots. I want to know where I came from; I want to preserve where I came from; and I
                    want to preserve as much as I can. It <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-100-2-060"/> seems almost instinctual.
                    Now, what they're getting when they come here is another question. If they go through an
                    exhibit, for example, do they take back knowledge? You see a decline in attendance in places like <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which has not achieved a million visitors since the early 1990s. They hope to hit
                    750,000 this year. You ask yourself, "What is going on here?" There are books like
                    a biography of John Adams sitting on top of the best seller list; and now all the founding fathers
                    are hot. Currently there are four biographies of Benjamin Franklin on the market. Maybe people
                    aren't really reading these books but giving them to each other as gifts.</p>
            <p>BALANCING THE PUBLIC AND THE ACADEMIC</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Since both of your institutions serve diverse yet similar audiences, how do you
                    position yourself to address the concerns of the academics and professionals on the one side and
                    deal with the general public on the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: We use architectural historians who are academics to lay the blueprint for us,
                    to show us what's historic in our communities, what are the most important historic
                    structures, the next most important, etc. We actually do have an historic site rating system, and we
                    rely on the academics to give us an objective appraisal of all of our sites, places, and buildings
                    around the state. Our information is credible, and we can hold it up whenever a threat is imminent
                    for a particular historic landmark. These appraisals are often the basis for our arguments against
                    the destruction of a landmark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: This is one of my favorite questions, and it's a fascinating issue.
                    First of all, I think it's a bit of a false dichotomy, the popular versus the scholarly. I
                    think that scholarship, at least at this institution now, is not an end product but a process. We
                    must continue that process in order to produce a popular product. If we don't use the
                    scholarly process to produce that popular result, then we are no different than Disneyland. I tell
                    my staff that research and our library are the differences between us and Disneyland. People are
                    looking for entertainment, for history as entertainment, and the great change in the last 30 years
                    has been this shift from the scholarly to the popular.</p>
            <p>Years ago, institutions like ours were focused on a very narrow scholarly niche of the American
                    populace. We were criticized just recently for not producing more scholarly books. The comment
                    revealed an ignorance of the book publishing market on the part of the speaker. If we published <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-100-2-061"/> books for only that narrow niche, we would go out of business
                    in a heartbeat. I think many authors are writing to the popular taste today, but I don't
                    think they've diluted the scholarly basis of it. We just met with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society Press. They do 28 books a year on topics all over the ballpark but
                    all related to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> history. We need to do more that's related to Indiana history written in a
                    popular vein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: You have established your own press?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: We've been doing publications for years, and we just changed the name.
                    We are now the IHS Press. It gives us stature and an instant degree of public recognition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: This raises the issue of the rise of public history within the past 30 years.
                    Are you finding more individuals—whether it be professionals, academics, or those in
                    historic preservation—willing to make that crossover in their writing and public
                    speaking?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Whether this is on point or not, I don't know. Ten percent of our
                    employees are Phi Beta Kappa graduates. I could not say that ten years ago. If Phi Beta Kappa is an
                    emblem of scholarship, we are attracting many more of the "best and brightest"
                    than we used to. I think that's terribly important.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: What we're talking about here is language. Thirty years ago, when a
                    scholar wrote for other scholars, he or she would write in the most academic, turgid way possible.
                    Today you can convey that same information in a very readable format. You've got to make
                    history accessible to everybody, and that's what we're doing. But you still need
                    that scholarly basis.</p>
            <p>And thirty years ago you wouldn't find in a museum a restaurant, a gift shop, an auditorium,
                    classrooms, and public spaces like we have now. That's a huge change in the museum field.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Do you think that part of that is the influence of Disney?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: When Disney first came into popularity years and years ago, there were a lot of
                    historic preservation people condemning it and damning it as artificial. I was one of those who did
                    not. I rather welcomed it because I felt it would do what I think it's done, which is to
                    raise awareness of some basic forms of historic American architecture. It's a different
                    scope; it's a different method of presentation; and, yes, it is all artificial. But to be
                    there in person on the artificial cobblestone sidewalk in that artificial setting and see citizens
                    of this country relate those artificial historic buildings to something back home, I think is
                    valuable, and I think that it popularizes and makes what we have around us every day even more
                    understandable and therefore more valuable.</p>

            <p>THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF PUBLIC HISTORY</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Let's shift gears and talk about careers. Have career opportunities in
                    your professions changed over the course of your tenures? And if so, how?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Historic preservation is a relatively new offering in academia and the heritage
                    professions in our country. Historical societies, written history, and historical research have been
                    around a lot longer. Yet I think that historic preservation has grown at an accelerated rate
                    compared to the rest of the heritage and history field, including the area of careers. Fifteen years
                    ago we had three graduate programs in historic preservation, and there are now nearly twenty.
                    Fifteen years ago there were maybe <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-100-2-064"/> a half–dozen
                    places to get an undergraduate certificate or an associate degree in historic preservation. Now
                    there are over twenty accredited colleges and universities where you can major in historic
                    preservation. That has been a huge boost to providing the generalists whom we hire to do historic
                    preservation work around the country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: In the museum field we have seen an increase in professionalism in the last
                    thirty years. In 1970 there were three programs in the entire <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Now you can get a museum studies course or program in virtually every major
                    institution in this country. The number of people going into the field has increased exponentially.
                    The thing that I don't see, which is sad, is diversity. You don't see minorities
                    entering the field, and that has got to change.</p>
            <p>MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC HISTORY</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Now there is a National Museum Fellows Program headquartered at the Adanta
                    History Center that tries to get minorities involved.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Do you have the same
                    problem in historic preservation, the absence of diversity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Our national organization, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has
                    had the same problem.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> They have a national reach with offices across the
                    country, and they have a dedicated program to hire minority career track historic preservationists,
                    but they have rarely met their goal. We have tried in Indiana, but I must say not successfully.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Same here. We've publicly committed to minority hiring, but we
                    can't find qualified candidates; and when we do, private industry can offer more lucrative
                    wages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: We have created an African American Landmarks Committee, one of our most
                    effective and active committees, comprised of African–American leaders across the state
                    involved in heritage and history, and we give a scholarship each year through that committee. But in
                    every case, for 10 years since we've been giving this scholarship, the young man or young
                    woman who has received the scholarship has gone on to another career.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Is there anything that we can do to attract minorities into this particular
                    profession?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: To me it's a long–term answer. For example, we have had to
                    learn anew about African–American culture. Through our African American <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-100-2-065"/> Landmarks Committee, we have learned that what is important to
                    their past, their heritage, their experience, is not necessarily what we have learned to record as
                    eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. I remember the first time we asked the
                    committee for their recommendations—most were places, rarely were they buildings.
                    Preservationists are trained to look at buildings and the like. These were <hi rend="i">places.</hi>
                    These were corners where jitney service was implemented by African Americans for African Americans
                    when they were not allowed to ride respectably on public transit. One such place was the corner of
                    College and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Street in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, recommended by the committee chairman Stanley <placeName>

                    </placeName>, former Dean of Education at DePauw University. That evening, before I went home, I
                    trekked out to 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and College and found a street corner. I didn't
                    find any emblematic serious piece of historic architecture. I found a street corner. But to Dr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> as he grew up, that was an important place in his neighborhood. So getting back to
                    questions about career tracks for minorities, I think that when our field becomes more
                    accommodating, loosens judgments on what's historic and what isn't, then young
                    people of minority cultures will see that their viewpoints are also recognized as important.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: We have just begun an initiative with the Latino community. We know from
                    demographics that within ten years 52 percent of the kids in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> schools will be Latinos. We have started a dialogue with the community, working with
                    the Mexican Counsel, to preserve their history, and they're excited about it.
                    We're not doing this so we can provide more converts to the field of history museums and
                    history, but to preserve their story as they move into the area. It would be great if we get a
                    Latino archivist or curator or director out of this some day. But we're starting from the
                    beginning by focusing on collections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: We have a huge mountain to overcome because historically new developments have
                    wiped out neighborhoods and landmarks of our minority communities. Our highway system did it
                    nationwide and did it here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The expansion of IUPUI, for instance, has virtually decimated what was once the proud
                    West End, leaving only Ransom Place, just a few small blocks, a small vestige of what was one of the
                    city's important residential neighborhoods. Look at Indiana Avenue, which used to be the
                    commercial and social focus of African–American activity and culture, and now
                    it's virtually gone. Where was historic preservation when we almost lost Lockefield
                    Gardens, one of the best examples of middle–income African–American segregated
                    housing? Until we can get past the bad experiences in which historic preservation has failed
                    minority communities, it's going to take some time.</p>
            <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-100-2-066"/>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: How did you address the African–American landmarks, and did you
                    purposely go out and reach for the Latino community?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Yes, we learned about the group LaPlaza, an umbrella organization of four
                    different Latino groups here in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and invited them to use our boardroom on a monthly basis. They took our offer, and now
                    we're talking to them about the need to preserve their heritage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Years ago, I found myself trying to defend African–American heritage
                    as exemplified by their historic architecture. Lockefield Gardens was a threshold issue; I was not
                    able or didn't know how to mobilize the African–American leadership and found
                    myself feeling awkward trying to talk about somebody else's heritage and culture. An
                    African American came to me one day to ask, "What are you doing now about
                    African–American landmarks?" I scratched my head. So we formed a committee
                    comprised of African Americans and that's how we got into it—personal experience
                    that was unpleasant and awkward but led to our asking this particular part of our community what was
                    important to them.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF HISTORY ORGANIZATIONS</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: That's a good segue way to questions about public perceptions. Sal,
                    the Indiana Historical Society began in 1830 as an effort to preserve the history of the young
                    state. It was established by civic and political leaders of the day. It essentially continued as an
                    old pioneer's club and as a men's club for many years. By the 1990s the society
                    had embarked upon extensive efforts of public outreach and programming. What about that change? I
                    know you weren't here at that time. What suddenly brought the society to thinking that they
                    needed to expand from their focus on scholarship to reach out into the community?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Ironically it was the need for more space. Space was getting tighter and
                    tighter over in the old library, and they began thinking in the early '90s about the need
                    for a new headquarters. One of the basic questions asked was, "What are we going to do in
                    this new headquarters?" And the answer was: "Public programs." One
                    question led to another: "If we do public programs we're going to have to raise
                    money to support them." The society didn't have a public program division until
                    1994. I've got to give a lot of credit to one of my predecessors, Hubert Hawkins in the
                    early 1970s. His vision was to be more publicly oriented. He wanted to bring the institution out of
                    its shell, but he did not have the wherewithal to do that until Mr. Lilly passed away in 1977 and
                    left this endowment that we now enjoy. In many respects we are living Hubert Hawkins's <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-100-2-067"/> dream of getting the society out from behind its shelves and
                    its bookcases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: So this has been a positive move, you think?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Oh, yes, because the society could go on forever with its endowment, but it
                    would never grow. It would only grow as much as the stock market went up or down, because it would
                    never be subject to any public scrutiny. Now that we accept money from the public, we have to be
                    answerable to them. Transparency is a good thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Okay, Reid, Historic Landmarks began in the 1960s as an advocate of identifying
                    and preserving historical properties and defining historical neighborhoods. Today it owns properties
                    around the state. It's involved in museum education programs at numerous sites and a
                    successful tour program. How did it start? Have these tours been a good thing for Historic
                    Landmarks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Fifteen years ago they were a failure. We closed our little concierge office in
                    the lobby of the Hyatt Hotel. We sold our two tour buses and had to wait because the community
                    wasn't ready. Maybe we weren't ready.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Has this public programming brought in new members? Has it changed the image of
                    Historic Landmarks?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: I think the answer is yes. What really helped us the most was building our own
                    building on the canal in 1991. Prior to that we were in a worse location and setup than was the
                    Historical Society. The IHS was then sharing a building with the State Library and had no
                    independent identity. We were worse. Our headquarters was in the gatehouse of <geogName>Crown
                    Hill</geogName> Cemetery. Beautiful building—bad location. And talk about bad branding.</p>
            <p>Placing ourselves in this high–development, high–visibility area, we moved the
                    oldest historic building along the canal to its current location where we then had to double the
                    size of it.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> This probably did more for our visibility than anything else we had
                    done to date. What did more for our respect was a lawsuit. In 1985 we entered a lawsuit against the
                        <geogName>White River</geogName> Park Development Commission which did not follow the
                    state's heritage and historic preservation laws when they tore down a historic school,

               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: An interesting historical contrast between these two organizations.
                    We're 100 years older than they are, but we still haven't caught up to where they
                    are because we were a closed society for so many years. This building has truly been
                    transformational. Our challenge in gaining the respect that Reid's talking about is to make
                    this building a vibrant, viable place for people to come together and learn about their history, not
                    just Indiana history but the broader context of U.S. and world history.</p>
            <p>HISTORY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE STATE</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Unfortunately, we have had to go to court more times than I would like in order
                    to defend state heritage laws. I'd like to get into both of our relationships with the
                    state. It's one of the ways that Sal and his organization and ours have collaborated
                    recently, and I hope for more. There is now a willingness to go to the mat when right is right and
                    wrong is wrong. That was not true years ago.</p>
            <p>I think we have the highest standards for public heritage and history in the Indiana Historical
                    Society and Historic Landmarks, but the state does not take advantage of either of our institutions
                    as much as they could. The IHS is willing and ready to take over the state archives
                    mess—it's inaccessible, remote, and understaffed. The society has offered to do
                    that on a collaborative management agreement, but the state has not taken advantage of the offer. We
                    are both now collaborating to get a new Department of Indiana Heritage to achieve the first major
                    change in state government in the heritage and history field for thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: We have an opportunity here, with limited resources in the state, to
                    consolidate under one department reporting directly to the governor on all historic functions at the
                    state level. We could collaborate better with one entity. The governor's office, under
                    Governor O'Bannon, spent a lot of time with their personnel department looking to see where
                    functions overlap, where there could be changes. Progress has been made, but I understand this has
                    been going on for five years. I'm a member of a special commission that the governor
                    established to look into greater collaboration, and it needs to be regenerated. There's
                    still a chance for a public/private partnership that would not only save the state money but would
                    serve the citizens of Indiana better.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: Right now there are seven divisions, agencies, and departments scattered
                    through state government, and I firmly believe that by consolidation we're going to get
                    greater efficiency and cost savings, and we're finally after thirty years going to raise
                    the level of importance of heritage and culture in this state.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: It says to the rest of the country that we're really serious about our
                    history.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: That's not something new. Other states have done this. I think this
                    consolidation would be a cost saver but we're having a hell of a time, frankly, with the
                    bureaucracy. There is a resistance to change. DV: I would say that is something inherent in being
                    Hoosier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: No, it's inherent in being bureaucratic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: This new Indiana Department of Heritage really gets us excited. Then there
                    would be the opportunity for Sal to talk to someone who has direct access to the governor about the
                    state archives; likewise, it would give me an opportunity to improve our program of protection of
                    state property. Now, state property that's historic is not being adequately protected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: We could work better together. We presented a plan to the Historic Commission
                    that we're both sitting on to build a building for the state archives in the IHS parking
                    lot. We cannot legally own the archives because they belong to the state. They are state papers. But
                    we would, under a management contract with the state, manage the property. We could jointly put up
                    the building and do private fundraising with state money. And as Alan January, the acting director
                    of the archives, said to me, "You've got all of the infrastructure in this
                    building already set [so] that we would not have to duplicate it in the new one":
                    auditorium, food service, a gift shop, classrooms, and exhibition space. What we would maintain here
                    are the valuable papers of Indiana, going back before statehood, that are now in a very vulnerable
                    warehouse on the east side of <placeName>

                    we've got to convince the powers–that–be at the state level that a
                    new building is imperative.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: What both of you are saying is that you're really focusing on the
                    issue of historical advocacy. Preservationists have been very active and historians really have
                    never done that.</p>

            <p>THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC HISTORY IN INDIANA</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Historians don't predict the future, but what do you see for the
                    future of history and historic preservation in Indiana? We've already talked about your
                    desire to develop this new state department, but what else do you see and what you would like to
                    see?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: I would like to see more public access, and that's a thing
                    we're working on very strongly here. In the past, generations of librarians and historians
                    were not willing to share information, and I'm seeing a nice change in that area.
                    Technology is helping us provide more access. We're digitizing many of the images in our
                    collection so you can pick them up on the Internet. I also think that we need to strive for more
                    diversity in the field, other people's history rather than history as we have done it in
                    the past.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">RW</hi>: We're starting to see political platforms that include historic
                    preservation, call it revitalization or whatever name the political party or candidate wishes to
                    use. We couldn't say that twenty years ago because we were thought to be a
                    frill—something nice, but not necessary. I think we've overcome that to a large
                    degree, and now I would like to see us <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-100-2-071"/> be able to affect the
                    political process. I'd like to see political leaders use the words "historic
                    preservation" in a bold and aggressive way, so as not to hide historic preservation behind
                    community revitalization, and do so in local, state, and national election campaigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: One of the words we've not used in this whole discussion is
                    "elitism." Both of our organizations—nationally, regionally, and
                    locally—have been tagged by that word. But both groups have moved away from it because
                    we've embraced other populations. We've gone from the elite to the popular, and
                    that's important.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: And do you see that coming from both external and internal sources?</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">SC</hi>: Yes. Museums had to change in the '80s as they became more democratic
                    and experienced a large infusion of state, local, and federal money. The result was to open their
                    doors to all. I know a lot of museums resisted that, but it was a good thing for the more staid,
                    musty institutions. Now we're in the next generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="b">DV</hi>: Thank you both.</p>

            <p>Operas are usually premiered in metropolises famous for their theaters; sometimes in a city with a
                    major university or a music conservatory; but almost never in a high school auditorium in a small
                    city possessing none of these cultural amenities. Yet on June 10, 1949, the opera <hi rend="i">Ouanga</hi>, with music by classical violinist and composer Clarence Cameron White and libretto
                    by scholar and writer John Frederick Madieus, was given its first fully staged performance at

            </p>
            <p>The event takes on a greater historical significance because the music and words were written by
                    African Americans, and because the local group who performed the premiere, the Harry Thacker
                    Burleigh Music Association, was made up almost entirely of black Hoosiers. Understanding the history
                    of this association helps to explain why such a musical event occurred in such an unlikely place.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Taking matters into her own hands, very shortly after arriving Mrs. Curtis founded the Harry Thacker
                    Burleigh Music Association.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Her vision for the group was
                    wide–ranging: she sought a vehicle for African Americans to bond through music and
                    theater, and to give blacks who had studied music a performance venue. She also wanted to let the
                    larger community know that the spiritual was not the only form of black music. Curtis wanted to
                    demonstrate that music was universal, that it had no ethnic boundaries, and that all music could be
                    sung and enjoyed by anyone who wanted to delve into its riches.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lorene Richardson, a former member, recalls the association this way: "The Burleigh (as we
                    called it) was the only [black] community group in the city (or the state), the sole purpose of
                    which was to perform music. [In addition to people from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>], we had members from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Gary, and Niles, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>." She also noted that the group instilled a professional demeanor in its
                    members. "Those who participated in [the Burleigh] learned the basic protocol of performing
                    artists; punctuality, dependability, sense of ensemble, stage movement, and decorum."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A significant number of pieces in the group's repertoire came from the genre of operetta.
                    This was distinctive because most black vocal performance groups in America during this period
                    focused on opera, oratorio, mainstream choral literature, and African–American folk

            <p>Reviews of these productions have not been located, suggesting that there was little or no press
                    coverage for the first years of the association. The group had to prove itself a viable artistic
                    entity. Had the association not reached a level of maturity and quality that commanded attention
                    from the press, far fewer records would be available to researchers.</p>
            <p>The local newspaper began to send a reporter and to run reviews of association performances in 1947,
                    with the production of Bedrich Smetana's opera, <hi rend="i">The Bartered Bride.</hi>
                    George Maurer wrote in his review titled "Bartered Bride Charms Crowd" that
                    "[t]he cast was competent, well chosen, and the chorus was unusually well
                    balanced." <hi rend="i">Bohemian Girl</hi>, performed in 1934, was mounted again in 1948.
                    "Burleigh Group Does Well by Balfe's Gay Work" is the headline of Frank
                    G. Schmidt's review "The choral work in this production is highly commendable
                    … sprightly and cheerful. …</p>

            <p>Each fall the association presented a concert featuring art songs, arias and choruses from operas and
                    oratorios, standard choral literature, and various genres of folk music. An opera or operetta was
                    presented every spring.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> An examination of cast lists reveals that the group
                    maintained a nuclear core of singers for major operatic roles throughout its history. Both the 1947
                    and 1948 operas, for example, listed twelve soloists; of these twelve, eight singers starred in both
                    productions. There was also a stable group of choristers and supernumeraries. This created a
                    repertory–company atmosphere with high standards for every production. These factors were
                    key in the association's growth and stability and helped to maintain community, media, and
                    philanthropic support.</p>
            <p>At the center of the Burleigh's success was a triumvirate: founder Curtis, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> Ward Bryant, and James Lewis Casaday. It was their collective effort that made the
                    association a cornerstone of the performing arts community.</p>
            <p>Curtis came to her position as founder of the association with a performing arts background, academic
                    training, and a history of social activism. She grew up as a part of the black middle class, was a
                    1927 graduate of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                    restricted time for blacks in the Midwest in general, and Curtis's willingness to brave a
                    white university and a white music conservatory indicates the same spirit of activism that prompted
                    her to found the Burleigh and to work, throughout her life, for the arts, better housing, and racial

                    pianist and accompanist, she was at the forefront of all the group's activities. Bryant

                    being an insistent advocate for what she believed to be "good music." Association
                    alumni recalled Mrs. Bryant as being highly skilled, uncompromising, and a real advocate for the

                    </placeName> in 1938 to serve as director of dramatic arts for the city's school system.
                    Association papers indicate that he became part of the Burleigh's staff shortly after his
                        arrival.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Casaday was the only white staff member at the Burleigh. In addition to suggesting the
                    director's own liberal–mindedness, his many years of work with the black music
                    group would seem to indicate its high level of quality. Casaday, like Curtis and Bryant, insisted
                    that members learn and maintain professional standards of work and conduct. As Lorene Richardson
                    recalled, "Much of what was learned about the discipline of being performing artists
                    happened through the work of Mr. Casaday."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>If the Burleigh Music Association had never staged a premiere of an important American opera,
                    musicologists would still record that the organization was significant and worthy of research. The
                    premiere of <hi rend="i">Ouanga</hi>, however, elevated the Burleigh to a new level of distinction.</p>
            <p>The 1949 premiere was, for both composer Clarence Cameron White and librettist John Frederick
                    Matheus, the culmination of a journey that began in 1924 when White became head of the music

                    Oberlin Conservatory. He was already an experienced teacher, an accomplished violinist, and a
                    published composer. Matheus (1887–1983), a graduate of Western Reserve University and <placeName>

                    </placeName> University and a professor of romance languages, came to the college in 1922. The young
                    academic was interested in Haitian culture and was also a published and prize–winning
                    short–story author. As the two men developed a close professional relationship, White
                    came to share Matheus's interest in <placeName>

                    Negritude, which grew out of, among other sources, the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, was for many

                    heritage and culture. The movement looked to the cultural forms of the French Caribbean as sources
                    for recovering African beliefs and practices, and thus in the 1930s and 1940s many black artists,
                    musicians, and writers began to <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-100-2-078"/> study <placeName>

            <p>Grants from the Rosenwald and Harmon foundations, along with a monetary award from the college that
                    White received for musical achievement, financed a 1928 summer of study in <placeName>

                    based on the island's history and folklore. Once there, Matheus plunged even more deeply

                        <country reg="ht">Haiti</country>
                    </placeName>'s culture. White searched the island for folk music to use as a basis for the
                    opera's score. He was already deeply familiar with spirituals and had published violin and
                    piano compositions based on that musical form. While he found nothing like the spiritual in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ht">Haiti</country>
                    </placeName>, White did discover what he described as a "strange, weird sort of rhythm
                    running through the Voodoo rituals." "It was," he later recalled,
                    "a new and different rhythm and I studied it until I had mastered it. … That
                    rhythm is the basic rhythm in 'Ouanga' and it is authentic."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> and the college. He completed the opera's libretto in 1929. White, with an
                    extension of one of his fellowships and a study leave, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> for two years to study operatic composition with Raoul Lapara and to finish work on the

            <p>As White moved further into the score of the opera, his compositional plan that had been established
                    with Matheus—to create an opera based on Haitian history and musical
                    forms—became more far–ranging. White wanted to "produce an opera
                    entirely for and about Negroes," believing that such a work had heretofore not been
                    composed. "There is a native dramatic ability in the Negro and deep wells of music within
                    him," White said, and he expressed the belief that these qualities inherent in black music
                    would make Ouanga a success.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> White did not intend to produce an opera that
                    could be performed and enjoyed only by black artists and audiences. He wanted, rather, to use the
                    cultures of the African diaspora in the same way that white European composers had utilized their
                    own cultural identities in creating the existing French, German, Italian, and Russian schools of
                    opera.</p>

                    awarded to an opera in English by an American composer. Previous medalists included Charles

                    speculation. Association alumni, interviewed many years afterwards, could not recall any prior
                    acquaintance between Josephine Curtis and Clarence White. It may be, however, that the two musicians
                    already knew each other through one or more professional associations. The composer was instrumental
                    in the founding of the National Association of Negro Musicians and served as its president from 1922
                    to 1924. During that <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-100-2-081"/> same period Curtis was active in the

            </p>
            <p>Even without personal associations between the composer and the group's founder, in the
                    context of 1940s American race relations White's choice was understandable. There were no
                    major opera companies to which a black composer could submit a new work and expect both serious
                    review and a real chance at being included as part of the repertory. The sole exception at the time

                    to change the culture of his people into one similar to the French court of Napoleon. Christianity
                    and the traditional religion of voodoo come into conflict, and the two philosophies vie for
                    dominance on the island, eventually bringing the death of the emperor's beloved, Defilee,

            </p>
            <p>White had chosen the soloists for the major roles. The starring roles of the emperor and Defilee were
                    played by native Haitian singers Fritz Vincent and Carmen Malibranche, but many of the other

                    The principal conductor of the performances was Zigmont George Gaska, a well–known
                    conductor from the region; White conducted the overture and one of the opera's two

                    He felt that the work was an orchestral gem but was unkind to singers. The critic also pronounced,
                    however, that both the orchestra and the singers had met the demands of the score. He concluded by
                    declaring the performance a resounding success.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

            <p>Alumni of the Burleigh, interviewed in 1995, were still excited when they reminisced about
                    "their premiere." They talked about the vocally challenging writing in
                    White's score and the level of concentration required to perform in a fully staged,
                    full–scale production of a grand opera. Lorene Richardson added that this "was
                    the first time that we performed an opera with full orchestra." Alumni also recalled the
                    stimulation of performing in the presence of the opera's composer and librettist.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Great music often draws on diverse sources and great musicians typically defy categorization. The men
                    and women who redefine the form and content of the musical genre in which they work often live
                    "before their time" and are recognized only at the end of a long career or after
                    death.</p>
            <p>Scores of well–known Indiana musicians have made significant contributions to the world of
                    music. Fans of jazz will recognize the names of Wilbur and Sidney DeParis, horn players from
                    Crawfordsvflle; Speed Webb, band leader from Peru; and Sid Catlett, drummer from <placeName>

            <p>Far less known to jazz lovers is the name of Belford C. "Sinky" Hendricks,

               </figure> Why then, is he still relatively unknown? One reason is that Hendricks often worked behind
                    the scenes as arranger or conductor. But just as important, much of the music that he wrote and
                    arranged defies easy categorization. As a promotional piece released for the Mercury Records album
                        <hi rend="i">Belford Hendricks and Orchestra</hi> said of him: "He's at ease
                    in many musical settings." With a background in jazz and the blues, he could perform and
                    write swing music for the big–band sound of the Count Basie Orchestra, but he could also
                    create a lush, pop sound for singers such as Dinah <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Nat King Cole.</p>
            <p>As a music lover, I was surprised that I had never heard of Hendricks until a casual conversation I
                    had with his nephew, Jeffrey Bibbs, Sr. This soon led to longer, more serious talks with Bibbs and
                    his mother, Belford's sister Dorothy Hendricks Bibbs. As a result of those conversations, I
                    began to organize the materials and stories that Jeffrey and his mother provided to me.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Below I offer a brief biographical sketch of Hendricks, an account of some of

            <p>Hendricks was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1909 to parents Frank and Melissa. In 1924, at age 15, he graduated from
                    the town's segregated Douglass High School and enrolled at the Indiana State
                    Teacher's College in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1920s Indiana, state schools were the only higher education open to most black
                    students. As a non–scholarship student from a family of modest means, Hendricks was
                    unable to live the life of a traditional four–year student. He worked nights and weekends
                    and had to sit out some semesters for lack of funds. Whenever possible, Hendricks made money playing
                    piano with local groups in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He also found it necessary, however, to supplement that income by teaming with his
                    friend Walter Bean to work for his meals at the Elks Lodge and Mother Eaton's Restaurant in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>In the early 1930s Hendricks began to spread his musical wings. He played with the Paul Stewart band
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In his hometown, he played for white audiences at the New Yorker club and at the
                    McCurdy Hotel, where he also worked as a bus boy. Hendricks also played in black <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> clubs such as the Shangri–La and the Casablanca. In 1935, he finally
                    graduated from college with majors in science and music. Fellow students remembered Belford for a
                    song—"Zoom, Zoom"—which was always on the tip of his
                        tongue.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After college, Hendricks left Indiana to enroll in an adult education program at <placeName>

                    during the Depression, coupled with the many hours Hendricks spent pursuing his educational and
                    professional goals, put a strain on the marriage; the couple remained together for more than a
                    decade, then separated.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Belford's service in the Army during World War II brought him opportunities to meet and
                    perform with artists who visited military camps to entertain the troops. His contacts with the
                    musicians he accompanied— among them, singer and actress Lena Home—proved to
                    be of great value in his later career.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the war Hendricks and his wife resettled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The city hosted an active music scene during the late 1940s, and Hendricks was a major
                    contributor. His piano playing graced the stages of several clubs and hotel lounges, but he could
                    switch to another instrument when necessary. Walter Bean later recalled that "He
                    … could play just about any instrument." Hendricks also developed a reputation
                    by playing on local radio shows, including "The Breakfast Club" and
                    "Toast and Coffee."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all of this exposure, however, Hendricks was forced to supplement his income by working as a mail
                    carrier. Engagements were too inconsistent, and pay from musical work was never enough to support
                    himself and his family. Belford and Mayetta divorced in the late 1940s. Seeking new opportunities,
                    Belford moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City in 1950 to pursue his musical career.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hendricks discovered that he was already known to many musicians in the city by word of mouth,
                    despite his relatively anonymous midwestern career. Through early connections, Hendricks was able to
                    secure a spot on the Arthur Godfrey talent show, a launching board for many entertainment careers.
                    But luck deserted Hendricks when he reached the studio. He was told that his chosen and
                    well–rehearsed selection was too similar to that of another contestant and that he would
                    have to perform another piece of music. Under pressure, Hendricks played well but did not win the
                        competition.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    member of the group and sat in for him during vacations and illnesses. Thus Hendricks was able to
                    play with the orchestra on several occasions, and his working relationship with Basie led to a
                    writing collaboration between the two men, the result of which was the 1954 album <hi rend="i">King

            <p>As Hendricks's career continued, he was increasingly called on for his breadth of expertise
                    as a composer, arranger, and conductor. He became such a prolific composer and arranger that he
                    often used pen–names to avoid competition among his own tunes. The name he used most
                    often was Bill Henry, but he also used variations such as Belford Cabell Hendricks, Sinky Hendricks,

                    </placeName>'s success with Hendricks's arrangements points to a key feature of
                    his style: he was what today would be called a crossover artist, not only because his talents were
                    wide–ranging and his musical styles capable of such variation, but because his work
                    lacked a specific racial identification at a time when music was still often marketed to racially
                    distinct audiences. Another artist who benefited greatly from this aspect of Hendricks's
                    style was vocalist Brook <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName>, with his soothing and easily recognizable voice and a suave manner that captivated
                    audiences, was particularly successful at capturing the emotion in Hendricks's music and
                    used it–for example, with the Hendricks–Otis–<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> song "It's Just a Matter of Time"—to cross from
                    the rhythm and blues to the popular music charts. Sung by black and white performers, purchased on
                    albums, performed in clubs, the music Hendricks wrote and arranged crossed the barriers of a
                    segregated society.</p>
            <p>Hendricks continued to write music throughout his career, but by the late 1950s his reputation as an
                    arranger began to compete with his status as a composer. Hendricks also tried his hand at producing
                    an album, <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Hendricks's most frequent collaborator was Clyde Otis, director of music at Mercury Records.
                    Other frequent coworkers were band leaders Jimmie Lunceford and Sy Oliver, and vocalists

                    famous singers. Among his hits as an arranger are: "Our Waltz" (Sarah Vaughn);
                    "A Mother's Love" and "Runnin' Out of Fools"

                    and many other artists, often led to his own later lack of recognition. A 1995 remixed CD of eight <placeName>

            <p>The musical charts of the 1950s and 1960s, however, offer ample evidence of Hendricks's wide
                    influence on the music of his time. His collaborations with Dinah <placeName>

            <p>Hendricks was so highly regarded by many in the jazz and pop music world that he was even called upon
                    to remake one artist's singing style. Music critic John Chintala relates the story of how
                    Al Martino, a successful recording artist from the 1950s onward, wanted to change his voice to sing
                    in a quieter and more restrained way. On the recommendation of Nat Cole, Martino worked with Belford
                    Hendricks. From their collaboration, and with a musical arrangement by Hendricks, Martino recorded
                    "I Love You Because," which rose to number three on the Billboard popular music
                    chart in 1963.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Musicians today continue to hold Hendricks's work in high regard. I interviewed Alonzo
                    "Pookie" Johnson, well–known saxophonist with Jimmy Coe, Wes <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>, and the Ink Spots. After he reviewed Hendricks's record of accomplishment, he
                    was impressed by both the breadth and depth of his work. He contended that, having written and
                    arranged music for so many top–level performers, Hendricks must be considered one of the
                    best in his field.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After an interview with Jimmy Coe, composer, arranger, saxophonist, and band leader, I was even more
                    convinced that Hendricks was indeed a significant contributor to the worlds of jazz, rhythm and
                    blues, and popular music.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Coe, who played with the Jay McShann and Tiny

            <p>SOURCE MATERIAL AND SELECT DISCOGRAPHY</p>
            <p>Hendricks composed over 100 songs during his lifetime and arranged scores of tunes for orchestras,
                    small groups, and individual performers. More than half of the songs were co–written;
                    some appeared under his pseudonym, Bill Henry.</p>
            <p>Very little has been written about Hendricks. Most standard music encyclopedias, whether about
                    popular music, blues, or jazz, yield little or no information on his life and career. Much, however,
                    has been written about many of the musicians with whom he was affiliated. Searching the biographies
                    and autobiographies of these individuals will yield useful results.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Hendricks's songs have survived because his music was not faddish; it did not cater to the
                    moment. When Johnny Mathis or Frank Sinatra sings, "Call me, don't be afraid to
                    just call me,"; when Dinah <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> sings, "What a difference a day makes, twenty–four little
                    hours"—we feel that they are headed for a place we all know. Our hearts and
                    minds are engaged by the music. Perhaps one day Belford Hendricks will receive the recognition he
                    deserves for music which has become an intrinsic part of so many people's lives.</p>

            <p>The image of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., linking arms with fellow marchers often dominates popular
                    memory of the civil rights movement. It cannot, however, represent the rich variety of means African
                    Americans pursued to achieve social justice during the mid–twentieth century. <hi rend="i">Sister of the Solid Rock</hi> reminds readers that the struggle for equity can start
                    with one individual reaching out to nurture the promise of others.</p>
            <p>Edna Mae Barnes was born into a southern migrant, poor, working–class family mat settled
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early 1900s. After high school, she met and married Earl Martin, and they
                    enjoyed family life in the growing African–American middle class. Edna Mae was inspired
                    by worsening conditions in her Martindale neighborhood to help the community's children.
                    She started a Christian daycare program with two children and an apartment rented with her household
                    money. Throughout the 1940s the program struggled, unable to draw needed funding from the
                    economically challenged community it served. Martin's independence had alienated many
                    leaders in local African–American churches, and so when a few local white Baptist
                    churches offered assistance, Martin joined with them and formed the East Side Christian Center
                    (ESCC).</p>
            <p>During the 1960s, the ESCC continued to grow and to gain more affluent white donors—in
                    particular the Lilly Endowment. Martin, in her sixties, began to raise funds for a new facility and
                    took on greater administrative responsibilities. By 1965, the facility, built in the heart of the
                    Martindale community, catered to the needs of a broad variety of citizens, from parolees to teen
                    mothers. Martin had neither the time nor, more <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-100-2-097"/> importantly, the
                    inclination to march for civil rights. Wilma Rugh Taylor argues laboriously that Martin sympathized
                    with many of Dr. King's goals but believed that serving and loving people would do more to
                    eradicate the world's ills than civil disobedience and marching. The center's
                    reliance on conservative white Baptists and businessmen for funding also meant that Martin could not
                    have endorsed die civil rights movement, even had she wanted to, without considerable risk to the
                    ESCC's finances. Illness finally forced Martin to leave her beloved center, and she died in
                    1974.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the author never offers a deeper analysis of the complex racial, gender, and class
                    issues that created tensions between Martin and the board of the ESCC. Taylor does recount some of
                    the discrimination Martin faced when fundraising in small towns and <hi rend="b">rural</hi> areas
                    across Indiana in the 1940s and 1950s, and she conveys a sense of the tightrope Martin walked trying
                    to balance the needs of the center's clients, the demands of its white benefactors, and her
                    own faith–based vision.</p>
            <p>Overall, this biography succeeds in making Martin's achievements and actions as noteworthy
                    as those of more familiar civil rights leaders. While the book lacks breadth in its choice of
                    sources and would have benefited from an understanding of African–American
                    women's grassroots activism, it shines a light on <hi rend="b">a</hi> life worth

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana Historical Society Press, 2003. Pp. xxix, 481. Illustrations, appendices,
                    notes, bibliography, index. $29.95.)</head>
            <p>In this first biography of singer, songwriter, and comedic actor Paul Dresser, Clayton W. Henderson
                    provides an engaging and enlightening account of his subject's life and times, with an
                    emphasis on the culture of 1890s popular song. Dresser is a challenging subject for a biography
                    because, unlike his more famous younger brother, the writer Theodore Dreiser, he left few personal
                    records behind. There seem to be no diaries or autobiographical accounts, and only a few letters.
                    Any chronicle of his life depends upon contemporary sketches in newspapers and magazines and <hi rend="b">a</hi> few reminiscences of friends, most appearing long after Dresser's
                    death. The most detailed accounts of Dresser's personality appear in his brother's
                    works, chiefly the sketch "My Brother Paul" (Twelve Men, 1919) along with a few
                    essays about die 1890s song business. All are refracted through the haze of the younger
                    brother's hero–worship for Paul and his simultaneous <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-100-2-098"/> disdain for sentimental music. As a result of this dearth of primary
                    materials, Henderson devotes much of his account to sketching the context of American popular song,
                    providing a fascinating and illuminating history of patent medicine showmen, black–face
                    minstrel troupes, vaudeville entertainers, and the business of music publishing.</p>
            <p>Born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1858 to German immigrant parents, Paul Dreiser, Jr. was the oldest of ten
                    surviving children. In a childhood marked by poverty and privation, he learned to play the piano,
                    picking out tunes by ear, but never learned to read music. His father, a devout Catholic, wanted
                    Paul to study for the priesthood, but after only a few months at St. Meinrad Seminary in southern
                    Indiana, Paul decided against becoming a priest. He left home at age fifteen to play piano with a
                    traveling medicine show; throughout his teens he worked with patent medicine sellers and in minstrel
                    shows. By age twenty he had published his first song and anglicized his name to Dresser. In 1895 he
                    published "Just Tell Them You Saw Me," the song that was to make him famous,
                    followed in 1897 by the wildly successful "On the Banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Far Away," now the state song of Indiana. At the height of his celebrity,
                    Dresser achieved wealth and enjoyed friendships with leading <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> stars. He was the silent partner of a music publishing firm, Howley Haviland &amp;
                    Co., and its magazine, <hi rend="i">Ev'ry Month</hi>, which his brother Theodore edited.
                    But when his sentimental ballads of home and mother fell out of favor with the advent of ragtime,
                    Dresser fell into a rapid and pathetic decline, dying at age forty–seven in 1906 of
                    complications caused by obesity, alcoholism, and depression.</p>
            <p>Henderson's decision to relegate his discussion of Dresser's songs to a section
                    following the biography is problematic. He did so to allow "the reader who cares little
                    about the workings of music to spend most of his or her time in the
                    life–and–times portion of the book and to dip into the song section only when
                    interested" (p. xviii). While the author acknowledges that the disadvantage of such
                    segregation is to separate discussion of the songs from their biographical context, the result is
                    that the reason for Dresser's importance becomes obscured. There is little discussion of
                    Dresser's developing craft or why his songs captured the public interest; indeed, Henderson
                    quotes comparatively few lyrics. Even the discussion of "On the Banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>" depends on a paraphrase of the song lyrics. Henderson appears to assume
                    discussion of Dresser's music would put off readers, but most readers of a biography of a
                    songwriter will be interested in the connection of the music to the man.</p>
            <p>Perhaps because of the dearth of detail in the record, the strength of the biography is its rich
                    portrayal of the culture of popular song and its biographical sketches of medicine and minstrel
                    showmen, thoroughly documented by Henderson's scouring of historical records. For these

            <p>This volume presents, in alphabetical order, approximately four hundred entries on individual
                    authors. Each entry begins with name, birth and death dates, and major pseudonyms, and continues
                    with sections on biography, literary significance, identification of major works, and suggestions
                    for further secondary reading. The entries are signed and include the institutional affiliations of
                    some one hundred contributors, all members of the Society for the Study of Midwest–em
                    Literature, the projects sponsor. This volume is the first of a proposed three for the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Midwestern Literature.</hi> Volume two, in encyclopedia–entry format,
                    will cover important historical and research sites, movements, themes, and genres; volume three will
                    be a discursive, chapter–organized, literary history of the Midwest.</p>
            <p>The author entries are prefaced by general editor Philip A. Greasleys introduction, outlining the
                    definitions and organization of the content, and by an overview essay, "The Origins and
                    Development of the Literature of the Midwest," by David D. Anderson, a founder of the
                    society and a prolific contributor to its enterprises. Both essays attempt to define the
                    geographical and intellectual boundaries of the project, to fix the term "Midwest"
                    and so to clarify the principles of inclusion and exclusion. Neither piece, however, successfully
                    identifies the difference between "Midwestern authors" (that is, persons with

                    literature." This ambiguity has implications for the usefulness of the volume. Who is
                    represented here, and on what basis?</p>
            <p>Andersons essay, for instance, concludes with the intriguing note that four of the eight American
                    winners of the Nobel Prize in literature are midwest–erners: Sinclair Lewis, Ernest
                    Hemingway, Saul Bellow, and Toni Morrison. By geographical and cultural affiliation and by attitude
                    these four belong in this volume. The situation is less clear for other figures who also appear:

                    especially helpful in directing the reader to the author's writings and from there to an
                    acquaintance with the secondary scholarship. The chosen authors comprise an effective selection,
                    from historically significant figures like Booth Tar–kington, Carl Sandburg, Kurt
                    Vonnegut, and Aldo Leopold, to promising newcomers like poet Jonis Agee and novelist Nettie Jones,

            <p>The publication of <hi rend="i">Karl Bodmer's Studio Art</hi> coincides with the 200th
                    anniversary celebration of Lewis and Clark's expedition. Although thirty years lapsed
                    before Prince Maximilian of Wied–Neuwied and his hired Swiss artist, Karl Bodmer, arrived
                    in America to document flora, fauna, and Indian cultures, data from Lewis and Clark's
                    journey still provided guidance and inspiration. At the Peak Museum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the prince viewed natural and ethnographic objects gathered during the 1803
                    expedition. He later met with William Clark in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and received a gift of Clark's "Special Map of the <geogName>Missouri
                        River</geogName> in the years 1804,1805 and 1806."</p>
            <p>The book is divided into three sections. "The Eyes of Strangers: 'Fact'
                    and Art on the Ethnographic Frontier, 1832–34," by Joseph C. Porter, describes
                    Maximilian and Bodmer's voyage up the Missouri River from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>
                    </placeName>, and assesses the scientific significance of their work, placing it within the context
                    of the ethnographic philosophies of the time. Porter also details the pair's unexpected
                    delay in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> into the prince's "finishing school" for North American
                    exploration, while Bodmer spent his time drawing wa–tercolors and sketches of the
                    settlement and its vicinity.</p>
            <p>"A Publication History of Karl Bodmer's North American Atlas," by David C.
                    Hunt, traces where and when the lithographs were published and also includes research into the
                    artist's complex printing processes and methods of sales, and <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-100-2-101"/> his post–expedition life. Hunt's essay also
                    provides comparisons with other mid–century artists who were illustrating the zoology,
                    botany, and ethnology of North America. Readers interested in the history of Indiana will note the
                    inclusion of James Otto Lewis (1799–1858), who painted edinographic studies in the state.</p>
            <p>The third section contains mirty–two black–and–white and twelve
                    color reproductions of Bodmer's work (primarily from the Newberry Library collection in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>) with knowledgeable annotations by W Raymond Wood. Wood also wrote the introductory
                    essay, speculating on Bodmer's methods for transforming field sketches into completed
                    prints, outlining the background of the Newberry's collection, and evaluating the
                    artist's work.</p>
            <p>Compared with other artists who documented Native Americans in the mid–to–late
                    1800s, Bodmer's artistic quality stands alone. His depictions of human gesture and body
                    language demonstrate precision, talent, and sensitivity. Although hired as an illustrator, Bodmer
                    was trained in the finest European traditions, and the influence of Romanti cism is evident. The
                    print used for the cover of the book, for example, shows a Blackfeet warrior mounted on a refined
                    Arabian horse rather than a more realistic Indian pony.</p>
            <p>The book is well organized and nicely designed, with easy–to–use illustration
                    references. <hi rend="i">Karl Bodmer's Studio Art</hi> is a fascinating, meticulously
                    researched and documented examination of the most important period in Bodmer's life, both
                    artistically and historically The plates are carefully reproduced, albeit small, and give the reader
                    a clear idea of the artist's ability and aesthetic vision. Because the plates are almost
                    all figurative ethnographic studies, however, the book may appeal more to historians than to art
                    enthusiasts. As Wood laments at the end of his introduction, Bodmer continues to be venerated more
                    by historians and anthropologists than by art curators.</p>

            <p>Professors, planners, and journalists have written many volumes on urban renewal, but few authors
                    have tackled the subject of suburban renewal. In <hi rend="i">Halfway to Everywhere</hi> William H.
                    Hudnut, former mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, attempts to remedy this neglect and to examine what is being done to revive
                    America's first–tier suburbs. Hudnut defines first–tier suburbs as
                    those cities and towns closest to <pb n="203" id="VAA4025-100-2-102"/> the central cities that
                    developed before or immediately after World War II. These older suburbs are halfway between the
                    traditional hub of the central–city downtown and the booming edge–city
                    commercial centers along the metropolitan fringe. Though halfway to everywhere that matters in the
                    economic and cultural life of the metropolis, they are too often, according to Hudnut, ignored
                    territory, overlooked by those reporting on the gentrifying core and the expanding edge. Moreover,
                    they are too frequently forgotten by state and federal policymakers.</p>
            <p>With an evangelical zeal appropriate to a former clergyman, Hudnut has traveled throughout the nation
                    visiting a wide range of communities and discussing their problems with local officials and
                    activists. He brings good news from his travels: residents of first–tier suburbs are
                    fighting back and rebuilding their communities. He examines "city stalwarts" in
                    nine communities, leaders who are engaged in the good fight and making a difference. Then in a
                    series of chapters he discusses regional cooperation among suburbs in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> and northeastern <placeName>

                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName>. He also considers the relation of suburban development to mass transit initiatives,
                    the redevelopment of abandoned industrial property, the recycling of obsolete shopping malls, and
                    the efforts to revive suburban main street shopping areas. Hudnut does not neglect Indiana,
                    discussing economic development in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Carmel and praising the redevelopment of Fort Benjamin Harrison in Lawrence.
                    Altogether Hudnut offers insight and inspiration for anyone concerned about the fate of older
                    suburbs. He reveals what can be done and encourages suburbanites to do it.</p>
            <p>Readers should be warned of some problems with Hudnut's survey. He seems to assume that all
                    suburban communities developed before 1960 face major challenges and constitute a distinctive and
                    troubled class of metropolitan settlement. Yet, in fact, he examines a broad variety of communities
                    ranging from Bronxville—a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> suburb where the price of homes averaged $1 million in 2000—to
                    East <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, ground zero of America's urban catastrophe. Given
                    this great disparity, the concept of first–tier suburbs seems to have limited analytical
                    value and to obscure more than it reveals.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Hudnut ignores the degree to which some inner suburbs have never needed revitalization and
                    to which others have perpetually needed a boost. Some of the communities discussed have always been
                    gritty and others always glittering. Actually what is remarkable about many first–tier
                    suburbs is their stability. Unlike the fashionable avenues of Indi–anapolis's
                    near northside that went from riches to rags between 1900 and 1960 or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Euclid Avenue that fell from social prominence in a few decades, such
                    suburbs as Bronxville, Bexley, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Beverly Hills</settlement>
                    </placeName> were upscale when first developed and have <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-100-2-103"/>
                    retained their social standing and property values throughout their histories. The most depressed
                    first–tier suburbs are places like Camden and East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> that were from their beginnings working–class communities. Whereas many
                    central–city neighborhoods plummeted socially and economically during the twentieth
                    century, first–tier suburbs more often slipped or maintained their status. In 1950 urban
                    sages dismissed the inexpensive houses in suburban Long Islands Levittown as the slums of the
                    future. Fifty years later the homes had greatly appreciated in value and were solidly middle class.
                    One might well ask, then, why more of suburbia doesn't need sweeping renewal.</p>

            <p>This book is not the comprehensive survey that its title and appearance suggest. Instead, it is a
                    narrowly focused and often convincing argument for the predominant role of British precedent in
                    giving form to the domestic architecture of the cities, suburbs, and well–settled

                    design, recent discoveries and interpretations of canonic buildings, forms of urban expansion and
                    new town foundations, etc.—serve only to illustrate the author's principal
                    argument. Indiana (with only 45,000 of its 1850 population of just under a million living in urban
                    areas and barely 4,000 people in its two largest cities of <placeName>

                    </placeName>), like other trans–Appalachian lands, escapes notice.</p>
            <p>The author addresses "intellectual themes" through a wide array of literary
                    sources, principally ones addressing members of a growing middle class who sought to elevate
                    themselves to what they took to be the polite standing of their English counterparts. They abandoned
                    the Federal style founded on the practice of John Soane and embraced new fashions and ideas
                    identified as a "his–toricizing Picturesque." Epitomized by John
                    Nash's practices and made accessible by an abundance of easily transportable books,
                    particularly those of John Claudius Loudon, this "romanticism applied" held
                    Americans in its thrall even as it waned in Britain.</p>
            <p>Americans now fashioned their buildings and contiguous landscapes into picture–like
                    settings evoking various historical associations and providing settings suitable to their
                    proprietors' aspirations. A building had to possess an identifiable style: Egyptian, Greek,
                        <pb n="205" id="VAA4025-100-2-104"/> Tudor, Rustic, "Doric cabin," Gothic,
                    Oriental, Anglo–Italian, Swiss, or something else. If style were missing, Americans would
                    appear to lack the sophistication required to give their new nation standing in the world.</p>
            <p>In pursuing this argument, the author pointedly attacks the received wisdom that the period was
                    dominated by the Greek Revival and that this style was the authentic American style embodying the
                    nations democratic aspirations. The desire to exhibit a universally acceptable taste is what
                    influenced builders, not the pursuit of an authentic "American architecture."</p>
            <p>But American architecture was distinctive. It made much more, for example, of the porch than did its
                    foreign sources. The author devotes a long chapter to the difficulties of interpreting that
                    difference. Further, Americans converted imported styles based on lithic construction into wooden
                    buildings, although this characteristic waned rapidly at the end of the period, when stone and iron
                    became easily available. And the newer American buildings were generally
                    well–constructed, although illustrations from photo archives reveal that in general
                    nineteenth–century America was very scruffy. Ramshackle buildings in unkempt urban
                    settings crowded in upon the few large, high–status, solidly constructed, and
                    well–designed treasures in the canon of American architecture (usually, and valuably,
                    seen here in various states of incompletion or demolition). These pictures suggest what this world
                    really looked like, and they contrast sharply with the ideal images from pattern books and
                    elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Fourteen scholars have contributed to this interesting overview of the experiences of
                    African–American troops in the Civil War era. The essays cover a wide variety of topics,
                    ranging from accounts of individual battles to the lives of the officers and enlisted men who
                    constituted the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Colored Troops (USCT).</p>
            <p>Editor John David Smith begins the book with a long essay which describes in broad terms the
                    creation, organization, and experiences of black Americans in the USCT. Four other essays review
                    battles, from small skirmishes to large clashes. For example, in his account of the battle of Port
                    Hudson, Lawrence Hewitt recounts the creation of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Native Guards, their absorption into the Union army, and their performance <pb n="206" id="VAA4025-100-2-105"/> in the battle. Two of the essays focus on the killing of black
                    prisoners by Confederate troops. In another essay, Michael Meier describes how Adjutant General
                    Lorenzo Thomas recruited and organized many of the regiments. Noah Trudeau provides a history of the
                    long–neglected seven black cavalry regiments. The last four essays address other aspects
                    of the central topic. In his examination of Thomas Higginson, James <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>, and Robert Shaw as regimental commanders on the coast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Keith Wilson explains how their backgrounds and views of the war shaped the way they
                    employed their black soldiers. Edwin Redkey describes how Henry M. Turners experiences as one of the
                    few black regimental chaplains began his distinguished career as a religious leader. Robert Zalimas
                    focuses on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where clashes between white and black occupation forces presaged the problems that
                    blacks civilians would face in Reconstruction. The final essay, by Richard Reid, explores the impact
                    of war experiences on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>'s black soldiers. Adding to the overall impact, the work contains a number of
                    excellent battle maps, photographs, and line drawings.</p>
            <p>Unlike many volumes that focus almost completely on battles or on race relations, this collection of
                    essays presents the many different facets of African Americans' Civil War experiences. This
                    is both its strength and its weakness. Readers expecting to get a complete treatment of the black
                    military experience in the war will not find it here. On the other hand, readers will find that this
                    volume is a good introduction to the variety of experiences of African–American members
                    of the Union army and to the impact that the Emancipation Proclamation had on the war, on blacks,
                    and on whites. All of the essays are based on extensive research in a wide range of primary and
                    secondary sources. Many of the authors have crafted well–written and interesting essays,
                    going beyond the information provided in traditional military records to try to provide some insight
                    into the lives of the soldiers. Reid's essay is particularly intriguing for his attempt to
                    trace the soldiers through the post–war era to assess the impact of the war experience.
                    On the odier hand, Meier's piece on Thomas displays the weaknesses of some of these essays.
                    Because of its limited lengdi, the author is able only to partially explore the process of raising
                    and organizing USCT regiments. Its very brevity leaves the reader seeking more information on a very
                    complex process. Overall, however, the essays provide a good introduction to die complex issues
                    surrounding African Americans' military contribution to die goal of attaining freedom
                    during die Civil War.</p>

            <p>In these two ample essay collections Paul A. Cimbala and Randall M. Miller bring together a
                    substantive new array of sources on the Civil War, supplementing a growing series on the North
                    published by Fordham. If the collections are a bit uneven, each essay is well researched and
                    thoughtful, drawing on multiple traditions of historical research, from political to social to
                    cultural, as well as on varying sources of evidence ranging from advertisements to letters,
                    newspapers, diaries, and memoirs.</p>
            <p>While the title of <hi rend="i">An Uncommon Time</hi> stresses the idea of the Civil War as a decided
                    break from the past, the essays themselves suggest both continuity and change. In her fine piece,
                    "A Monstrous Doctrine? Northern Women on Dependency during the Civil War," Rachel
                    Seidman argues that women not only used the well–established ideal of women's
                    economic and emotional dependency on men for the greater good of their families (to argue that their
                    men be released from service, for example), but that they also resisted it in new and old ways,
                    through petitions, strikes and unions.</p>
            <p>Essays range from an analysis of the media and popular culture of the Northern home front to the
                    politics of religion, partisan wrangling, the effects of the war on national institutions (the
                    Smithsonian) and policies, the Confiscation acts, and the federal system of war claims. One
                    particularly fascinating piece concerns the tycoon Jay Cooke and the ways he reconfigured patriotism
                    through his national War Bond drives. "Cooke's accomplishment," Melinda
                    Lawson argues, "was the creation of an alternative definition of loyalty: an accessible and
                    profitable version of national patriotism, rooted in a liberal understanding of citizenship as the
                    pursuit of self–interest, even in times of war" (p. 105).</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Union Soldiers and the Northern Home Front</hi> concerns primarily the members of the
                    armed forces and their interaction with those at home, following the recent work of scholars such as
                    James McPherson and Reid <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Somewhat narrow articles on mobilization in local communities open up to a more
                    expansive section on the war itself. The book closes with essays that move into the postwar era.</p>
            <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-100-2-107"/>
            <p>Some of this collections most unusual articles illuminate both the unexpected adaptations that the
                    war forced upon the Northern populace and the ways Northerners ultimately resisted die consequences
                    of change. In a lively essay, "Listen Ladies One and All': Union Soldiers Yearn
                    for the Society of Their Fair Cousins of the North," Patricia Richard explores
                    advertisements placed in local newspapers by lonely soldiers looking for some way to meet
                    respectable women with whom to correspond, flirt, and, potentially, marry. The war, she argues,
                    disrupted romantic trajectories, and slowed or barred peoples ability to start families. Here was a
                    way in which people worked to overcome obstacles to their futures.</p>
            <p>In a very different but just as successful article, David Cecere analyzes the racial ideologies that
                    white Northerners carried with them to war, and the ways these were challenged by new relationships
                    and experiences. "The force of daily encounters with—or at least observations
                    of—blacks eroded and modified Yankees' two–dimensional racial
                    notions," Cecere finds, "thereby blending the image of a comical,
                    simple–minded, even subhuman African American with more complex racial models, the nature
                    of which varied from one New Englander to another" (p. 323).</p>
            <p>Certain articles challenge long–standing assumptions about the war in provocative ways. In
                    "We Are All in This War': The 148th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> and Home Front Dissension in Centre County during die Civil War," Carol
                    Reardon illuminates the ways that community values —in this case conservative and
                    Democratic—persisted throughout die war, undercutting any shared sense of national
                    purpose. Michael Bennett also analyzes a constituency that resisted the norm in "Saving
                    Jack: Religion, Benevolent Organizations, and Union Sailors during the Civil War." Rather
                    than the religious dedication attributed to soldiers of the Civil War era, Bennett finds both active
                    and passive resistance to piety, even among sailors faced with death daily— from the
                    elements as well as the Confederates.</p>
            <p>In short, gems are found throughout these collections. As material on the North has grown the
                    historical landscape has changed, with die result diat we now have a more nuanced and insightful
                    history of the war than the polemics of the past gave us. Cimbala and Miller are to be commended for
                    adding to that work.</p>
