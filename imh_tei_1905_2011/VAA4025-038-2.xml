            <p>The richness of American imagination was documented by a young diarist who described the composition
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>'s early population by enumerating as many as eight popularly conceived types
                    of frontiersmen. They included Yankee, Hoosier, Yorker, Yahoo, Buckskin, Buckeye, Chegoe, and
                        Sucker.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Long familiar in the American tradition and long taken for granted,
                    such stereotypes are encountered wherever one turns.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The mere enumeration of
                    these popular terms does not imply their qualitative parity, since they varied widely in their
                    vividness and in popular acceptance. The Hoosier symbol, which was used to indicate the distinctive
                    culture imputed to Indiana, not only stood out from other western folk symbols, but was the nearest
                    rival to the Yankee folk creation in vitality and in general acceptance.</p>
            <p>The degree to which a stereotype justly reflects the characteristics of a people or a region raises
                    fascinating but treacherous questions. Perhaps a historian should avoid a topic in which hearsay,
                    fancy, small talk, and even slander are the principal raw materials. The Hoosier stereotype might be
                    dismissed as a piece of subjectivism were it not for striking parallels to objective fact. Not only
                    did Indiana receive a smaller proportion of the foreign-born than other states of the Old Northwest;
                    but migration from the great northeastern Yankee region through the plausible <placeName>

                            some years ago by Walter Lippmann in his <hi rend="i">Public Opinion</hi> (<placeName>

                    Thus, ascription to Hoosiers of a compound of traits derived from the southern uplands appears
                    relevant to early Indiana's predominantly southern population. The popular notion that
                    Indianans were a fever- and ague-ridden race was matched in objective fact by an ill-drained and
                    swampy terrain. Flippant treatment of Hoosiers in the secular press is probably related to the
                    frustration acknowledged by eastern religious workers who tried to make Puritans out of Hoosiers, as
                    well as to the lack of enthusiasm of eastern migrants for Indiana destinations. The relative
                    isolation of Indiana, the slowness of Yankee cultural penetration, and a deficiency of accurate
                    knowledge in eastern minds concerning Indiana must have had their bearing.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the oral transmission of the stuff of folklore and popular
                    clichés—rumor, idle talk, anecdote—one can say little except to
                    recognize its eminent importance and deplore its loss, a loss which emphasizes present dependence
                    upon manuscript and printed evidence. Recorded evidence of the Hoosier stereotype falls into general
                    classes: journalistic quips, and, particularly conspicuous, a crude sort of newspaper feature which
                    for convenience and because of its special character may be called the "Hoosier
                    story."</p>

                                <p>Whether a wet terrain is especially productive of folk-types is a query suggested by
                                    a seventeenth-century reference to the English fens: "A

                                    describes the inhabitants of the peat fens of Cambridgeshire as 'a kind of

            </p>
            <p>While the full-length Hoosier story, which even a tolerant critic would pronounce a generally low
                    literary form, might fill most of a column of a newspaper, there was no standard length. To what
                    extent these stories or references, over fifty of which appeared in <hi rend="i">Yankee Notions</hi>
                    in something over a decade, were original with that periodical would be difficult to determine. Some
                    of them are clearly borrowed, since a reader recognizes them in prior sources. That certain stories,
                    copied and recopied in widely remote parts of the country, remained current for years is also
                    quickly evident. How brisk was the traffic driven by journalists in floating stories of this general
                    type was remarked a century and a quarter ago by Hezekiah Niles who said that a single mail brought
                    five or six copyings of a story on the tantalizing theme "How Lorenzo raised the
                        devil."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes direct, sometimes vague and oblique, often coarse, insipid and pointless, Hoosier stories
                    appear to be a journalistic innovation intended to ridicule a type of culture which was antithetical
                    to that of the Yankees. It was probably not accidental that a periodical founded to epitomize the
                    Yankee genius of humor so promptly seized the Hoosier type as a way of lampooning a contrasting way
                    of life. And it is perhaps not accidental that the Yankees chose the neutral ground of the Old
                    Northwest as the place of deriding a way of life derived directly from the South. Literary history
                    thus augments the broader records of cultural adjustment in emphasizing the Yankee and the Hoosier
                    as outstanding native folk-types of nineteenth-century America.</p>

            <p>As the portrayer of a comic strip must constantly invent situations to preserve the momentum of his
                    creation, so did the anonymous purveyors of the Hoosier myth fancy their principal in a series of
                    exploitable situations. Thus one finds, in addition to stories in which details of person or of

                    and the Hoosier at the circus, at fisticuffs, or on the stage. Also too good to be overlooked was
                    the bringing together of stock characters: the Hoosier with the Yankee, the Irishman, the Frenchman,
                    the Jewish peddler, or the dandy. He was pictured as making a ridiculous public wager with Dan
                    Marble, the circus man, or as impudently heckling Jenny Lind during one of her performances.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Among the few stories which attained a truly entertaining level is the one which concerned a Hoosier,
                    "an ugly man," wrongly believed by a group in a grocery store in

                    nerves with a drink. As the nerve-shaken one raised the tumbler to his lips there was hilarious
                    laughter at the grotesque homeliness of his features. "He's hardly got over
                    bein' blowed up yet," implored the host reprovingly. "Less make up a puss
                    for him." After a purse of sixty-five dollars had been raised it became known that the
                    homely man from Indiana had actually been at a distance of several hundreds of miles from the
                    exploding boiler.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>Also relieved by the touch of a gifted raconteur was the story called "The Ager
                    Candidate," which stemmed from the political career of the Honorable Joseph A. Wright,
                    Governor of Indiana at mid-century. Re-elected, the Governor held open house. Among the callers was
                    an oldish farm wife from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName>, which county was described in the story as being a noted fever and ague district.
                    Singularly happy in her compliments to the Governor, the farm woman assured him: "They
                    needn't run any man agin you, Governor, down in our region of the country; we believe in
                    you—we do!" The Governor was grateful but surprised, and assured the admiring
                    guest that he hoped to be faithful to party and to public trust. But the rustic woman was not
                    through. She did not care about party and public matters: "You go ahead and make your
                    Indian vegetable ager pills, and we'll gin you a majority down our way, party or no

            <p>Withal, the literary traffickers in the Hoosier folk-type did not drive too hard a bargain with the
                    figure they purveyed. No weakling, his roistering courage in physical encounter belied his
                    supposedly debilitating environment. The Hoosier's sense of humor salted many a story.
                    Although the Hoosier might be "green to the highest degree of verdancy, ignorant and
                    awkward, and attired in the acme of flashy bad taste,"<hi rend="sup">14</hi> he was likely
                    to prove "quite as sharp as city folks."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> After making fun of
                    the Hoosier's appearance, with his "little head perched on a crane's
                    neck," and exposing him to embarrassment and humiliation, the narrator often permitted his
                    rustic principal to come off victorious by means of a crashing verbal broadside. Thus the Hoosier,
                    baffled by the intricate menu of a first-class hostelry, at length exclaims: "Bring on your
                    soup, and <hi rend="i">then I'll pitch into biled vittles</hi>. Yeou tax all the same, they
                    say, and it's hard choos-in'—so I'll just try one plate
                    through the lot; I will, <hi rend="i">ef I bust."</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">16</hi> Even in such
                    heavy-handed stories as the one in which the Hoosier, too terrified or stupid to leap to the clear,
                    is chased a long distance by a steam locomotive and finally plunges to the implausible safety of a
                    swill-barrel, the victim is allowed to proclaim triumphantly: "Now here I am, a real
                    double-revolving snoly-gloster, ready to attack anything but a combination of thunder and lightning,
                    smoke, railroad iron and hot water."<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> may be called the mother of humble southern folk types. Here was Colonel
                    Byrd's "lubberland." Here was the colony which had suffered commercially
                    and socially from standing between rich and haughty neighbors; a commonwealth accustomed to
                    disparagement by travelers and journalists; whose natural advantages were said to be slightly
                    appreciated at home and little respected abroad—the latter probably caused by the former,
                    thought Hezekiah Niles.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> From thence was reported the same sort of religious
                    and social landscape which distressed and baffled the sons of the Puritans in southern Indiana and

                    long tails—long-tailed ones would knock off the huckleberries chasing foxes and rabbits;
                    one never saw a man or boy with buttons on his pants; they used pegs—wore the buttons off
                    climbing for persimmons.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Prom these reasons one may suggest a special

            <p>While there is little mystery as to why stereotypes make their appearance, the course of their
                    development is not always simple. Why, for example, did a stereotypic tag fix itself on southern <placeName>

                    </placeName>, "<placeName>
                        <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
                    </placeName>," as a region, while in the case of Indiana "Hoosier" was
                    more nearly personal and state-wide in what it connoted? Why did the Hoosier stereotype develop
                    greater vividness and persistency than other western folk symbols? To what extent is any stereotype,
                    once formulated, self-perpetuating? One may hazard that any regional stereotype is the resultant of
                    numerous circumstances: of physical realities which determine lines of communication and which exert
                    a selective influence, positive and negative, upon migrations; of geographical and social
                    information and misinformation; of desire to have human situations reported in the slashing strokes
                    of caricature. Once formulated, these accretions of fact and popular fancy must have been largely
                    self-propelling, for people are loath to surrender their legends. Upon the pictures called up by
                    these impressions starved imagination could feed; upon them creative imagination could build.
                    Yankee, Hoosier, Yorker, Yahoo—merely to recite the names is to risk being captured by
                    their rhythm.</p>
            <p>A query which occurs at this point concerns the extent to which faithful reporting of the Indiana
                    scene was prevented by the influence of a fixed image in the minds of the reporters; in other words,
                    did witnesses insist upon finding in Indiana what the cliché promised? For upon this play
                    of subjective influence would depend much concerning the reputation of the state and its people.</p>
            <p>For example, it would be interesting to know the extent to which the English Captain Blane, who
                    traveled in the state, allowed the hearsay of the steamboat deck and the taproom to color the
                    statement in his book, published in <placeName>

            <p>If only itinerant foreigners and unacclimatized outlanders had reported a distinct social milieu in
                    Indiana it might be suggested that they were misled by limited opportunity for observation. But
                    those from nearby, who presumably should have been more familiar with Indiana, also reported a
                    peculiar mode of Hoosier life as well as a process by which outsiders became naturalized to the
                    environment. This appears from a letter of one I. N. Bereman, who wrote back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> telling about his new wife, Ann Ferguson. As her husband described her, she was an old
                    maid of thirty-two years, both homely and poor, possessing a character without blemish; a Baptist,
                    and a Kentuckian by birth. But, careful to place his wife in a good light with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> relatives, the bridegroom explained: "She had been but 4 or 5 years in the

                    Although they are not of great aid in estimating the weight of subjective influence, these preceding
                    examples show the forthrightness of bona fide references which lie close to the stereotype.</p>
            <p>Nor is the problem much clarified by the close parallel between fanciful and supposedly serious
                    writings. This parallel, often evident, may be illustrated by two bits of composition which appeared

            <p>Thus, one may take his choice between serious and fanciful accounts; the impression he would gain of
                    Indiana's society and environment would often be about the same in either case. It is
                    little wonder that fantastic ideas of Indiana's landscape prevailed in many minds long
                    after the geography and society of her neighboring states had become by comparison an open book.
                    Something of the lightness with which easterners carried their knowledge of Indiana's

            <p>Perhaps an investigator of the future will analyze the process by which the sharp light of
                    understanding penetrated the vapors which obscured Indiana's society. Even the assiduous
                    editors of <hi rend="i">Yankee Nations</hi> eventually tired of stories of legislators too ignorant
                    to wind a watch or of congressmen-elect who set out in the wrong direction for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, since in the last three or four volumes of that serial the number of Hoosier stories
                    is negligible. It would be interesting to know the time of appearance and the amount of credit due
                    the several "normalizing" forces—infiltration of new stock, the
                    building of railroads and highways which have helped Americans to know how their neighbors live, and
                    the social uniformities induced by the machines. A clue to the substantial changes that were taking
                    place by the middle of the 1850's is the note appearing in an Eastern paper that
                    "of the ninety-one counties of Indiana, the inhabitants of eighty can leave home in the
                    morning, go to <placeName>

                    would doubtless find also that the drainage renaissance, noticeable about 1850, and coming to a new
                    phase of effectiveness about 1880, was of cardinal importance.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>Yet in spite of ameliorative forces, literate outlanders surrendered the Hoosier stereotype with

                            "second girl" and when she comes to fill the drinking pitchers she rattles

                            of the cistern. Someone said once it was because she'd had the chills so much, but
                            when the question was asked her she answered: "No, mem; but I had the ager off

                            pitchers she turns a shade bluer, and exclaims, in a thin, indigo tone, "Granther

                            "reds herself up a bit." She jerks one shoulder and says she came

                    solace that Indiana was distinctive enough to generate a robust stereotype. It is to be hoped that

            <p>Few congressional campaigns in Indiana have been more interesting, or more bitterly fought, than
                    those in which Schuyler Colfax and David A. Turpie were the nominees of the rival parties in 1862,
                    1864, and 1866. During that period Colfax of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> was one of the most popular Republican leaders, not only in Indiana but in the country
                    as a whole. Even before his election to Congress he had attained a state-wide reputation as the
                    publisher of a leading Whig newspaper, the <hi rend="i">

                    </placeName> tide, Colfax was re-elected successively until his nomination for the vice-presidency
                    in 1868. Rising rapidly to a position of influence and leadership in the party and nation, he served
                    as a speaker of the house for three successive terms in the turbulent years 1863–1869.<hi rend="i">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The political opponent who gave Colfax his stiffest competition was his three-time rival, David A.

                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>

                    by 1862 already become a prominent leader in the Democratic party in Indiana. As evidence of this,
                    the fact may be cited that when he ran for lieutenant governor in 1860 the understanding was that in
                    the event of party success Thomas A. Hendricks, the candidate for governor, would be elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    successful in that campaign, he attained a few years later a still higher office—that of <placeName>

            <p>The setting for the contests between these two party leaders was in the hectic period of the Civil

                    politics seriously; indeed, it has been said that they talk politics for two hours after they <list type="footnotes">

                    of the Civil War and Reconstruction, when emotions were deeply stirred, political campaigns were not
                    pink tea affairs.</p>
            <p>In July, 1862, Colfax, the sitting house member from the ninth district, arrived home from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to give the first account of his legislative activity since the outbreak of the war.
                    Earlier in the year there was a rumor to the effect that he would seek appointment to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate to fill the unexpired term of Jesse D. Bright, who had been expelled. But Colfax
                    informed Governor Morton that he was not a candidate for the position.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> It
                    seems, too, that he was giving some thought to the possibility of securing a cabinet position. His
                    friend, Horace Greeley, advised him that if the cabinet "is to be a strong, energetic,
                    driving, fighting Cabinet, go in! If not, stay out!"<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Whatever may have
                    been the reason, Colfax was not appointed.</p>
            <p>The way was therefore open for the renomination of the congressman. The district Union convention,
                    meeting at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> on July 24, renominated him by acclamation. Addressing the convention Colfax praised
                    the national administration and pointed out in particular the abolition of slavery in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="dcu">District of Columbia</country>
                    </placeName>, and the passage of the homestead and confiscation acts. He added that the President
                    had given him and others a pledge that henceforth the war was to be prosecuted in earnest. In this
                    and other campaign speeches Colfax made his appeal to all Union men and endeavored to make his cause
                    identical with that of the Union.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> As his former competitors for Congress were
                    all either in the army or on the stump for the Republican candidate there was apparently some
                    justification for this position.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colfax entered the campaign with the feeling that the odds were against him. The failure of the North
                    to effect striking military victories against the South brought about a reaction among northern
                    people which affected political contests. Many also felt that the enlistment of voters in <list type="footnotes">

                    party. For a month before the canvass got under way Colfax, in carrying out a promise made to
                    President Abraham Lincoln, went on a speaking tour in his and other districts to encourage
                    enlistments in the army. In his own county of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> he offered to give ten dollars to each of the first fifty volunteers who enrolled after
                    the offer was made.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> His great success in this respect caused him to have some
                    misgivings politically. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The volunteering is terrible on us politically; &amp; I fear the State is lost by it. At
                            first it seemed impossible to get any one to go; but my meetings in this District [his own]
                            were immense, the largest I ever attended; this enthusiasm got up to fever heat; &amp;

            </p>
            <p>Another reason for Colfax's misgivings likely was the fact that the Democrats had selected
                    to run against him one of their strongest and most popular men, David A. Turpie. Colfax's
                        <hi rend="i">Register</hi> referred to Turpie as "a Democrat of the
                    Voorhees-Vallandigham school, and as such will never receive the endorsement of the loyal voters of
                    the 'Bloody Ninth.' "<hi rend="sup">10</hi> Turpie invited Colfax to the
                    usual joint discussion of the political issues, "especially of the civil policy of the last
                    Congress of which you was [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] a member.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The challenge was
                    of course accepted. Fortunately for the student of that period, Turpie has left his own account of
                    those stirring times.</p>

                    <p>These joint meetings were held at all the county-seats and at many other places in the more

                        violated and the crowd around us became so dense as to be oppressive. The whole time of the

                        this order alternated from day to day.</p>
                    <p>These meetings were well attended, two or three thousand being a not unusual audience. They were
                        often held out of doors in the woods, quite distant from railway lines…. Such was the
                        intense and eager political feeling of the time that no account was taken of the weather. On
                        several occasions we addressed large crowds of men and women standing in the rain….
                        The care and precaution of the committee of arrangements for the preservation of order were
                        heartily seconded by the audience and by the candidates. For although we were conducting a
                        canvass in the very face of those bitter strifes and animosities engendered by the existence of
                        a civil war, my competitor and myself both intended that no social war should result from our
                        controversies.</p>
                    <p>Both parties united in preparing the platform for the speakers, and seats for the audience. The
                        main stand was always decorated with the national flag, with wreaths of cedar, green boughs, and
                        garlands of wild flowers—the goldenrod and the asters, white and blue. Very little
                        money was spent in these decorations. They might be today accounted cheap and trivial, yet they
                        were real tokens of respect for the occasion, part of the manner and custom of the time.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    usually began his speech with a plea for the Union. Nevertheless the Republicans, including Colfax,
                    endeavored to cast suspicion upon Turpie's patriotism. On one occasion Colfax, while
                    speaking, attempted to embarrass his competitor by turning abruptly toward him and remarking that if
                    he was such a devoted friend of the Union he should shoulder his musket and help fight its battles.
                    When his turn to speak came, Turpie replied that he was "entirely willing" to do
                    so, but was <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Another incident which Turpie recorded indicates the resourcefulness of the zealous partisans of that
                    day. In a debate at a railroad junction Turpie discovered in his opening speech that a locomotive on
                    a switch near-by had a great deal of whistling to do about the time he wanted to make his points
                    "pungent and apposite." At first he thought this was accidental and made nothing
                    of it. But when his voice was drowned out, with increasing frequency, by longer and louder
                    interruptions than before, he began to perceive that a game was being played at his expense. His
                    observation of signals being passed between the engineer in the cab and persons near the stand
                    confirmed his suspicions. While he was waiting in embarrassment, the chairman of the Democratic
                    county committee came and advised him to go on and pay no attention to the disturbance; as he would
                    make the matter "right and satisfactory." Turpie accordingly finished his remarks
                    and gave way to Colfax. After the latter had warmed up to his subject and had reached one of his
                    highest flights another engine which had been brought onto the switch "commenced and
                    continued a deafening discharge of blasts and blowing." Colfax stood aghast but smiling.
                    There had been a change of politics in the engineers! Colfax continued despite the disturbance of
                    this "Democratic" locomotive. After it left the debate was concluded without
                    interruption. As the speakers left the stand Turpie asked his competitor how he liked the new method
                    of applause by steam. Colfax replied that they had "carried the matter too far, entirely
                    too far."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The outcome of the election was the usual victory for Colfax, but by the smallest margin in his
                    entire congressional career. His official majority was 229.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Turpie in fact
                    carried more counties than did Colfax. The latter knew the battle would be close and was prepared

                    Colfax himself subscribed to this explanation. Soon after the election he wrote to Senator John

                    played their part in the reaction. The Democrats heatedly denied, however, that Republican reverses
                    could be explained by the absence of most of the soldiers and even claimed that Democratic gains

            <p>It was fondly hoped in the North, of course, that long before the next election occurred the war
                    would be brought to a victorious conclusion. Such was not to be the case. The chief concern of
                    Congress in the intervening years therefore continued to be the prosecution of the war. Union

                    Grant's losses in the Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor brought no rejoicing.</p>
            <p>As the campaign of 1864 approached it was certain that issues connected with the war would again be
                    stressed. President Lincoln was renominated and the Democrats selected as their presidential nominee
                    General George B. McClellan, who was to run on a platform which called for a cessation of the war.</p>
            <p>According to a letter published in several <placeName>

                    congressional term.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> This announcement was received with regret by his friends.
                    Many of his constituents wrote to him to that effect, and the delegates at the Republican (Union)
                    state convention from the ninth district asked him to reconsider the matter. In March, Speaker
                    Colfax replied that after a thorough reconsideration of the whole question he felt that he ought not
                    to desert his post if his constituents insisted otherwise. His determination to retire "was
                    only changed in consequence of the critical condition of the district politically, from the absence
                    of so many thousands of its voters in the field." If in public life at all, he said, he
                    preferred to represent the ninth district to any other position in the government.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> This letter left his renomination by the district convention a mere formality.</p>
            <p>David Turpie—"Dirty Dave" or David "Turpitude" some of the

                    already chosen him as its candidate for lieutenant governor. The Democratic district convention
                    asked Mr. Turpie to accept the congressional candidacy instead, because, as they thought, he was
                    defeated in a very close race "by fraud and trickery" in 1862. The Democrats
                    thought the indications were that Colfax would be buried so deep politically "that he will
                    be beyond redemption by special ressurrection [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]." Faced with the
                    necessity of choice Turpie turned down the nomination for lieutenant governor. His great ambition in
                    life, as reported, was "to lay Schuyler Colfax upon the shelf." That done, he
                    would be ready like Simeon of old, to say: "Lord, let now thy servant depart in peace, for

                    together with the fact that northern military prospects still looked none too bright, worried Colfax
                    in the early part of the canvass. "It seems to me," he wrote, "as if a
                    draft in Sept. would lay us out."<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Later, again noting the bad effect

                    </quote>He pleaded for a delay of the enforcement of the draft and urged that as many soldiers as
                    possible be allowed to return to vote.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> He likewise urged the immediate arrest
                    of the Grand Commander of the Sons of Liberty in Indiana. "I defend," he
                    continued, "the 'arbitrary arrests' out &amp; out on the stump as you
                    will see, &amp; it is the most popular of all." Colfax enclosed a report of one of his
                    campaign speeches to show the President how Colfax was urging his constituents to stand by the
                        government.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> In September he joined Governor Morton and others in sending a
                    letter to Secretary Stanton in which they asked for an informal delay in the enforcement of the
                    draft which was to occur on the eve of the Indiana election, and urged the return of soldiers for

                    "most heartily the policy of confiscating the property of rebels voluntarily in arms
                    against their country," and praised the administration for striking at slavery,

            <p>Turpie took his cue from the resolutions adopted by the district convention which nominated him.
                    These declared the war to be the "legitimate result of the teachings and blasting

                    abolition the resolutions declared it to be "a disastrous failure" and recommended

                        <p>Doubtless it is the duty of men of all parties to support the government engaged in the

                            different thing from saying that all citizens should dissolve their party organizations,
                            surrender their political convictions and unite in electing a president and members of both
                            houses of Congress wholly of the same party. Such a unity would only lead to an unchecked,
                            unchallenged system of in-competency, corruption and oppression. Minority and majority
                            parties are, in a free government, necessities as useful in time of war as in peace. An
                            administration happening to be in power is not the government. The government of this
                            Republic is worth more than this administration or any other and will outlast them. This was
                            our position; it was openly taken and upheld and it was never relinquished or abandoned, not

            <p>As noted above, the prospect for the Republicans at the outset of the campaign looked none too
                    bright. But in September, northern military prospects, and incidentally Republican hopes, materially
                    brightened with the fall of <placeName>

                    and the Republicans the victory was a godsend. Colfax also, of course, shared the joy of these
                    brighter prospects. It is likely that he would have won without the <placeName>

                    successful in the October election, as was the state ticket, an outcome which pointed to victory for
                    the national ticket in November. His margin of victory this time was 1,680, which was considerably
                    larger than in 1862.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

            <p>In a letter to the district Republican convention Colfax declared that the contest was as vital as it
                    was in 1862 and 1864. He declared the issue to be: "Which shall govern in the Councils of
                    the Nation, Loyalty or Disloyalty?" He vigorously defended congressional reconstruction and
                    said it was necessary to uphold Congress in order to avoid a second rebellion. He rejoiced that his
                    party had been "so faithful, so inflexible, in what it has regarded as the pathway of Duty
                    and of Right." The resolutions adopted followed the tenor of this letter.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>The resolutions of the convention which nominated Turpie condemned the high protective tariff, Negro
                    suffrage, which was scented in the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, the freedmen's bureau
                    bill, the civil rights bill and the raising of millions of dollars in taxes for the
                    "education, clothing and protection of the African race at the expense of the white
                    taxpayers of the country." They apposed also the adoption of amendments to the constitution
                    "in a time of high political excitement and when one-third of the States are deprived of
                    the right of representation." The resolutions further declared that the southern states
                    were never out of the Union, and favored the "immediate admission of loyal representatives
                    to seats in Congress from the States lately in rebellion." The convention sympathized with
                    "all legitimate efforts of our Irish fellow citizens to liberate their native land from the
                    oppression of seven centuries."<hi rend="sup">51</hi>

                    administer justice to these law-breakers. He pointed out also how the House of Representatives,
                    "in which we have an overwhelming majority" passed a resolution which asked the
                    President to release the Fenian prisoners "whom he had himself taken and locked up in jail
                    on our side of the line." But it grieved him to say that the resolution had not yet been
                    acted upon by the President. "And here today stands General O'Neill with the bonds
                    of the President of the <placeName>

            <p>Colfax was elected vice-president in 1868 and his name was frequently used in connection with the

                    renominated and in March, 1873, he retired from office under the cloud of the Credit Mobilier

            <p>Many years after the smoke of the political battles of Colfax and Turpie had cleared away, Turpie,
                    while reminiscing in the mellow years of his old age, set down in his <hi rend="i">Sketches of My

            <p>As the impartial student looks back over these Colfax-Turpie campaigns with the perspective of the
                    intervening years he can see that neither person and neither political party had a monopoly on the
                    truth. Though some questioned his patriotism during the Civil War, it can be seen today that Turpie
                    and most of his fellow Democrats were also American patriots who had honest differences with the
                    party in power as to methods of procedure. As regards the tragedies of the Reconstruction period,
                    history has adjudged the position of Turpie more nearly right than that of Colfax.</p>

            <p>On the irregular floor of ancient ash boards in a house built of native stone gathered from the
                    fields surrounding it in southeastern Indiana stands my grandfather's clock. In that room
                    and another a few feet away across the hall it has stood for more than a hundred years. Before the
                    stone house was built it stood many years in a double log house with a similar hall through the
                    middle in almost the same place<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My grandfather was seventy years old when I was born.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> He then had lived in the
                    stone house and tended the clock as owner since 1831. He had wound it every night by lifting the
                    weights and pulling the cords through its intricate machinery. He had braided strands of flaxen cord
                    from time to time to replace the fifteen feet or more of weight cord. He had threaded this cord back
                    and forth from its "works" to a heavy weight that supplied its motive power, and
                    thence to the striking apparatus and back to a lighter weight. Occasionally he had oiled it. And
                    every year or so he had taken the clock from its case, removed the long flaxen cord and given the
                    brass machinery a thorough cleaning. If repairs were needed, he made them, as his father in early
                    pioneer days had done before him. This went on, while I watched him from time to time, through my,
                    childhood and early youth until his death at the ripe age of eighty-five. Thus he no doubt had
                    watched his father do in a much longer period before he inherited the clock and house. Finally he
                    rested with his parents beside the small stone chapel that when a bridegroom sixty years earlier he
                    had helped his father build in the western wilderness.</p>

            <p>Like the clock in the song, this great-grandfather's clock is more than seven feet tall. But
                    so far as I know, it-mever celebrated the arrival of a bride at its owner's home; and in
                    far more than a century it has kept up its ceaseless ticking, while one after another its owners in
                    succession have been carried away to the churchyard, followed or preceded by their wives and
                    numerous children.</p>
            <p>This clock was one of the first things I remember noticing. Its pendulum hangs on a wire more than
                    three feet long, so that it swings substantially once each second, with a resulting tick of grave
                    deliberation. In childhood I often listened to its voice as to someone speaking. Returning recently
                    to visit the clock, it seemed the ceaseless ticking was telling a story. I shall tell the story as I
                    know it from what I have seen and heard, and 'as the clock might tell it if it could speak.</p>

                    than a dozen years to acquire a family of ten children. Even before the tenth was born business
                    reverses at home and the beckoning promise of a new country in the New World across the sea drew him
                    to America. Lacking means to bring the family with him, he left them to the care of his brother,

                    there were markets beyond the sea, so business prospered. After he had been here two years, he sent
                    for his wife and children. To prepare ten children of ages ranging from one to fourteen years for
                    spending three months between the decks of a small ship which would pitch and toss with every wave,
                    and at the same time to pack the indispensable household goods for such a voyage and provide food
                    for the family while crossing, was no light task.</p>
            <p>That was thirty years before the first steamship crossed the ocean. It was twice as long before the
                    first Atlantic cable was laid. The ship they crossed in, like most ships of that time, was about 150
                    feet long and of a few hundred tons burden. There were no such monsters, 1,000 feet long of 40,000
                    tons burden, as have since been constructed. The inherited clock with its long wooden case was a
                    real problem. The brother, Edward, offered to exchange for it a new brass clock, without any case,
                    which he bought from the manufacturer ready packed in a cubical box of the smallest possible
                    dimensions. As these new "works" cost Edward ten pounds, the equivalent of
                    —50, when only the skilled mechanics received as much as —1 per day, while the
                    ancient family clock had little in its favor but sentiment, the offer was gladly accepted. The new
                    clock works were loaded on shipboard with a few household goods, the ten small children and their
                    mother, their own bedding and food enough for the voyage. This might by rare good luck be made in
                    four weeks but could (as it did) consume three months, depending upon the wind and weather and ocean
                    currents encountered. None of these had then been charted or studied until a generation later.</p>
            <p>To this point the clock's knowledge, like my own, is secondhand. It can only know what
                    happened then by having <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-038-2-044"/> heard about it from John Ewbank, Sr.,
                    and from his wife and numerous children; more especially from the son John, Jr., with whom it
                    afterward spent the last fifty years of his life, including those when he lived largely in the past.</p>
            <p>When it arrived on board the little ship, and with the other family possessions was stowed away in
                    the diminutive cabin between decks, the clock's opportunities were increased. It then had
                    time to look about, to listen and to gain information at first hand, as it has had ever since. If
                    only it could, it might tell much of real interest about the voyage, as well as the lives, loves,
                    toils, and homely adventures of the six or seven generations that it has watched pass by. For
                    great-grandchildren of its first owner now have great-grandchildren of their own.</p>
            <p>Scarcely were the mother and her ten children snugly ensconced in the few square feet allotted to
                    them of a small cabin built into a lower deck, when she became so violently ill she could only lie
                    still and be waited on by the children. In giving each of the larger ones a separate task, care of
                    the year-old baby was assigned to twelve-year-old John, the future owner of the clock. A brother
                    fourteen years old, another eleven, and one nine with his twin sister, and another sister almost
                    eight did what family work was done, and cared for another little sister and two still smaller
                    brothers, besides the baby.</p>
            <p>The mother continued to be violently ill whenever she ventured to leave her couch, so she was out of
                    the picture except as just another to be fed and cared for as an invalid. Fortunately all the
                    children were well and kept well all the way across the ocean. On clear days they would watch the
                    waves as their ship plowed through them, or perhaps see a school of dolphins at play, or the sea
                    birds flying over or perching in the ship's rigging or plunging into the water. In storms
                    they had to keep below with the portholes closed and nothing to see but the timbers of the ship,
                    their own small stock of household goods and similar possessions of their fellow passengers.
                    Refrigerators had not been invented, and even if they had been, would not have been carried on such
                    a small vessel. Ice in midsummer was not to be thought of. Canned fruits and vegetables were then
                    unknown on shipboard. After the first few days out of port, they settled down to a steady diet of
                    ship's biscuits, a kind of cracker, <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-038-2-045"/> with salted fish,
                    or even salted meat on special occasions, and a few dried vegetables like beans and onions. A
                    mouthful or two of lukewarm water quenched their thirst. Having food, drink, clothing, and shelter,
                    the children played and romped day after day and week after week, worrying little about what they
                    did not have. The younger children, and especially the smallest boy, Martin, three years old, were
                    much petted by the sailors. They carried him to explore every part of the little ship that to him
                    seemed so huge.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, and especially on Sundays, if their mother felt able to talk, the children would listen to
                    stories about the father who had gone away to far-off America two years earlier, before Rebecca was
                    born. Benjamin and Martin had been too small to remember him, and even Hannah, now six years old,
                    remembered only that somebody went away when she was too young to care very much about it. But all
                    were greatly interested now.</p>
            <p>These stories, with tales from the Bible, were about all in the way of diversion that was permitted
                    the children on Sundays. For this family, and especially the mother, were Methodists after the
                    strict measure of John Wesley, whose personal disciple she had been in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. One of the strongest articles of their faith was strict observance of the Sabbath, as
                    they called Sunday. For a child to play or sing or even laugh that day in the intervals between the
                    prayers and sermons that were hours long was strongly disapproved. On week days, however, each child
                    was free to play when his little tasks were done. Those too small for tasks might find entertainment
                    where they could, with only time out for eating and sleeping. When storms kept them between the
                    decks with the portholes closed and the big waves turned one end of the ship and then the other
                    toward the sky, a game could be played on the sloping floor of their small cabin. The little fellows
                    would slide across the floor as the ship tossed high on a wave, and turning, would slide back as it
                    pitched into the trough of the sea. Or on sunny days they would climb to the upper deck and visit
                    the steersman or the sailmakers, who never tired of hearing baby voices lisp the broad dialect of
                    Yorkshire.</p>
            <p>A hundred years of public schools and fifty of studying dictionaries have brought our common speech
                    to a uniformity not dreamed of when adjoining townships on either side of a <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-038-2-046"/> river or range of hills in Britain used entirely different names for
                    common implements of agriculture or household use. Saxon and Briton or Dane and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Norman</settlement>
                    </placeName> dwelling side by side for centuries had not achieved a wholly common speech.</p>
            <p>Wherever one is and in whatever circumstances, time moves on. Even packing the clock in a small
                    square box did not change this. One day thirteen weeks after it left <placeName>

                    </placeName>, this small boat with the large family aboard sailed into <placeName>

                    </placeName> Harbor and up to a wharf at the Battery. That great metropolis was then a town of
                    diminutive houses and unpaved streets. It was just beginning to bring water by wooden pipes from the
                    vicinity of what is now Fortieth Street to the more densely peopled lower end of Manhattan Island.
                    The rest of the city was still supplied by wells. The first successful steamboat in the world had
                    just begun operating on the Hudson between <placeName>

                    </placeName>, presumably at the Palisades or other high grounds, for I never heard any complaint
                    about the mosquitoes. John, the twelve-year-old boy-nurse, spent most of his time working in the
                    city of <placeName>

                    </placeName> is now, and looking down with scorn on mere countryfolk. John told in later life of
                    once seeing a lady with a sidesaddle ride a horse up <placeName>

                    doors and windows as she passed; though not many miles away, beyond the roads that led down to the
                    seashore and river landings, almost the only choice the people then had in traveling was to go on
                    horseback or on foot.</p>

                    </placeName> home the clock was taken out of its packing case and given a new upright wooden case of
                    wild cherry, that it still wears. During the next four years, it had nothing to do but tell the
                    minutes by pointing with one hand, the hours by pointing with the other, and by striking its bell
                    every sixty minutes, and telling the days of each month by the motion of a wheel on its face. The
                    children grew as other children have grown, went to school, and having learned to read, studied
                    about pounds, shillings, and pence, then still currently used in <placeName>

                    and sold cattle for every kind of money to be found in a seaport town, continuing to prosper in
                    spite of all.</p>
            <p>Tales were in circulation concerning the great Northwest Territory. It was said that lands had been
                    opened for settlement at places along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River which could be bought from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> for only two dollars an acre, payable in four annual installments. After the family and
                    the clock had been for four years near the North River, as the Hudson River was usually called,
                    their parents resolved to move to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River country. It was over fifty years since General Braddock's ill-fated
                    expedition against Fort Duquesne had opened a road from Cumberland across the mountains, which is
                    now <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Highway 40. It was nearly as long since the army of General Forbes had cut the trees
                    and brush from a roadway across the mountains on the present <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-038-2-048"/>
                    route of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Highway 30 from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. While these were little more than pack horse trails, neither graded nor paved, a
                    steady and rapidly increasing stream of travel was pouring west over them. Almost the universal
                    practice for emigrants from the northern seaboard was to travel by land across the mountains to some
                    point on the Conemaugh or Youghiogheny rivers, or some other of the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> large enough to carry a flatboat downstream, and from there to drift with the current
                    to the chosen destination. When the surface of the ground was dry, horses or oxen could travel ten
                    or twelve miles in a day. This left time for preparing and eating a breakfast cooked over an open
                    fire of logs, and for breaking camp; and, when the lengthening shadows in the later afternoon gave
                    warning, to camp again and prepare supper over other log fires in the same way. When it rained,
                    however, the wagon wheels would sink into the mud until the oxen and horses could go no farther.
                    Then there was nothing to do but to camp and wait for better weather, when the ground should become
                    dry enough that the wagon wheels could be dug out and the journey resumed.</p>
            <p>Little did that father and mother dream, while driving a few miles a day through the soft mud, and
                    sleeping in or beneath their wagons or on the bare ground under the trees, that fifty years later
                    their sons and daughters might ride at fifty miles an hour over substantially the same route on
                    railroad trains guided by telegraph messages; or that after another fifty years their grandchildren
                    could ride half that fast over stone turnpikes in gasoline buggies through a land of cities, towns,
                    villages, and farms in instant communication by telephone; or that after a few more years the
                    great-grandchildren and their sons and grandsons might drive in power-propelled carriages at
                    imperceptible grades on cement surfaced highways and through tunnels under the higher mountain
                    ranges instead of over them, at seventy miles an hour or even faster; or, if they preferred, might
                    float through the air high above the tops of the mountains, from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> City to <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> between a late breakfast and an early lunch.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that any such dreams disturbed the small children who played and ran and shouted
                    until they were tired and then climbed into the wagons to ride. The <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-038-2-049"/> parents and older children were kept too busy with camping and breaking
                    camp, preparing food, bringing firewood, cutting trees and underbrush that blocked the road,
                    harnessing horses and putting yokes on oxen, driving the wagons and unyoking the oxen, unharnessing
                    the horses and finding feed and water for both, to waste a thought on what changes the future might
                    bring, or on what their great-grandchildren and more remote descendants might do.</p>
            <p>The clock, having been placed in one of the wagons where it lay on its back with its face towards the
                    sky, had stopped. It was unloaded in the late summer near the bank of a shallow creek more than a
                    thousand miles from where they started, as measured by the route they had come.</p>
            <p>After entering the mountains, distance had to be sacrificed to elevation, and the wagons followed the
                    windings of streams day after day, forced to be content when half a day's travel around a
                    loop in the course of such a stream would carry them even a little nearer their destination, as
                    measured by the course of an airplane or even by the grades and cuts and tunnels which have since
                    been made.</p>
            <p>In the mountains there were long slopes so steep that the travelers had to "double
                    teams" in climbing them. They would leave part of the wagons and some of the family beside
                    the road, while all the horses and oxen tugged at a long chain drawing another wagon. Occasionally a
                    mountain was found so steep that they had to join their teams with the cattle of other emigrants to
                    get up at all. When at last the summit of a pass over the highest ridge of the Alleghenies was
                    reached, and far below lay the valley of the next river in a well defined channel enclosed by banks
                    on the western slope, another problem presented itself. How could wagons that had been tugged up so
                    high by the united efforts of several teams of horses and oxen be taken down again without
                    overwhelming the animals and rolling over or past them to certain destruction? These adventurers did
                    as others had done and continued to do until tracks for wagons at sloping grades were afterward dug
                    along the steep mountain sides from top to bottom. Felling a tree or finding part of one already cut
                    down by somebody else from which a log cculd be obtained, they chopped off the limbs several inches
                    from the log, which was then fastened behind a wagon as a drag or brake, plowing into the earth deep
                    enough that force <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-038-2-050"/> was required to pull the wagon with its drag
                    down the face of the mountain. Little regard was paid to roads in descending, but each driver dodged
                    between the trees as he could, and a helper followed with an axe to cut away any tree or bush that
                    might block progress of the wagon and its log brake.</p>
            <p>Not many days after they reached the foot of the mountains on the western side, they came to a river
                    large enough to carry flatboats. It was the Conemaugh that flows to the Allegheny and down it to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Here they found many travelers encamped, waiting for boats to float them down the
                    river. Some were trying to build their own boats. Many were awaiting the completion of boats
                    contracted for. Not a few were working for the boat builders while they tried to accumulate enough
                    money to buy or build for themselves. Flatboats already completed, however, could be purchased by
                    anybody with ready money, and our clock was soon on its way down the little river, together with its
                    owner and his numerous family, his horses and oxen, wagons, and all his other worldly goods.</p>
            <p>Outboard motors had not been invented. The first steamboat to go down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River was still in a boatyard at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>, half-completed. A loaded flatboat was too large and heavy for oars to be of much use
                    except to keep its bow headed downstream, and to guide it into the current or over to a landing on
                    the shore. Such boats floated with the waters of the stream. Sometimes they scarcely moved where the
                    current ran slowly. Again they speeded at four or five miles an hour around the long bends of the
                    river where the current was that swift. The distance traveled by water was much
                    greater—fully twice as great—as the distance by land in a direct line.</p>
            <p>Floating from dawn to dark each day, into the Allegheny River and from it down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, they tied to a tree on the bank each night. There was no channel save what the river
                    had made for itself, and no lights were on the shore to mark out the way. Books had been published
                    to guide flatboats, with maps which assumed to mark every sandbar and jutting rock or partly
                    submerged snag, and to tell just where the deepest channel would be found, throughout the length of
                    the river. These maps divided the river into short sections, and assumed to mark everything in it.
                    But they had to be interpreted, and collisions with other boats <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-038-2-051"/>
                    running faster or slower, or tied to the bank, or casting loose from it had to be avoided. With no
                    guide but their books and their eyes, each flatboat man ventured to pilot his own boat through
                    hundreds of miles of strange waters. As the river was constantly changing—much faster
                    than the guide books did—every statement in them was under suspicion. Almost any day a
                    tree undermined by the current might crash to the water and either lodge there as a new snag, or
                    float away to lodge at some other place. Wherever it lodged it might create not only one new
                    obstruction in the water, or many of of them, perhaps just below the surface, but might also dam up
                    the current and send it to a different channel. New sandbars could form overnight below the mouth of
                    a tributary stream after a hard rain. Piloting a flatboat called for daylight, sharp sight and
                    ceaseless vigilance.</p>
            <p>Ordinarily they floated thirty miles or more in a day, so that having driven three weeks through the
                    wilderness to the western side of the mountains, almost as much longer was consumed in floating down
                    a succession of rivers before they tied up at a little group of log huts where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> now stands. Venturesome descendants without the fear of traffic laws before their eyes
                    have driven the entire distance over automobile highways that now run from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> in one long summer day plus part of the night.</p>
            <p>Pushing back from the river along the valley of what was beginning to be called Tanner's
                    Creek, named for a trader whose two boys had been carried away by Indians twenty years before, the
                    clock's escort soon found two adjoining half-sections of land that suited them. These lay
                    across the valley on either side of the creek, forming together a square mile, just beyond the home
                    of an earlier settler who had gone deepest into the woods in that direction. A deserted
                    squatter's cabin, such as hunters and trappers had built for temporary shelter at many
                    places in the western woods, was near the north end of these half-sections on the bank of the creek.
                    Here the family spent the pleasant days of late summer and early autumn, when the clock was unpacked
                    and set up on the cabin floor.</p>
            <p>Another site half a mile farther down the creek, near the center of this embryo farm which reached to
                    the top of the ridge on each side of the creek, was chosen for a home. <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-038-2-052"/> The work of cutting logs to build a house and barn, and the clearing of
                    ground for a garden went forward in earnest. The four older boys were now aged from thirteen to
                    eighteen years, respectively, and the oldest girl, twin sister of the thirteen-year-old boy, passed
                    for a young lady. More than one of the girls who had come to the Northwest Territory in the
                    preceding twenty years, and some even as late as twenty years afterward, were married by the time
                    they were thirteen, though this girl waited another five years to marry. After being married, the
                    very young folks, like their elders, would begin housekeeping in a pen of logs, with a roof of
                    clapboards or "shakes," held in place by weight-poles laid across them. This
                    provided shelter whenever needed. At other times, however, domestic life, with its cooking, dining,
                    laundry work, soapmaking, grinding corn or sweet acorns for bread, and many other household
                    activities, was conducted under the trees in the open air.</p>
            <p>An intimation of what was then deemed necessary to comfortable home life in the woods is revealed in
                    a law that had been enacted in Indiana Territory in the year (1810) before they arrived. Besides
                    "necessary" books of the professional man and tools of the mechanic, few of whom
                    ventured into the deep woods, a debtor could hold as against an execution on a judgment in favor of
                    his creditors, "one milch cow and calf, one sow, one bed, bedstead and bed clothing, one
                    pot, one kettle, one dutch oven, one frying pan, and one axe."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The clock's companions, recently from Europe and the Atlantic seaboard, were not content
                    with bare necessities. Not satisfied with benches such as served for furniture in many frontier
                    cabins, they had chairs made by an English cabinetmaker who arrived in the settlement, some of which
                    are still in use at the residence. They built two structures of logs, each about sixteen by twenty
                    feet in size, standing eight or ten feet apart, and having provided for each a floor of split logs
                    or "puncheons" smoothed with an adze, near the ground and a like floor seven or
                    eight feet higher, they carried the logwalls up so as to form a loft that enclosed this second floor
                    above each of the lower rooms. Then they <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-038-2-053"/> boarded up the space between the log structures to make a
                    hallway both above and below. The lower hallway had doors at front and back of heavy oak planks
                    laboriously sawed out by hand. With a stone chimney and fireplace at that end of each room farthest
                    from the hallway, wide enough to hold firewood four feet long, they had a house ample for the family
                    of twelve. Together with a log summer-kitchen and the log barn and giant forest trees outside, it
                    was even capable of expansion to meet the extreme demands of backwoods hospitality. There were no
                    stoves until many years later, and all the cooking was done at open fires and on beds of coals in
                    the big fireplaces.</p>
            <p>Besides being the family home for twenty years this log building for half that time served also as a
                    chapel where the circuit rider preached when he came, and especially every Sunday when the
                    clock's master, as class-leader in the old Methodist sense, gathered his family and a few
                    neighbors together for inquiry, instruction, exhortation, admonition, and encouragement. Every month
                    or so, on whatever day of the week the circuit rider might appear, ail of the ten children would go
                    in different directions through the woods to notify neighbors whose children, in turn, would pass
                    the word on to others. "Early candle lighting" was the time usually fixed for
                    evening gatherings before watches were generally carried. At that witching hour, as they interpreted
                    it, the Methodist families from two or three miles away and occasional neighbors would gather to
                    hear a sermon. Sometimes Baptists would join in their devotions but not often, for denominational
                    lines were closely drawn. Those who were neither Methodists nor Baptists usually fiddled, danced,
                    and played cards, and were considered by the church people as reprobates.</p>
            <p>If he came at the end of the week and remained till Sunday, the circuit rider and any of the
                    congregation, up to fifty or so, would remain overnight. These would include old or crippled guests
                    to whom a walk of a mile or two or three and back would cause hardship. All the guests would sleep
                    as they could, the women in the house. Such men as could not find a place somewhere on the floor
                    inside the house would go to the barn or out under the trees. All would breakfast next morning on
                    such homely fare as the backwoods afforded. Any overflow crowd would be sent to <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-038-2-054"/> other cabins within a few miles from which they would return for
                    "morning class" by six or seven the next day. More than once a bishop of their
                    church honored the home of these pioneers by preaching in front of the great stone fireplace.</p>
            <p>The Sunday activities were not all inside the house, nor were all devotional in a religious sense. A
                    detached room that served as a summer kitchen, together with the wide outdoors often used as a
                    dining room, was also the scene of earnest devotion of a different kind. There the daughters and
                    their young friends, like Martha, were "cumbered with much serving," while their
                    elders "sat at the Master's feet and heard His word." For the religious
                    meetings were punctuated by calls to dinner long before the sun was at meridian, and to supper long
                    before darkness fell. Those girls and young matrons were expected to bake and boil and fry and serve
                    such quantities of food as would give a modern housewife heart failure just to think of it.</p>
            <p>Always the circuit rider, the bishop, if one were present, or the presiding elder, as the district
                    superintendent was then called, and the local preachers who, after riding the circuit for a few
                    years, had married and settled down to cultivate farms and rear families, and such old or infirm
                    persons or visitors from a distance as could not well come afoot, brought horses with them. These
                    were the charge of the young men and boys of the family and their companions, who preferred the open
                    air with light work to devotional exercises inside the house. One of these local preachers rode a
                    bay mare that when tied up would lean back on her bridle and break loose. Then she would roam about
                    looking for choice food or pasture, and cause the boys much trouble to catch her again. To insure
                    security, they finally put one end of a log chain around her neck and fastened the other to a young
                    elm tree that grew on the creek bank. The little mare pulled back and when nothing broke she pulled
                    harder until she threw herself down the creek bank and hung by the neck from the bending tree. The
                    boys had not meant to kill the preacher's mount and were much alarmed, but enough of them
                    soon gathered to lift the mare so that the chain was unhooked, after which she lay at the foot of
                    the bank both sadder and wiser than before.</p>
            <p>For years afterward, her owner boasted that while his riding mare had troubled him much by breaking
                    her bridle, <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-038-2-055"/> she never did so when he rode her to church
                    meetings at Brother Ewbank's home. Neither the boys nor the clock told of this adventure
                    until the local preachers, the circuit rider, and the parents had all passed to their long home, and
                    the grown-up boys had ceased to fear discipline, parental, or ecclesiastical. The elm tree lived and
                    thrived for nearly a century afterward, until its stump was five feet across and its branches
                    sheltered almost a fourth of an acre of ground. Then it was killed by minute insects working under
                    the bark. In the meantime, the creek had cut itself a new and deeper channel a hundred yards away,
                    and had filled its old channel and almost obliterated the high bank.</p>
            <p>The new home was at the edge of a former "deadening," an acre or two in extent.
                    Somebody, fifteen or twenty years before, to judge from the size of the second-growth saplings, had
                    killed the large trees and cut down or dug out enough of the undergrowth to make a small field. The
                    old trees had probably been burned down, as the few remaining stumps and snags were blackened and
                    charred. A patch in which to plant a little corn and a few vegetables between the seasons for
                    trapping furbearing animals might be prepared with less labor by fire than with axes and grubbing
                    hoes. It was then fifteen years since the wilderness along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River for a few miles west of the Great Miami had been surrendered by the Indians for
                    settlement by white men. Hunters and trappers had swarmed over it, intent on killing game and
                    selling furs, without either the means or the inclination to buy land from the government and open
                    farms. The Indians, and the hunters and traders who lived among them, had trapped and hunted over
                    those hills and valleys for many years. French traders had bought their furs, taking them down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River and its tributaries and then paddling back with their purchases.</p>
            <p>The newcomers had just finished constructing their log house, aided by all the other settlers within
                    a radius of several miles, when they heard most unearthly noises from the direction of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. Scarcely had they recovered from the alarm caused by these mysterious sounds
                    when they heard rumors of a great array of Indians under Tecumseh and the one-eyed Prophet, his
                    brother; of a military expedition against those Indians from the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country 150 miles away, commanded by their governor, William Henry <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-038-2-056"/> Harrison; of Indian depredations at Pigeon Roost and other places; and
                    of a battle near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> River where the Indians were defeated. Soon afterward an earthquake shook their house
                    so that the dishes rattled in the closets, and the tongs and shovels clattered on the hearth. Sad
                    news came up the river that the village of New Madrid in southeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> had been all but destroyed, and a tract of land eighteen miles long in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> had sunk and become the basin of what is now the Reelfoot Lake. This earthquake was
                    said to have been preceded by the same noises heard on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. The Ewbanks were relieved soon after to learn that these latter noises were made
                    by a steamboat, the first ever to descend the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River and then the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, up which it was not able to return. Having often heard and seen a steamboad on the
                    Hudson River at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, they were not frightened nor taken in by tales current among the settlers that the
                    monster which made such horrible noises had caused the earthquake. The Indian scare persisted into
                    the "War of Twelve," as it was called, and two or three of the sons from this
                    family saw service as Rangers or woodland militia, but without casualties.</p>
            <p>At first the newcomers had to depend chiefly on the forests for their living. There were no grocery
                    stores within many miles nor any money in circulation with which to buy groceries. A few bushels of
                    corn were purchased for seed and for an occasional taste of corn bread in one of the forms of
                    hoe-cake, Johnny-cake, or dodger. There were also acorns and nuts and many kinds of wild fruits, and
                    the roots of many plants were eaten as food, even in the fall and winter. Maple syrup, or tree
                    molasses as it was called, could be had for the labor of making it. The abundance of meat on a
                    pioneer's table depended only on his skill and diligence with gun and traps. There were
                    great flocks of wild turkeys and many other kinds of wild fowls. Deer roamed the woods in herds.
                    Bears were frequently seen. Squirrels and other small animals could be found by a sharp-eyed hunter
                    within a stone's throw of his home, if not in every tree. The streams were full of fish,
                    and neither seining, spearing, nor "gigging," was prohibited.</p>
            <p>Cutting second-growth trees of more than three inches across the stump, digging out the smaller
                    saplings and underbrush, and burning them in huge piles of brush and logs <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-038-2-057"/> to prepare a few acres for planting in the spring furnished occupation
                    through the fall and winter. Enough of the trees had to be split into rails and laid up as a
                    worm-fence to enclose the garden and grain plot, the panels zigzagging almost at right angles with
                    each other. These fences were built higher than a man's head, for there roamed in the woods
                    not only bears and flocks of turkeys and herds of deer that were all fond of corn, but also domestic
                    animals of every kind, horses, cattle, swine, and even sheep. It was not to be until seventy years
                    later that the law of Indiana would require owners to restrain by fences or tethers their domestic
                    animals on their own premises and to guard the crops of others from their depredations. Everybody
                    then adopted a "mark" for his hogs, cattle, and horses, either by branding each
                    animal with a hot iron, cutting its ears or tail in a peculiar manner, or providing other means of
                    identifying it. Then they turned all of them out to forage for a living on any unfenced land. The
                    thrifty farmer adopted definite times for giving his animals grain and salt, which taught them to
                    come often to his barn and not stray too far away. Cows readily learned to come home at milking
                    time. A large bell on a staid old cow served not only as a signal for the younger cattle to follow,
                    but gave notice where the herd could be found if they were too slow about coming in. An old mare
                    sometimes carried a bell in the same way to locate and bring home the colts and other horses. Many
                    animals practically ran wild until fully grown.</p>
            <p>A small reward for killing wolves had been offered before these settlers arrived, and only two weeks
                    after Indiana became a state this reward was doubled upon presentation of a petition by John Ewbank
                    and others, as the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of the state senate recites.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>The
                    bounty for killing wolves within six miles of "any of the settlements" was
                    increased to one dollar for each puppy under two months old, and two dollars each for all two months
                    old and upward. The scalp of each wolf with the ears entire had to be produced and affidavit made of
                    the hunter's belief as to the wolf's age. But the law is silent as to how the
                    exact age of a wolf puppy should be ascertained. Two dollars, the wolf bounty, was the price of an
                    acre of government land wherever situated from 1800 to 1820.</p>

                    substitutes for bread and syrup and vegetables, the settlers had a Herculean task to clear and fence
                    a few additional acres each year for planting corn, small grains, vegetables, and other crops. The
                    face of the country was entirely covered with giant forest trees with the undergrowth among them.
                    Before a field could be planted the large trees had to be cut down, or at least killed by cutting
                    through the bark all the way around them (girdling), so that the leaves would no longer shade the
                    ground; and the smaller saplings and bushes must be dug out by the roots. Then the brush had to be
                    collected in immense piles, which were later burned. Many logs from the trees that were cut down
                    were split up for fence rails or used in the building of house and barn or stable. The others were
                    cut and split into four-foot lengths to use in the house as fuel or they were rolled into huge heaps
                    and set on fire. Many trees that were only deadened were left standing while crops of Indian corn,
                    small grains, vegetables, and hay were planted and harvested among them for a few years, until the
                    limbs and trunks became dry enough that they were set on fire and burned down. A few acres were
                    added each year to the cultivated fields.</p>
            <p>After ten years John Ewbank, Sr., gave for a neighborhood cemetery and the site of a chapel the
                    half-acre of <figure>

                    the first few months. His church class, now grown to a congregation, built a stone meeting-house
                    which, with the cemetery surrounding it, much enlarged, is still in use.</p>
            <p>When our pioneer, after living twenty years in the log house, built and moved into the residence of
                    stone where his great-grandson now lives, only patches of cleared land had been opened in the
                    thousand acres of forest he had acquired. These clearings were dotted with stumps, especially <figure>
                  <p>
                            <hi rend="i">The Ewbank Home</hi>

               </figure> of the larger trees. The stone house had a brick oven built into the room designed for a
                    kitchen, in which a fire could be built and drawn out after its walls were thoroughly heated, thus
                    preparing the baking of a week's supply of bread and pies which could be done at one
                    operation.</p>
            <p>After another fifty years when the son John, who was my grandfather, passed away, the work of
                    "clearing" the fields still continued. After a hundred years, there still were
                    stumps to interfere with plowing and cultivation. Within less then ten years after they came, the
                    older sons and daughters had begun to marry, and were provided with separate <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-038-2-060"/> homes, barns, fences, and clearings. Soon the home on the bank of the
                    creek was grandfather's house and the tall clock was grandfather's clock, a
                    distinction they maintained for a full century.</p>
            <p>The small fields dotted with giant stumps that spread their roots just below the surface to trip up
                    unwary plowmen could not have been cultivated in the present fashion. Farm machinery as we use it
                    was then unknown, but modern implements could not have been operated over and among the stumps if
                    they had had them. Plows were of wood with possibly a cutting edge of metal which only scratched the
                    surface of the soft leaf mold. Corn was planted in holes dug with a hoe, and covered with dirt drawn
                    over it. Potatoes and like vegetables were planted in the same way. The principal tool for
                    cultivating all crops was a hoe. If there were not too many stumps, perhaps the corn might be
                    planted in rows and cultivated with a single-shovel plow drawn by one horse ridden by a boy or led
                    by a man. Small grains were sowed broadcast by hand and dirt was drawn over them by dragging a bush
                    (often a thorn bush) back and forth. The few stalks of corn produced were cut off and carried to the
                    barn where the ears were husked. When the wheat or oats or rye or barley was ripe, it was reaped
                    with long curved knives called sickles. A workman holding the sickle in his right hand would cut off
                    a handful of straws that he drew together and held in his left hand. Another man, or perhaps a
                    woman, would follow, collecting a small armful of these bunches of straw, which had been cut and
                    laid on the ground. They were bound into a sheaf with a band made of straws plucked from it. When
                    any such small grain had been harvested, it was threshed by spreading it upon a smooth floor of
                    boards, or perhaps of dry earth, and by beating the heads with what was called a flail. This
                    consisted of a stick much like a broom handle, with a shorter heavy club tied to the end of it. By
                    causing the club to swing at the end of the handle and strike the heads of grain, it could be made
                    to loosen the grain of wheat or rye or barley or oats from the chaff and straw. The straw was raked
                    away, well shaken to get the grain out of it, and the chaff and grain were placed in baskets and set
                    aside until they could be winnowed by the wind. When the wind blew hard enough and just right, the
                    chaff and grain were tossed up for it to separate by blowing <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-038-2-061"/>
                    the chaff away while the grain fell to the floor. Threshing and winnowing a bushel of wheat was
                    considered a fair day's work, though an occasional workman could thresh two bushels.</p>
            <p>Great-grandfather did not live to see the transition from the sickles to the cradle, which is a sort
                    of scythe equipped with fingers against which the straw would fall when cut by swinging the blade
                    against it. Reaping machines drawn by horses were invented after his death, and in the course of
                    many years were developed into self-binders that cut the grain and bound the sheaves with wire and
                    afterward with twine. Several of his grandsons had grown to be men before threshing separators were
                    invented, and two of them purchased and operated the first separator that was ever used on the
                    "Home Place" or near there. It only beat the grain and chaff loose from the straw,
                    to be winnowed by a fanning mill turned by a hand crank. These fanning mills were invented about the
                    same time as the separator, but the fans and screens were afterward built into the threshers.
                    Further developments of the past century have brought us to the "combine," which
                    reaps, threshes, and separates the grain at a single operation, while a tractor draws it across the
                    field.</p>
            <p>The clock has also watched the development of schools from the primitive ideal of pupils seated on a
                    log, facing the master seated on another, to our centralized system where children are carried in
                    auto busses six or eight or ten miles to schools where the eight grades are taught in different
                    rooms, and a four-year high school course is added. Such a school stands almost within sight from
                    the windows toward which the clock's face is turned. The pack-horse trail on which this
                    clock was brought up from the river, passing for miles along the rocky bed of the creek, developed
                    into a dirt road (often mud) along the top of the creek bank west of the stone house, afterwards
                    into a stone road on the sidehill east of it, and finally into a state highway paved with concrete
                    and asphalt.</p>
            <p>After forty years a railroad was built a mile away. After another fifty years a telephone was
                    installed in the room with the clock. It has witnessed and heard in succession the phonographs
                    operated with little wax cylinders, victrolas that had flat circular disk records, and radios that
                    automatically produce strange noises by day or night. It <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-038-2-062"/> has
                    seen in succession the children and youths who spent hours at a time playing with these new
                    inventions afterward bring children of their own to follow the same routine. It has seen a
                    succession of housewives arrive as blooming young brides, and half a century later carried away to
                    their long rest as aged grandmothers. It has listened to hopeful prophesies of optimism and to
                    dismal wails of pessimism.</p>
            <p>Through it all the clock has kept a straight face, attending strictly to its business of telling the
                    time, only thoughtfully observing tick-tock and punctuating the passage of each hour with strokes on
                    its bell.</p>

                    University as co-sponsors, was discontinued late in May. Glenn A. Black, the Society's
                    director of archaeology, will continue to reside and work at the site. He will have a force of three
                    or four men, all working for the Society. The Historical Bureau and the University will continue to
                    co-operate with the Society as before and during the operations of the W.P.A.</p>
            <p>It is only fair and in accordance with factual reporting to state here that this archaeological
                    project was an ideal setup for the purposes for which the W.P.A. was organized <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-038-2-064"/> and that it has been beyond question one of the best administered
                    projects in the history of the W.P.A. A large force of unskilled men, including many who would
                    otherwise have been dependent entirely upon relief, were employed upon the project. The number
                    varied in accordance with the resources of the project and the amount of unemployment in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>
                    </placeName> counties from more than one hundred to a dozen or so. Those who took advantage of this
                    employment to get pay without earning it were quickly eliminated, and the survivors without
                    exception became both interested and skillful in uncovering and. in handling prehistoric remains and
                    artifacts. There was no waste and remarkable little carelessness. The Society has every reason to be
                    gratified with the archaeological results and the Government is equally gratified at the economic
                    and social results of the labor employed.</p>
            <p>In response to a call for a committee of the Society upon early industries, little shops, and pioneer
                    methods of work, several members have already volunteered to serve on such a committee. At the
                    office of the secretary, 408 State Library and Historical Building, expressions of gratification
                    have been received that an opportunity might be provided for making known some of the places and
                    persons hitherto neglected by historical societies and writers. Longstanding committees on covered
                    timber bridges and on early water-power mills have done good works upon those subjects. With these
                    exceptions, the new proposed committee will cover the whole field of pioneer and contemporary
                    domestic industry. All members of the Society interested should enroll on the committee.</p>
            <p>Mass production for national and world distribution doubtless will be the chief method of production
                    from now on for an indefinite period, perhaps even after the natural resources upon which it feeds
                    begin to be exhausted. Accurate and intimate information about earlier, smaller, and simpler means
                    of production will become an increasingly interesting and important element in historical
                    records—and an element which will be increasingly difficult to supply. It may even be
                    that there is a place for little mills, little shops, and domestic production for home consumption
                    under the shadow of national and international mass production factory systems. If so, this
                    committee may be of help in the practical application of historical work.</p>

                    </placeName> during the peace negotiations following the American Revolution is of importance to all
                    interested in American history. As a factor in that determination, the expedition of George Rogers
                    Clark in 1778–1779 has long been a subject of argument among historians as well as among
                    an interested laity. That many people are convinced of its importance is attested by the magnificent
                    Memorial at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which commemorates Clark's conquest.</p>
            <p>Some historians, however, particularly among those whose associations have been on the eastern
                    seaboard, have been unwilling to admit the validity of claims as to the results of Clark's
                    invasion of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

                    following by the late Professor Edward Channing of <placeName>

            <p>The importance of the document to the history of the West and the fact that it has not hitherto been
                    published in translation are the chief justification for the publication of the memorandum in this
                    historical journal. It deserves to be more widely known than it has been, especially to students of

            <p>There are a number of imperfections in the publication by Professor Bemis, which serve to lessen the
                    confidence of the meticulous student, although otherwise they are not of a serious nature. They
                    appear to be the result of haste, perhaps in reading the document, which is difficult to decipher,
                    or in proof reading. Rayneval wrote on the right half of each page, leaving the left half for
                    amendments. On the right half of some of the pages various words, some of which can still be read,
                    were crossed out, and on the left hand side of some pages various changes and additions were made.
                    Bemis has not always indicated these changes to the reader. To be sure, they do not seem to be of
                    great importance, and it must be noted that the meaning of the document may be secured from the
                    Bemis text; but it is also true that the reader does not have before him the exact text of the
                    original document.</p>
            <p>Professor Bemis follows Channing in ascribing little importance to the Clark expedition as an
                    influence on the peace negotiations. He stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            enough to attribute to Clark any influence on the peace terms, far from supporting the
                            exaggerated claims that his "conquests" enabled the <placeName>

                    secretary could not be expected to be enthusiastic about the matter. He, however, definitely does
                    not exclude the possible presentation of the conquest as evidence supporting the claims of the
                    Americans.</p>
            <p>In the following pages there are presented, first, a reproduction of the photostat copy of the

                    translation of the document. In preparing the transcript the words that were scratched out on the
                    original but which are still legible are indicated by being inclosed in parentheses; if they are not
                    legible the parentheses indicate their place and the approximate space occupied by them. In the
                    translation, the words that were added in the left side of the page are indicated by being inclosed
                    in parentheses. There is one exception to this rule, both in the transcript and the translation. On
                    page eight the parentheses are in the original document, so the marginal note is placed in double
                    parentheses. The spelling, capitalization, and the accents of the original document have been
                    preserved in the transcript. Where the character of the accent was doubtful it was assumed to be in
                    accord with general practice. It was, also, impossible in many instances to distinguish between
                    capital and small letters.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the best means of reconstructing our knowledge of past times remains the examination of
                    official records of the period under consideration. In the case of the years before the wars for
                    control of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, Dr. Caldwell has used the reports and correspondence of French officers and
                    observers with real skill to show the problems facing the administrators of such an extensive
                    empire. Besides transcripts from the <hi rend="i">Archives Nationales, the Vaudreil Manuscripts</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="i">Public Record Office</hi>, he has searched through the <hi rend="i">Jesuit
                        Relations</hi> and other printed collections to find detailed and accurate data. Some of these
                    have been consulted for the first time on this subject. There is, however, some neglect of other
                    writers in the field. Despite Dr. Caldwell's assurances that he has consulted the other
                    printed sources he occasionally arouses the reader's desire to know what others have said
                    on the subject and whether the newly discovered evidence changes the previously accepted opinions.
                    An occasional sentence or footnote on the findings of others would have increased one's
                    confidence in his critical ability.</p>
            <p>In general, the author has set aside any preconceived notions about the inferiority of French
                    colonial administration and has shown by contemporary observation and report that the paternalistic
                    government of the French met with serious difficulties, difficulties which did not exist in the
                    English colonies. His sketch of the French colonial administration (Chapter I) is clearly drawn, but
                    is so brief as to be almost an abstraction; and his sharp conclusion (p.101) about the reasons for
                    the failure of the French system should be modified to a statement of fact about what did happen.
                    Generalizations based on the comparison (p. 44) between the English and French colonial
                    administration should include the observation that differences in national tradition, reasons for
                    migration, climate and geography, and even in the faulty carrying out. of a policy have been
                    overlooked. Most American writers, following Parkman, have been too eager to see the superiority of
                    democratic principles. Scholars, today, are not so sure of the democracy of all the English <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-038-2-107"/> colonies and it would be more proper to judge the failure of
                    the French on its merits and not on a hypothetical question of what the English would have done had
                    they landed at Quebec instead of Jamestown and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Dr. Caldwell has shown from manuscript sources the great difficulties that the French faced in their
                    colonial enterprise and in their attempt to build up and control the fur trade. He seems at times to
                    attach too much importance to the opinion of one observer, particularly Kalm (p.39) or Beauharnois
                    (p.67), but his authorities are contemporary and he has endeavored to use them impartially. He has
                    brought out quite well the relative importance of the various Indian wars which interfered with the
                    general plans and has indicated the beginning of the Anglo-French conflict in the valley. He gives
                    little significance to the superiority of English merchandise in quality and price and
                    underestimates the importance of the French missionaries. The statements of values in actual cash
                    figures is of slight use when the coin values were so changeable, but they do show careful work on
                    the part of the author. His conclusions are rather large for such a brief study. Dr.
                    Caldwell's mastery of the manuscript material is admirable and his style while not ornate,
                    is quite clear. Not to be picayune, but because of local interest, it should be pointed out that the

            <p>It is only recently that adequate historical studies of the Grand Army of the Republic have been
                    undertaken. It is a subject of significance for our own times, and Mr. Heck's contribution
                    is of outstanding importance and excellence. In his earlier pages he describes the purpose, ritual,
                    and nature of the Grand Army of the Republic, its slow start and early weakness in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, and its increased size and influence in the eighties and nineties. He then discusses
                    veteran activities in the state with considerable light on matters of national scope. Some of the
                    activities of the order <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-038-2-108"/> were social, being concerned with good
                    fellowship among comrades, convivial assemblage, fraternal benefaction, camp-fires, encampments,
                    flag ceremonies, parades, and excursions; others were of a public or political nature having to do
                    with pensions, soldier preference in government employment (often with slight duties), and pressure
                    politics in promotion of this or that type of soldier privilege.</p>
            <p>As to the party aspect of the G. A. R., one can point to that order's official declaration
                    prohibiting its use for partisan purposes. Practice and performance, however, did not always conform
                    to this well-intentioned rule. Many G. A. R. posts were "originally…organized as
                    Republican campaign clubs" and the order absorbed soldier groups united "primarily
                    for partisan purposes" (p. 238). In Indiana the Grand Army "served openly and
                    frankly as a political agency"; members were brought together "by their desire for good
                    fellowship and Republican supremacy" (p. 239). When the nonpartisan declaration was
                    adopted, many influential members resented this action; for this and other reasons local or state
                    officials looked with distaste upon the power and authority of "superior" national
                    officials. It was not uncommon for an ex-soldier seeking appointment to add party labors to his war
                    record, "exhibiting…a life-time of service for the Grand Old Party" (p.
                    162). Soldiers' and sailors' conventions, "ostensibly assembled to
                    consider…great…issues" were often of the sort that "any
                    well-informed Minnesotan…set…down as Radical Republican gatherings, pure and
                    simple" (pp. 191–192). The soldier vote was treated as a bloc. In circularizing
                    the veterans an astute politician would point to his "success at getting individual
                    pensions allowed or increased" (p. 187).</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most obvious functioning of the veterans as a pressure group was in connection with
                    pensions. When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> vetoed private pensions and exposed pension frauds he became the target of severe
                    veteran denunciation. Objecting to the principle that need be the criterion for pension eligibility,
                    the national encampment of the G.A.R. assumed a monopoly of the pressure function by adopting in
                    1884 "a gag rule forbidding posts to memorialize Congress regarding pensions, except
                    through the departmental and national headquarters" (p. 216). This was after more than a
                    thousand posts had petitioned in favor of the proposal that broken <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-038-2-109"/> and needy veterans should have preference over the strong and affluent.
                    By 1904 pensions had become universal for all who had war service; thereafter need or disability was
                    not necessary for eligibility.</p>
            <p>Numerous other topics are developed by Mr. Heck. He treats not only the G. A. R., but the
                    Woman's Relief Corps and various lesser veteran organizations, of which the Military Order
                    of the Loyal Legion was the most select, being a hereditary order whose high fees and emphasis upon
                    distinction kept it above the more plebian soldier groups. When treating intra-party factions the
                    author shows that no party in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> fitted the ideal of "a harmonious band of like-minded men" (p. 131).
                    He does not neglect contributions of the G. A. R. to community life, finding them more prominent in
                    sparse than in more settled areas. More might have been given on the relation of veterans to civil
                    service reform; perhaps more to patronage, though there are good bits on this theme. The word
                    "propaganda" does not appear in the index, for which many a reader will probably
                    be grateful; even so, it might be well if we had the G. A. R. counterpart to William
                    Gellermann's <hi rend="i">The American Legion as Educator</hi>. What matters chiefly,
                    however, is that the author, while mindful of reader interest, has served the cause of competent
                    scholarship. In elaborate annotations one finds credentials for every statement; those interested in
                    further study are assisted by an admirable bibliography and by other aids.</p>

                    which have qualified him to write authoritatively on Whiggism in the period 1760 to 1783. The
                    present essay, originating "from a particular interest in the lesser figures of that
                    Whiggism which was dominated by Burke," might perhaps more accurately be entitled <hi rend="i">A History of the Rockingham Whigs</hi>. For the other <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-038-2-110"/> Whig groups are treated inadequately. Possibly such Chath-amites as
                    Shelburne, Camden, Dunning, and Graf ton (but not Isaac Barre) receive their due. But too much is
                    left to the reader's imagination regarding the factions originally led by George Grenville
                    and the Duke of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It comes almost as a shock well toward the end to discover that "the death of
                    Suffolk and the resignation of Gower…left two groups leaderless within the ministry [p.
                    129]." Although the main theme is the relation of partisan divisions to imperial policy,
                    the author also seeks to show the relation between the imperial problem and domestic affairs. The
                    comprehensive documentation indicates how thoroughly Mr. Guttridge has delved into the pertinent
                    pamphlets, letters, and state papers. A few picayunish defects might possibly be noted, but the
                    preface takes care of most reasonable criticisms. It is to be hoped that the writer will eventually
                    emulate Mr. Feiling and provide us with that definitive history of the Whig party which has been so
                    long needed. No comment seems necessary on Professor Guttridge's style, as the rest of the
                    review is couched in his own words as much as possible.</p>
            <p>After being "submerged for forty years by the Whig tide" the Tories finally came up
                    on different sides of the ship. They found in George III a king who could manipulate Parliament in
                    the fashion of Walpole yet "kick away that aristocratic support which had preserved the
                    throne since the Revolution." Many associated themselves with a new party apparently
                    created unwittingly—a new Toryism, based on the "divine right of Crown in
                    Parliament." Some chose an independent role, while a few joined the Whigs, who had
                    gradually been transformed from the "reluctant revolutionaries of 1689" to
                    "complacent conservatives." In the late 1760's, the King was directing
                    his authoritarian policy particularly at John Wilkes and the American colonies. He was challenged at
                    home "by the champions of individual and corporate rights, organized in some degree as a
                    party."</p>
            <p>The Marquis of Rockingham had become the titular leader of the main body of the Whigs. Associated
                    with him in the House of Lords were such peers as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Devonshire, while William Dowdeswell, Sir George Savile, the erratic Charles Fox,
                    and David Hartley were prominent cohorts in the Commons. In addition to such staunch <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-038-2-111"/> party workers as Edmund Burke and George Byng, he relied on a few
                    merchants like William Baker and Richard Champion and a few lawyers and churchmen. These men,
                    generally speaking, had two aims, the attainment of which would satisfy both their own political
                    interests and Whig practice of limited monarchy—to secure responsibility of ministers to
                    Parliament and to maintain a coherent group acting as a unit either in opposition or as cabinet
                    members. Their American policy was largely one of expediency growing out of the domestic situation.
                    They had difficulty in accepting the American version of Locke, for while they "were the
                    champions of political liberty,…they preferred that liberty in its authorized English
                    translation." Eventually they were reduced to the awkward situation of hearing the
                    Americans talk like old Tories while George III attempted to uphold Parliamentary supremacy by
                    force. True to their Declaratory Act of 1766 they insisted upon the shadow of Parliamentary
                    supremacy until the latter part of 1775. Then Burke almost equalled Chatham in proposing concessions
                    to the Americans but was defeated in the Commons, 210 to 105.</p>
            <p>The alacrity with which the Rockinghams accepted the inevitability of independence after Saratoga
                    indicated that anything was preferable to "an imperial connection through the King
                    alone." Their oblique attacks on the Crown not only in the matter of the conduct of the war
                    but also of patronage, parliamentary reform, and other domestic problems rather justified
                    independents in regarding them as being largely factious. The North ministry, prolonged by the death
                    of Chatham in 1778 and the Gordon Riots in 1780, finally disintegrated from within, contrary to the
                    popular notion advanced by the old Whig historians (and even including G. M. Trevelyan). Rockingham
                    and Shelburne (the latter carrying on in the place of Chatham) headed a new ministry in 1782 made up
                    of factions whose incessant wrangling during their years of ineffectual opposition gave evidence
                    that the Whigs had gained little since the "sixties except experience." The French
                    Revolution finally forced them to give up their middle ground between the new Toryism and the
                    emerging radicalism. <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Burke (Rockingham having died) chose to go to the right; Fox pursued a more liberal
                    course.</p>

                    </placeName>'s new coöperative history fits very nicely into the gap between the
                    first and third volumes which have already appeared. It begins with the framing of the first <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> constitution with which the first volume closed. The author had written a thesis and
                    three or more articles in the field covered by this volume. The account of the political history
                    from 1803 to 1812, treated in the first two chapters, is not an inspired narrative, but smacks of a
                    twice told tale. One misses a reference to the biographical studies of Nathaniel Massie and of
                    Thomas Worthington in the footnotes of these chapters. A somewhat more dramatic account is given of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s part in the Burr conspiracy. A rather long chapter is devoted to the War of
                    1812 as it was related to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, but it can scarcely be said to make any significant new contribution to the subject.
                    The biographical references in respect to William H. Harrison are drawn from the work of Freeman
                    Cleves, not that by Dorothy B. Goebel. A peculiar error was made in citing Logan Esarey's
                        <hi rend="i">Harrison's Messages and Letters</hi> (p. 92). The absence of references to
                    the Duncan McArthur manuscripts is also puzzling at this point.</p>
            <p>In the fifth chapter, entitled "Acquiring a Farm," the author seems to have become
                    more enthusiastic, describing the origins of the settlers, the manner of acquiring their lands, and
                    the influence of speculation. The chapter on "The Farm in Production" indicates a
                    good understanding of the problems of the pioneer farmer and his resources and their gradual
                    improvement. A good account of the importance of waterways and of the life and business along them
                    is found in the seventh chapter, which also deals at length with the coming of the steamboat. The
                    next chapter describes the rise of certain settled districts in the state and the development of
                    roads of various kinds with various types of transportation services that connected these sections.
                    An excellent picture of the industries that developed almost on the frontier is found in the ninth
                    chapter. The importance of lumber, <pb n="215" id="VAA4025-038-2-113"/> potash, tan-bark, flour,
                    whiskey, wool, salt, iron, and pottery was explained and the substitutions of factories for
                    household industries described. The financial history of the state which was quite important is
                    related in chapter ten and its political, repercussions are described in the following chapter.</p>
            <p>Three very interesting chapters bring the volume to a close. They concern "Sickness and
                    Doctors," "The Struggle with Human Depravity," and "A Maturing
                    Society." The second of these is marked by a well-balanced understanding that is critical
                    but that avoids the extreme scepticism that marks many twentieth-century descriptions of religion on
                    the frontier. The final chapter contains a picture of a developing urban society against an
                    agricultural background in which frontier conditions were beginning to disappear.</p>
            <p>Excellent illustrations are liberally spaced throughout the work, an excellent index is found at the
                    close, and the general format of the book is as good as the illustrations and index. Like the other
                    volumes of the set it lacks a bibliography. Although it is not marked by the brilliance of the first

            <p>During the summer of 1939, while searching for some genealogical material in the Museum of the
                    Jackson County Historical Society, in the Jackson County State Forest, my attention was directed to
                    an interesting old record book. It is entitled <hi rend="i">Book No. 1, Record of Marks</hi> and is
                    the original record kept by the Recorder of Jackson County, Indiana, from 1817 to 1878 of the marks
                    used by the pioneers on the ears of their hogs.</p>
            <p>In early days there were few fences, and hogs roamed at will through the woods to fatten on beech
                    mast and acorns. It was therefore necessary to have some system of marking as proof of ownership. To
                    avoid duplication and to protect themselves in case a question arose concerning ownership, the
                    settlers registered their marks with the County Recorder. Even in Territorial days, hog raising was
                    important enough that laws were made providing punishment for theft of hogs, alteration of marks,
                    and failure to report strays.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Anna Borders, curator of the Jackson County Museum, graciously gave me permission to copy these
                    old entries to assist me in my search for some pioneer ancestors. Recently it occurred to me that
                    this list really serves as a rough directory of Jackson County in early days, and might be valuable
                    to many persons seeking proof of residence of their ancestors. I copied only the names and the dates
                    of recording with an occasional description to show the variety of styles in which hogs wore their
                    ears in those days. The pages of this old book are loose, and since they are not numbered there is
                    no way of telling if any are missing. Some entries seem to have been made in the spaces between
                    earlier entries—possibly to save paper.</p>
