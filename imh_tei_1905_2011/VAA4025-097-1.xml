            <p>In the spring of 1912, the Spector family of Kiev disembarked in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> following a harrowing escape from Russia. Over the previous eighteen months, in the
                    course of defending Mrs. Spector from the preposterous charge of ritual murder, Spector had lost his
                    successful food business. The victim of anti-Semitic state policy that exploited hateful medieval
                    fantasies about Jews, she had languished in prison for three months before her release. When Spector
                    learned that the authorities planned to reopen the case, he exhausted his resources in escaping with
                    his wife and three children to Galicia. They eventually made their way to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, where they arrived nearly penniless.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spectors' ordeal caught the attention of the Yiddish press, which referred the family to
                    the Industrial Removal Office (IRO).<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Founded in 1901 in <placeName>

                    </placeName> by German-American Jews, over the course of nearly two decades the IRO assisted
                    approximately eighty thousand Jewish immigrants to move from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
               </placeName>, and

                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to more than one thousand towns and cities throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Many thousands of eastern European Jewish newcomers to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>'s Lower East Side suffered because of chronic or seasonal joblessness. The IRO
                    argued that the labor market in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> could not absorb the annual influx of immigrants, especially those with few job skills.
                    Hence, the IRO subsidized the secondary migration of Jewish immigrants from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to more promising towns and cities in the American interior.</p>
            <p>In the Spector case, the IRO asked its contacts in the Jewish community of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> whether they would receive the family and help them get started. The first and most
                    important local task would be to secure a job for Spector so that he could provide unassisted
                    support for his family. The IRO's correspondents were sympathetic <list type="footnotes">

                    anxiety." Moreover, Goldstine promised that the family would "find some genuine
                    good friends, some of whom have themselves been transplanted from Kiev to Hoosierdom in almost the
                    same manner the Spectors are about to be settled."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> But some three
                    weeks after Goldstine's invitation, the IRO reported to him that the Spector family had
                    decided to remain in <placeName>

            <p>While most Jewish immigrants left Europe under less desperate circumstances than the Spectors, their
                    lives were not lacking in drama. For the many thousands who passed through Ellis Island between the
                    closing years of the nineteenth century and the beginning of World War I, the "golden
                    land" was more promise than reality, at least in their early experience. Newcomers had to
                    contend with squalor, crowded tenements, poor health, low wages or outright <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> was the terminus for some 70 percent of the Jewish immigrants disembarking at Ellis

            </p>
            <p>In the two decades between the onset of the eastern European immigration and the turn of the
                    twentieth century, Jewish philanthropic and charitable organizations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> feared that their resources would be overwhelmed by the sheer force of immigrant
                    numbers. Uncoordinated plans for immigrant dispersion in the 1880s and 1890s were adopted by several
                    Jewish organizations. Because the rising tide of Jewish immigrants constituted a challenge, in the
                    IRO view, to established Jewish communities, not only in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> but all across America, it was deemed appropriate to enlist the resources of Jews
                    throughout the country in dispersing the newcomers and alleviating pressures on organizations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. The IRO enlisted local committees, comprised of volunteers such as businessmen,
                    rabbis, social workers, and community leaders, to assist the newcomers in finding jobs and adjusting
                    to the new routines and expectations of American life.</p>
            <p>The desperate struggle to earn even a marginal living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> drove many immigrants to the application rooms of the IRO at Eleventh Street and Second
                    Avenue. Since the number of applicants far exceeded the capacity of the organization, only about one
                    quarter were resettled under IRO sponsorship. Prospective resettlers provided information that
                    enabled the IRO to relocate them to a place that offered them a good chance of employment. Skilled
                    laborers, for example, were sent where their skills were likely to be needed. Unskilled workers,
                    especially those over forty, were much more difficult to place. The IRO also took religious and
                    cultural considerations into account. An applicant who was particularly observant would not be sent
                    to a community that lacked kosher foods and a synagogue.</p>
            <p>Dispersion promised many benefits. First, it not only would reduce the burden on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> charities but it would also diminish immigrants' dependency by sending them
                    where jobs were available. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> labor market could not absorb all of the unskilled immigrants; moreover it could not
                    provide regular employment for those who were skilled, even in the needle trades, since those
                    workers were subject to seasonal layoffs. The IRO believed that dignified self-support was vital to
                    an immigrant's satisfactory adaptation to American life. In this respect, of course, the
                    IRO reflected American cultural values of self-sufficiency and individual responsibility.</p>

            <p>Second, solving the many social and economic problems associated with the new Jewish immigration
                    would help established German-American Jews to guarantee their own long-term security. The founders
                    of the IRO reiterated the concern often expressed by American Jews during the previous twenty years
                    that their economic and social standing might be imperiled by the new immigrants. By the turn of the
                    twentieth century, anti-immigration forces were gaining ground. Various segments of American
                    society—including northeastern patricians who had founded the Immigration Restriction
                    League in the 1890s, eugenics enthusiasts, populist politicians in the Midwest and South, and some
                    members of the labor movement—advocated severe limits on immigration through literacy
                    tests or other restrictions.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Even some Progressives, the liberals of the day,
                    criticized the increased diversification of ethnicity in the country in the wake of immigration.
                    They believed that a functioning democracy depended on cultural homogeneity.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    Opponents saw in the burgeoning immigrant enclaves of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and other large cities redoubts of regressive eastern European and southern European
                    patterns of life, as well as social pathologies that could only imperil the American nation. The
                    forces gathering against both immigrants and continued immigration could easily elide the
                    distinctions between Jews of German origin and the more numerous and vastly different new arrivals
                    from the so-called backward parts of Europe.</p>
            <p>Third, in meeting the challenges presented by the newcomers and thereby solving the problems critics
                    of immigration were attacking, the IRO would combat the movement for immigration restriction.
                    Dispersing Jewish immigrants, it was optimistically believed, would effectively neutralize
                    restrictionist arguments. Thus, German-American Jews were motivated by more than self-interest. On
                    the whole, they were plainly moved by the predicament of the Jews of eastern Europe, who were at
                    times subject to anti-Semitic violence and increasing limitations on their capacity to earn a
                    living. In opposing immigration restriction (and encouraging immigration), American Jews of German
                    background were favoring policies that would further exacerbate the very problems of big city life
                    that they were trying to combat through dispersion programs.</p>
            <p>Fourth, the IRO believed that resettling immigrants would promote their cultural accommodation to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    enclaves of the metropolis. The IRO's credo was unabashedly assimilationist, and while this
                    did not mandate a complete cultural absorption of the immigrants, it offered as a model of proper
                    accommodation the pattern of living established by German Jews in America over the previous
                    generation.</p>
            <p>Most German Jews had arrived in the 1840s and 1850s. They brought with them conceptions and practices
                    that contrasted markedly with those of later Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. Many German Jews
                    supported the Reform movement, which sought to reconcile Judaism with modernity and science by
                    emphasizing the most rational, universal features of the faith. Thus, Reform Jews shed many ancient
                    beliefs and practices in order to erode ethnic and cultural differences between themselves and their
                    Christian neighbors. The German Jewish adaptation to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, accordingly, conformed to the national value placed on assimilation. Because the
                    practices of eastern European Jews raised doubts about their ability to become like other Americans,
                    Jews of German background devoted considerable energy to hastening their coreligionists'
                    adaptation to the majority culture.</p>
            <p>The nearly eighty thousand immigrants resettled between 1901 and 1917 under IRO auspices constitute,
                    of course, a very small fraction of the total eastern European Jewish immigration; some 2.5 million
                    arrived between 1881 and 1924.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Therefore, the IRO's effort to thin out
                    the Lower East Side seems at best modest. Yet the IRO plan aimed to take advantage of characteristic
                    features of Jewish immigration that created a multiplier effect. Specifically, a town or city would
                    attract more Jews if their kinsmen and friends had already taken up residence there. Often, for
                    example, a young husband and father would make the expensive voyage to America by himself. He would
                    eventually send for his wife and children after earning enough money for their passage. Other kin,
                    including parents, siblings, and in-laws, and sometimes old-country friends might then follow. The
                    IRO was convinced that each immigrant who left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

                    </placeName> or from Europe. Although IRO records chart only the resettlement of clients, their new
                    locations in all likelihood affected subsequent decisions by other immigrants who acted
                    independently of the IRO. Hence, the efficacy of the dispersion program was probably much greater
                    than the official numbers indicate. For example, the IRO estimated that sixty people settled in <placeName>

                    in forty-eight towns and cities throughout the state. Only eight states received more people. <placeName>

                    arrived there through IRO assistance; but it is fair to say that Terre Haute was a major IRO

            <p>The IRO regularly solicited reports from chambers of commerce and other civic organizations about the
                    changing economic and social climate of their towns in order to determine their suitability. The IRO
                    also sent traveling agents to visit prospective sites, both to organize new committees and to
                    collect information. And, when previously cooperating committees seemed to back away from
                    resettlement work, IRO agents were sent to revitalize the connection.</p>
            <p>Since IRO agents consistently remarked upon the favorable conditions in Indiana towns and cities, the
                    organization was sanguine about the potential for successfully resettling immigrants in the state. <placeName>

                    begin working. In this event, the immigrant's support had to be provided from the coffers
                    of the local people. If dependency proved to be at all prolonged, the relationship between immigrant
                    and hosts could sour. A few such cases rankled the local IRO committee and diminished their
                    enthusiasm for resettlement work. Whether they criticized the main office for a faulty screening
                    process or complained that more newcomers had been sent than could be absorbed, committees were
                    never reluctant to take a self-protective position. If the new arrival was arrogant or rude, the
                    cooperative spirit was further damaged. Sometimes immigrants suddenly left a town with unpaid debts,
                    and that, too, severely tested local commitment to the IRO program.</p>

                    Jews, who constituted the majority of the IRO committee, belonged to the Reform temple. The

                    Abraham, the orthodox synagogue, indicates a level of cooperation between German and Russian Jews

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The IRO maintained an unsentimental attitude toward its clients and urged its cooperating committees
                    to undertake resettlement in the same spirit. The IRO did not promise immigrants more than the best
                    efforts of a community to help find them a job at a living wage. If clients refused work or were
                    uncooperative, the IRO felt no further obligation and urged its cooperators to cut off support for
                    rent and food for such persons. Above all, the IRO insisted that its allies were not to provide a
                    return ticket to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. But local committees found that abjuring former obligations was not quite so easy.
                    Local Jews were greatly discomfited by the presence of unhappy, complaining immigrants in their
                    midst. They were tempted to eliminate the problem by capitulating to a client's demand for
                    rail fare to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> or elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Chastened by early difficulties, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> committee nonetheless agreed to continue to cooperate with the IRO. Along with their
                    counterparts in other towns and cities, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> group also had to confront the irksome problem of unsponsored Jewish immigrants seeking
                    handouts after drifting into the city. The growing pains of the young IRO movement and conflicting
                    views about drifters within interior communities were quite apparent at this early stage. The
                    tendency of local committees to subsidize Jewish transients and help them travel was a particularly
                    sore point among Jewish philanthropies. In the short term providing transportation relieved a town
                    from the burden of jobless and disaffected newcomers. While the IRO committee in that town could
                    thus reduce its welfare fund expenditures, the basic problem of shiftless itinerants seeking
                    handouts was not solved: it was simply exported.</p>
            <p>In December 1903 Solomon Gillis and Louis Gordon arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the IRO had arranged for their resettlement. Unable to find work there, they

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Leipziger described Gillis as unable to speak English and "broken in
                    spirit." After the main office failed to respond to a cable for advice, Leipziger sent
                    Gillis back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                    </placeName>, Leipziger asked him to stay. He argued that keeping Gillis in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, by contrast, would have had serious consequences for the local IRO work, since a
                    failed placement would discourage local cooperation. Leipziger wanted only "the pick of the

                    local committee's wariness. In this respect they were like other IRO local groups, alert to
                    the financial costs and personal inconvenience they might have to incur. As to Leipziger's
                    request that Terre Haute receive only the "pick of the crowd," Bressler replied
                    that a good start in the city required that the IRO send "as pioneers good reliable
                    workers." But, he added, that was the IRO goal in every case.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the problem of drifters, Leipziger argued that the committee that received IRO clients
                    should maintain an interest in them, even after they left town; hence the IROs cooperators ought to
                    be grateful to other committees for returning "their" clients to them, since
                    otherwise, if such men were permitted to drift, they would bring disrepute on the entire removal
                    movement. Recalling the initial responses of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Jews to immigrant distribution, Leipziger explained that five immigrants
                    were welcomed. But in less than ten days, four of them were dissatisfied with their jobs and were
                    about to leave town. The committee paid for the return of the men to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, which Leipziger saw as a responsible action, just as he felt that returning Gillis to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the proper course. Leipziger assumed, mistakenly, that the "IRO would
                    rather have ten incompetent men thrown back on them, than have one drifting about the states,
                    casting disrepute upon the movements [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] and its successes."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bressler was unequivocal about the IRO's disapproval of transportation subsidies. When
                    immigrants refused work, he argued, supporting their travel to another town defeated the plan of
                    immigrant dispersion. Once a community was satisfied that it had rendered all the help anyone might
                    justifiably expect, then those who continued to make unreasonable demands "must be left
                    severely to themselves and a single penny spent on them, either in material relief, transportation
                    or otherwise is shear [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] waste."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While one of their major goals was to arrange livelihoods for newcomers, the IRO recognized that the
                    matching of communities and clients would never be perfect. Moreover, committees had to expect that
                    sometimes there would be a time lag between the immigrant's arrival and his placement in a
                    job. While the IRO's cooperators repeatedly appealed to the main office to scale back
                    resettlement activity in the wake of failed placements or of men not yet placed, Bressler and his
                    colleagues did so only reluctantly. The IRO consistently implored committees to maintain or increase
                    the number of resettlers they agreed to accept.</p>
            <p>In response to Bressler's criticism of their subsidizing clients' transportation

            <p>Bressler described a family consisting of parents and three children who had fled Odessa following a

                    provided they are sent conservatively." Unfortunately, the IRO had no mandate to establish
                    people in business. Bressler, however, did inform Schloss that an organization that wished to remain
                    anonymous had pledged money to support new immigrant businesses. It was willing to commit

                    Stanley Bero arrived in the city in November 1907 to rejuvenate resettlement activity. Describing
                    the town as "booming," Bero observed that the Jews had been sleeping, but he found
                    the orthodox congregation enthusiastic. As for the Reform Jews, Bero found them lukewarm to his
                    proposals. Bero argued that the level of cooperation and the number of people resettled would
                    probably have been greater if the group from eastern Europe had been in charge, since they were more
                    energetic and supportive than the Reform Jews.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    to accept a given number of families or individuals each month. They resisted, opting instead to

                    </quote> Leipziger's concerns were, of course, a reprise of the apprehensions expressed to
                    Bressler four years before, which eventually led to an interruption of IRO activity in <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Bressler regularly assured all his correspondents that great care was taken in every case. It would
                    not do to present the organization as rendering anything less than the closest scrutiny of each
                    applicant. Failed placements were presented as the exception, and while IRO officials certainly
                    acknowledged that they sometimes erred, they depicted themselves as carefully deliberating about
                    every case and always considering the compatibility between the immigrants and the receiving
                    community.</p>
            <p>Internal IRO correspondence offers a somewhat different picture. Bero, for example, took a special
                    interest in the selection process. In November and December 1907 he persuaded the Jewish communities
                    of twenty-four towns in <placeName>

                    </placeName> is now definitely committed to co-operate in the highly important work of distributing
                    Jewish immigrants." While accepting Leipziger's terms for receiving single IRO
                    clients or families, Bressler also hoped for a heightened level of activity, including the
                    acceptance of a specific number of people each month.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> But once again,

                    chairman. In assessing the town, Margolis noted that the Jewish population of approximately five
                    hundred was divided about evenly between Russians and Germans, each group with its own synagogue but
                    joined together in a single B'nai B'rith Lodge. Margolis reported more approvingly
                    than his predecessor the attitudes of the Reform Jews on the removal work; Margolis described them
                    as "a very good class of people… willing to do whatever they can to promote the
                    welfare of those whom we remove." Nevertheless, he felt that they were overly committed to
                    the principles of scientific charity. This, of course, was somewhat ironic in view of the
                    IRO's efforts to transform older forms of personal almsgiving into a rationalized system of
                    social welfare based on disinterested investigation. Margolis may have been responding to
                    particularly severe attitudes held by some committee members. He thus urged them to "temper
                    their scientific charity with a little sentiment" and exhorted them to realize their
                    obligation to do their share in mitigating the problems faced by Jewish immigrants in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Margolis also undertook an aggressive strategy by visiting businesses and industrial concerns to
                    canvass job opportunities in the city and to publicize the IRO. While these activities were normally
                    left to local committees, the overall decline in IRO placements after the depression of 1907
                    prompted more determined tactics by traveling agents. Margolis was confident about IRO prospects in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> after meeting representatives of local businesses and securing some requisitions for
                    IRO clients directly from business managers, both Jewish and non-Jewish. One businessman, for
                    example, expressed great interest in hiring a skilled paper hanger from the IRO in the belief that
                    Jewish workers were more reliable than others and not given to drink.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In contrast to the results of his inquiries in other businesses, Margolis's canvass in the
                    wake of the 1907 economic decline turned up no prospects of positions in industrial concerns.
                    Instead of adding employees, many industries were discharging people. Still, he remained confident,
                    both because of his belief in the city's expansive future and the interest expressed by the
                    managers he consulted. In <placeName>

                    </placeName>, described by Margolis as "growing and up to date," the cost of
                    living was moderate, with house rentals available from $12 to $15 per month
                    and wages for skilled workers reaching $20 to $25 per week. Margolis visited
                    the secretary of the Commercial Club, who closely monitored the industrial situation, including the
                    labor requirements of various factories. He said he was willing to keep the IRO apprised of
                    opportunities and to use his influence to secure positions for IRO <list type="footnotes">

                    surmised that Terre Haute could become one of the most important destinations for IRO-sponsored
                    Jewish immigrants. He reported that employers were disappointed at the reliability of available
                    workers but recognized the "higher intelligence of the Russian Jew as workingman."

            <p>In December 1908 Margolis tried again to stimulate IRO activity in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The committee invited the IRO to send one man the following month, after which
                    Leipziger would inform the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> office about how many additional people to send. Leipziger also agreed to survey all
                    local factories in order to establish a relationship that would result in placements of IRO men.
                    Margolis's understanding was that the committee would accept eight men and one family per
                    month by the spring of 1909.</p>
            <p>Schloss, a clothier, asked Margolis to send him two highly skilled coat makers, so that he could
                    provide more expensive lines of clothing for the wealthy citizenry of the city. But if the IRO could
                    provide tailors acquainted only with production for the trade houses, he was not interested and
                    advised Margolis not to send them.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Schloss's specifications were precisely the kind of restrictions that Bressler repeatedly
                    discouraged his correspondents from imposing, and they represented another source of strain between
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> office and its many cooperators. Bressler insisted at various times that the IRO was
                    not an employment agency engaged simply in meeting the specific labor needs of employers. Instead,
                    Bressler wanted jobs found for particular individuals and argued that communities must be willing to
                    accept a certain number of men for whom jobs had not yet been found, which required some
                        sacrifice.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Despite their support of the IRO program, committees did not
                    quietly endure a steady stream of newcomers without imminent employment prospects. Schloss was
                    willing to concede little or nothing to the IRO entreaty. He knew what sort of men he could put to
                    work immediately, and employment on arrival or shortly thereafter became the <hi rend="i">sine qua
                        non</hi> of cooperation. Schloss's outlook was shared by most members of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> committee during its years of operation, and indeed this point of view was not at all
                    unusual among IRO cooperating committees and agencies.</p>
            <p>In October 1912 another IRO traveling agent, Abraham Solomon, visited the city to reassess industrial
                    conditions and gauge the possibility once again of elevating the IRO committee to agency status.

            <p>Leipziger wrote to Bressler to confirm the enthusiasm that Solomon's visit had rekindled
                    among committee members. Placing great confidence in Solomon's survey of <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s industry and commerce, the committee agreed to increase the number of IRO
                    clients it would accept.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> But by December, when Leipziger submitted a report
                    describing eight men who had been sent to the city, his tone was decidedly less optimistic. An
                    immigrant named Marcus had come to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a presser but did not make good on two jobs, including one in nearby Linton.

                    </placeName>, he worked briefly in a glass factory and a rolling mill but quit after complaining
                    constantly. He then began working as a repairman for the streetcar line. The committee helped to
                    move him into a house that rented for $15 per month, where he could realize some extra
                    income by taking in roomers and boarders. But he still cost the committee over $100. This
                    sum included money paid to him as rent for two other IRO men, who left town after a few days without
                    paying Marcus. Another client, a tailor, also left town quickly. Of the eight men, only Rubin (with
                    his family), Smith, a laborer, and Lubetsky, a presser, were engaged in steady work.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Smith worked in a foundry and was given a chance to learn some skilled work, but he quit because of
                    the influence of another IRO client, Nathan Grossmann, whom Leipziger described as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Nathan Grossmann, whom you called in your record a "born tailor" is among
                            other things a born trouble maker. He went to work for a Mr. Silvers—Ladies
                            Tailor and at once began to own the place. Mr. Silvers gave him $6.00 for the
                            first two day's [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] work and Grossmann kicked. In <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                            </placeName> he made his $30.00 to $35.00 a week, he said. He
                            continued to work, making himself more and more obnoxious to Silvers. At the end of another
                            week Silvers wanted to give him $18.00 and he kicked strenuously for
                            $20.00. Silvers gave it to him but also gave him his walking papers. Grossmann
                            has the notion that it is a virtue to deceive and exploit the Removal Committee. He refuses
                            even to show the shadow of willingness to pay his own way. He was given a job with a Mr.
                            Mitchell, a custom tailor who found him inefficient. Mr. Mitchell told me he
                            wouldn't dare to send out work such as Grossmann turned out. He had to let him go.
                            So Grossmann who drew $26.00 in 8 days has not paid a cent of his own way and
                            answers all requests that he show even his willingness saying that he is sending all his
                            money to his family. I wonder if he is! Besides Grossmann is spending his time making Marcus
                            and Smith and others dissatisfied.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Bressler was surprised at Grossmann's actions in view of evidence that the IRO in <placeName>

                    </placeName> had gathered directly from him. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Contrary to his statement that he was making $30 to $35 a week, he was
                            earning from $16 to $17 a week, "not steady." This,
                            according to facts given by himself. He had been idle two months when he applied to us,
                            which was on November 15th, and as we only sent him on December 4th, virtually another three

                            another cent would I expend upon him, because there is not reason for it. He can work if he
                            wants to, for from what you say employment is available. As to whether or not he sent all
                            his money to his family, I do not know, but I shall make it my business to find out.</p>
                    </quote> Nevertheless, Bressler found more reason for optimism than gloom, partly to keep up the
                    flagging spirits of his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> colleagues. He noted that six of the eight clients remained in the city, four were
                    working satisfactorily, and a fifth, Smith, had been suitable until coming under the influence of
                    Grossmann. Bressler praised the committee's record, which he felt should give them ample
                    reason for encouragement. As to Grossmann's dissatisfactions and his negative influence on
                    local IRO work, Bressler admitted that there would always be a few clients who were unhappy and
                    churlish, although "firm handling" would reclaim some of them.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>Bressler pointed out that even the most successful businessmen sometimes faced material setbacks
                    because of poor judgment or misplaced confidence. The IRO's "occasional lapse from
                    infallibility" and its lack of "specialists in human souls," if seen in
                    this light, were worthy of forbearance. Bressler lauded the <placeName>

                            contribution, and even then we believe it advisable [to] send the family, as there is no one

                    </quote> The IRO's intransigence was sharply criticized by Kaplan and Goldstine. They saw
                    the IRO decision as heartless. Regarding the Gordon case and that of another man they sought
                    unsuccessfully to bring to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Goldstine informed the main office that Kaplan "is utterly disgusted
                    … and does not care to write any further about them and does not care to have any further
                    dealings with your office." Goldstine chided the IRO for poor investigations in the past
                    and criticized Bressler's refusal to send immigrants for whom the community would assume
                    complete responsibility.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>Bressler, rather than the acerbic Solomon, responded to the disgruntled committee members. Although
                    distressed by the controversy, he nonetheless supported Solomon's assessment and offered
                    further defense of the main office's refusal to provide help. Bressler politely asserted

            <p>Sometimes a committee might advise the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> office against supporting an application because local relatives, although financially
                    able, were unwilling to assist the applicant. Not wanting the applicant to suffer as a result of the
                    selfishness of his relatives, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> office, if it found the individual unable to help himself, often pressed the local
                    committee to alter its decision in favor of permitting the applicant to settle in the town. This, of
                    course, would add to the burden of the committee. Bressler also indicated, apropos of the Gordon
                    case, that sometimes the situation was reversed and a client could contribute to his own
                        transportation.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the basis of Solomon's investigation, Bressler believed that Gordon was not in need of
                    support. With his wife and child, he lived in an $18 flat, "hardly an indication
                    of that destitution and poverty which Dr. Kaplan was informed of by emotional friends of
                    Gordon's in your city." Consequently, the main office sought a contribution from
                    Gordon toward transportation costs. In the past it might have been possible to waive the
                    contribution and give the applicant the benefit of any doubt. But a 50 percent cut in the IRO
                    operating budget for 1914 had forced them to conserve limited resources for the many applicants
                    without personal assets. Still, because Gordon had no relatives in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he was entitled to some assistance. Leaving the final word to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> committee, Bressler indicated that if Goldstine and Kaplan continued to believe that
                    the IRO had acted badly, the main office would pay the entire cost of transportation.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though he was convinced that Gordon did not require assistance, Bressler put pragmatic interest above
                    his own better judgment. Consistently conciliatory, Bressler recognized the necessity of maintaining
                    a cordial and trusting association if the work was to proceed. He informed Kaplan that Gordon would
                    leave for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at IRO expense, the following day. Characteristically, Bressler also tried to mend the
                    IRO's relationship with members of the committee, particularly Kaplan and Goldstine. He
                    said that such disagreements were inevitable and provided an opportunity to clarify IRO principles
                    and practices.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kaplan and Goldstine had confidence in the propriety of their view, but most committee members were
                    driven by business principles. Schloss, for example, seemed unwilling either to give the immigrants
                    any quarter or to risk inconvenience. Kaplan and Goldstine, by contrast, were strongly committed to
                    IRO work and made per- <list type="footnotes">

                    sometimes was not repaid or by boarding the newcomers. They disagreed with Schloss and some other
                    members of the committee who, by 1914, were even more resistant than before to providing aid to
                    newcomers who were unable to find work immediately after their arrival.</p>
            <p>Kaplan and Goldstine remained flexible, yet their sympathetic actions were clearly restrained by
                    their colleagues and by lack of funds. Kaplan proceeded without the knowledge of his cautious
                    associates to resettle Gordon. He believed Gordon's connections to the community provided
                    defensible grounds for his actions. Because Gordon had a friend in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Kaplan and Goldstine could see their way clear to receiving him with the help of the
                    main office. They expected that persons who were bound to newcomers by ties of kinship or friendship
                    would also provide assistance, however meager it might be. But Kaplan recognized that the community
                    might ultimately bear some financial responsibility if work did not materialize and relatives or
                    friends reached the limit of their ability to help. He was also constrained by the
                    committee's opposition to "direct" cases—individuals or
                    families without local ties. Thus limited, Kaplan believed that he could act only in
                    "request" cases—those in which people already settled sought IRO help
                    in bringing kin or friends—exemplified by Gordon. Consequently, Kaplan and Goldstine felt
                    particularly exasperated when the IRO resisted their plea for financial help in bringing Gordon to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Kaplan concluded that "the only cases I can help without making a stir
                    … you refuse to help so there is nothing for me to do but to let the work
                        alone."<hi rend="sup">58</hi> As the dispute with the <placeName>

                    that the "work here is done by Mr. Goldstine and myself not in connection with the
                    committee but in opposition to the committee."<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After several months, Gordon's attempt to find a position had come to naught, despite the
                    vigorous efforts of some members of the community to assist his job quest. In Kaplan's
                    view, this was a special difficulty of small cities. Goldstine and Kaplan decided that it would be
                    desirable for Mrs. Gordon, who was a dressmaker, and their child to join Gordon. Once reunited, they
                    reasoned, the Gordons would stand a better chance of achieving self-support. Accordingly, Kaplan
                    wrote to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>

            <p>Once again the blunt Solomon responded initially, denying the request because Mrs. Gordon was
                    reportedly earning some money in dressmaking. Further, she lived with relatives and paid no rent. He
                    argued that since Gordon had resided in <placeName>

                    responded in kind to Solomon's brusqueness, while appealing for the addition of "a
                    little bit of Jewish spirit in the dry bones of this case." He informed Solomon that Mrs.
                    Gordon had no money. Gordon, a man of "excellent character," had remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> for "six months without his having made one cent and at a cost to Mr.
                    Goldstine, who is by no means a rich man, except in good deeds at a cost of
                    $150." Kaplan had also advanced Gordon $25, thereby exhausting the
                    available allotment for immigration work, and felt personally responsible for making good on the
                        loan.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goldstine also provided more details about Gordon's situation in the hope that Bressler
                    would "stretch a point and carry out our wishes in full justice to the case."
                    Gordon boarded with Goldstine, who also had advanced him money for a business venture that failed.
                    He used the money to purchase an inventory of goods to sell, but the business downturn of the time
                    left him with the unsold merchandise and no money. Goldstine then implored Bressler to act favorably
                    on the request, in terms more in keeping with the older, more personal forms of charity that the IRO
                    was eager to supplant: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The case is truly a pitiful one. He is here without a penny to his name, naturally

                            see a man of his intelligence, uprightness and gentlemanliness should be reduced to such a
                            miserable condition. There is only one ray of hope for the improvement of his immediate
                            future and that is to get his wife here and we will all try to supply her with work in

                    experiment in ethnic patronage. The organization remained convinced that pressures for immigration
                    restriction would abate if immigrants and their supporters could solve the social and economic
                    problems associated with dense ethnic settlements. At the same time, those problems were growing
                    more acute with the continuing arrival of many thousands of newcomers each year. Thus seeing its
                    mission as urgent, the IRO continually appealed to its correspondents throughout the country for
                    greater sacrifices on behalf of the larger good.</p>

                    impoverished and sometimes desperate immigrants were often in conflict with the immediate material
                    interests of the community. IRO clients who quickly became self-supporting members of the community
                    reinforced a local mood of altruism and a willingness to advance the IRO's ambitious
                    program, while idle or recalcitrant newcomers who taxed either a community's charitable
                    resources or its patience could stifle its unselfish inclinations. David Bressler and his IRO

            </byline>
            <p>Kenneth Gearhart Baker (1896-1988), born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, was a veteran of the
                    two world wars of the century that has just ended, and in his last years, in the 1980s, he
                    remembered the earlier one better than he did the later. By then removed to a retirement apartment
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, he began in 1984 to write his memories of the war of 1917-1918 and of the occupation
                    of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in the early months of 1919. He wrote with a pencil on a yellow paper tablet, while
                    sitting (so his daughter, Betty Baker Rinker, remembers) in the easy chair of his living room. By
                    the time he finished he had completed virtually a small book. He died in 1988, and his daughter
                    arranged in 1993 for his manuscript to be typed. She deposited a copy in the archives of the U.S.
                    Army Military History Institute, a part of the Army War College in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and it was there that the present editor found it.</p>
            <p>The author of "Oatmeal and Coffee" was the second son of Hoosier farmer Charles
                    Baker and his wife, Mary. After the family, including a younger sister, moved in 1901 to a farm
                    southwest of Wolcott, Kenneth Baker attended country schools in White County until 1912, when the
                    family moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county seat, where Kenneth graduated from high school around 1915.</p>
            <p>When the <placeName>

                    </placeName> entered World War I, Baker and his friend Henry Brucker were enrolled in a technical
                    training course for electricians at the Milwaukee College of Engineering. On May 8, 1917, they
                    enlisted in the 1st <placeName>

                    service, except for five months in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                    "casual," i.e., a soldier not regularly attached to a unit.</p>
            <p>After the war Baker returned to Indiana. He entered Purdue University in the autumn of 1919 and
                    graduated with a degree in electrical engineering. He married his Purdue sweetheart, Bertha Walton,

                    supply officer and an executive officer.</p>
            <p>There is of course something nostalgic about reading Baker's account today, in a new century
                    with World War I far in the past, beyond memory of most Indiana residents, and with only a small
                    remnant of its veterans still alive—at last count the state's surviving vets
                    numbered sixteen out of the tens of thousands of Hoosiers who took part in that war and who for so
                    many years were leaders in the state, and, some of them, the nation. The entire generation that
                    included Kenneth Baker and his contemporaries, those born in the 1890s, is nearly gone. American
                    Legion parades of yesteryear, so familiar to later generations, are now far in the past. The toy
                    trains with cars marked "40 &amp; 8," representing the freight cars in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in which forty soldiers or eight horses were transported to the front, which appeared
                    in the parades on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Armistice Day, are no longer to be seen.
                    Indeed Armistice Day, a staple celebration of some of us Hoosiers older than average, has now been
                    translated into Veterans Day. If someone asked the average Indianan what day is or was the real
                    Armistice Day, he or she would respond, probably, with surprise and almost surely without being able
                    to relate the long-ago and for a while so-well-remembered date of what seemed established for
                    eternity as the most important event in national and world history—the armistice declared
                    in the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918.</p>
            <p>World War I, begun in Europe in 1914, changed the history of Europe, America, and for that matter all
                    nations and peoples of the world. In 1917 Americans hastily approved going to war. They had been
                    shocked by the way in which imperial <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> had not merely plunged Europe into war two and one-half years earlier but had behaved
                    so wantonly in sinking the great liner <hi rend="i">Lusitania</hi> in 1915 and then almost two years
                    later defying the government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by resuming the unrestricted use of submarines, an act that brought the American
                    declaration of war.</p>
            <p>All this was a prelude to the enlistment in the U.S. Army or acceptance of the draft by Kenneth Baker
                    and so many other Americans, in hope of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s defeat and the survival, as they put it, of civilization itself.</p>
            <p>How does Baker's memoir fit into the literature of American participation in World War I?
                    Libraries now contain shelf upon shelf of accounts, and how important is his?</p>
            <p>Its sources are difficult to detail. It is unclear how Baker managed to hold his experiences in
                    1917-1919 in his mind for nearly seventy <pb n="29" id="VAA4025-097-1-035"/> years. Like so many
                    soldiers of his time he kept a diary, which was contrary to regulations. Unfortunately, his daughter
                    reports, after he brought it home his horrified mother read it and destroyed it. But it is clear
                    that, even without his diary, he did remember what, after all, may well have been the most
                    impressive experience of his life. Until he reached nearly the end of his narrative he kept the
                    chronology straight. (At the close he was apparently losing the ability to concentrate; he died not
                    long after finishing it.) In seeking to end the account he also, one suspects, departed from
                    chronology in order to include all sorts of miscellaneous experiences. His memory was no doubt aided
                    by his copy of his division's history, published in 1920.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> A post-World
                    War II trip to <placeName>

            <p>In one way Baker was not typical of American soldiers during World War I; while many of them found it
                    intensely difficult to record their experiences, this soldier from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName> somehow had learned to write in a straightforward way. He managed, with ease, to
                    achieve a tight literary style. And he could introduce humor, in contrast to so many of the accounts
                    of World War I that were sober to a fault.</p>
            <p>In other ways he was typical of men of his time. He was a private all the way and never forgot that
                    fact. He deeply resented the privileges of officers and especially the belief of so many officers
                    that the men were too stupid to understand almost anything. Although he was an officer himself in
                    World War II, Baker could not forget that he had been treated as though he were incompetent
                    twenty-five years before. On occasion his narrative is bitter, and time after time he recites how he
                    and his fellow "bucks"—buck privates—feigned stupidity,
                    often to excellent effect. He also was typical in remembering the old saw that there is a right way
                    to do something, a wrong way, and the army way. The procedures of the army struck him, as they did
                    so many of his fellow soldiers, as peculiar to the point of idiocy. And he was immensely proud of
                    how, when the action came, turning from warm to hot, the procedures of RHIP (rank has its
                    privileges) dropped off, the bucks took over, and their judgment and heroism won the
                    war—not the army's way.</p>
            <p>Baker was justly proud of the Thirty-second Division. When the army expanded in World War I from a
                    virtual constabulary of a little over one hundred thousand officers and men to a massive force of
                    four million within a year and a half, West Pointers and other regulars continued to believe that
                    they were the men who counted, the saving remnant. Feeling between regulars and National Guard
                    officers and men ran high, and the more so because almost without exception senior guard officers
                    lost their commands to regulars once troops arrived in <placeName>

                    National Guard divisions, such as the Thirty-second, were not as good. In fact the Thirty-second saw
                    a great deal of action and performed very well, and they should have proved—the lesson
                    was available but forgotten between the world wars—that the nonprofessionals were as good
                    as the regulars.</p>
            <p>The soldier memoirs of World War I are not easy to measure because there are so many of them. But it
                    is difficult to find memoirs any better than Baker's. For Indiana the only comparable
                    accounts are those of Elmer W. Sherwood, published as a narrative in 1919 and as a diary ten years
                    later. Sherwood's books were announced as remarkable both by Booth Tarkington and in 1929
                    by General Charles P. Summerall, former commander of V Corps and by then chief of staff of the U.S.
                    Army, although Sherwood's diary was bowdlerized so badly that it is in need of
                    republication. The diary of Indiana's Elmer Frank Straub also stands high on any list of
                    World War I books, although it begins slowly and takes on flair only toward the end. Among the

                            <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, the second child of Charles and Mary
                    Baker, August 5, 1896. My older brother, Walker Willis was born in Wolcott, Indiana on December 3,
                    1894, and my sister Madge at Otterbein, Indiana, 1900.</p>
            <p>In 1901 we moved to a farm 8 miles southwest of Wolcott. Here I started to school in the fall of
                    1902. A small country school having three of us in the first grade. I went to this school until
                    December, when we moved to another farm a mile and a quarter southwest of Wolcott and I was
                    transferred to what to us was a very large school, having eight rooms in a two story building. No
                    inside plumbing however, that was to come later when we moved to <placeName>

            <p>As fate ordained, I was born just at the right time to get into the first World War. I will never
                    know whether I was born just at the right time to get into it, or whether it was started just at the
                    right time to get me, but either way, we got together. Like most kids of the correct age, [I] just
                    couldn't wait. At the beginning of the war, "Hank" and I were in school
                    in a city some distance from our home town, and as was usual at the time, were interested in this
                    war as a rather distant excitement. Our heroes were the fliers, so when the war came we immediately
                    decided that we wanted to be fliers, but being very naive, thought that all we had to do was go to
                    some recruiting station and the army would jump at the chance of getting us to fly one of their
                    'aeroplanes.' Well, we soon found out that it was not that simple. If we were to
                    get to fly one of their planes we had to know somebody, say like a governor or a senator or at least
                    a judge, to endorse us. Then, if we passed the physical and moral examinations, they might consider
                    us. We were crestfallen and disgusted and ready to pass the army up and let them fight their war
                    without us, when the recruiting sergeant gave us a bit of what he must have thought was sage advice.
                    Since the flying part of the army was a branch of the Signal Corps, we should consider joining the
                    Signal Corps, and then transferring to the flying section. We went home and talked this idea <list type="footnotes">

                    had decided we did not want to be in the infantry. After mulling the idea over a while we decided to
                    give the Signal Corps a try, so we went looking for a recruiting station for the Signal Corps. We
                    found it in the form of a National Guard recruiting station, who assured us they could sign us in
                    the signal battalion and that we could put in an application to transfer to the flying section after
                    we had been in a short time. That recruiting sergeant would tell you anything just to get your name
                    on the dotted line. We signed, and the atmosphere changed at once. Now we were in, we were told, not
                    asked. We were told we could go home and stay there until we were called, which would be in about a
                    month, and that we should be ready to leave on orders so we were to be ready at all times, and were
                    not to leave on any extended trips so as not to be readily contacted.</p>
            <p>We went home and in due time received notice to report at such and such a place at such and such a
                    time.</p>
            <p>Well, it was a little sooner than we had expected. But since the war was moving along maybe they had
                    had to speed things up a bit so we decided to accommodate them, even though it had interfered with a
                    fishing trip of a few days.</p>
            <p>Upon arrival at the armory where we had been ordered to report, we were introduced to an old army
                    custom, hurry up and wait, stand in line and wait. After standing around most of the day we were
                    told we could sleep in the armory on a cot or go out to a hotel, or home, just so we were back by
                    seven o'clock in the morning. We chose a hotel. Most of the men lived in the city so went
                    home. Next morning we arrived on time and after waiting around for two or three more hours got on a
                    train and started for our camp site, some 70 miles from the city. We arrived at camp in the evening,
                    were lined up again and marched to our tents. Fortunately some one had already set them up,
                    otherwise we would probably slept in the open that night.</p>
            <p>After having been in camp all of half an hour we were lined up again and my name was called and I was
                    advised that I was on guard duty. That was what you got for having a name that started with a letter
                    at the first of the alphabet, B for instance. Later we decided the reason for this was that most
                    sergeants had never learned their "letters" in school beyond C, so each day in
                    making up details they always started with A and rarely got beyond C.</p>
            <p>With 5 or 6 other would-be soldiers who knew about as much as I did about it, we were marched off to
                    the guard tent to join other unlucky souls. At the guard tent we were lined up again and assigned
                    the hourly shifts we would be actually walking on duty. I drew, or rather was assigned, hours 10:00
                    to 12:00 pm and 2:00 to 4:00 am, told to stay at the guard tent and be ready at our assigned hours.
                    I had a bunk in the guard tent, but sleeping was impossible. I had no idea what I was in for.</p>
            <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-097-1-039"/>
            <p>Punctually at 10 minutes before 10:00 we were lined up and marched off to duty, the four in my group
                    went to the back of the camp ground and were told we were to guard the camp at the side we were
                    covering and were to prevent any intruders from entering or insiders from leaving. In my ignorance I
                    asked the corporal in charge of us how we were to stop anyone who wished to come in or leave, he
                    looked at me in a very superior manner and said, why you challenge them—you say
                    "Stop! Who goes there? Advance and be recognized." Then, in my ignorance, I
                    blurted out "But what if they don't stop?" That stumped the corporal, for
                    in his book all challenged people stop. Then finding himself, since he did not want to be shown up
                    by a common "buck" private with one day's experience, he said
                    "you call the Corporal of the Guard." Well, that sounded OK to me. I was willing
                    to pass the buck and responsibility on to him. But I wondered how far the ones we were trying to
                    stop would be gone by the time the corporal got there, but decided that was his worry, not mine.</p>
            <p>This was a sad night, walking back and forth over a given course about two hundred feet long through
                    eight inch high grass that was wet with dew when you started and got wetter by the minute. By the
                    end of term I was soggy wet up to my knees, and remember, was still in civilian
                    clothes—still wearing light oxfords.</p>
            <p>We were relieved at twelve and marched back to the guard tent to rest till 2:00 am when we were to go
                    back for some more. I took off my shoes and socks—wrung the socks out and hung them up to
                    dry. At two o'clock they were back and we went back to the same spot, and went through the
                    same agony all over again. At four o'clock we were relieved again and told to stay at the
                    guard tent until six, at which time we were dismissed and advised that we had the day off to rest.</p>
            <p>My first day in the army was to be remembered but not looked back upon as a day to be fondly
                    remembered.</p>
            <p>True to their word, I was not molested all of my second day however at chow time I learned what the
                    mess call on the bugle sounded like and was introduced to the army main stay in the food department,
                    "slum." It is made, as far as I can remember, as follows. Take a 35 or 40 gallon
                    GI can, fill it about 1/3 full of water, preferably clean, and heat to boil. Into this put about 40
                    or 50 lbs of chopped up beef in chunks about bite size, to some as big as your fist, about half a
                    bushel of potatoes, (this is the amount left over from a bushel after a KP has peeled a bushel),
                    these are cut into bite sizes also. Then carrots and onions and any other vegetables that may be
                    lying around. You boil this mess until a potato feels more or less soft. Then you take a large iron
                    skillet, put in a good supply of lard, melt it and get it hot, then add a goodly supply of flour to
                    the grease and heat over a hot fire, stirring vigorously until the flour is brown and dump into the
                    boiling mess in this GI can. The result is a brown gooey mess that will stick to your ribs, mess
                    plate, clothes or anything else it happens to <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-097-1-040"/>

            <p>On the third day we were all lined up in front of our tents early in the morning, so we may be
                    counted and answer to our names, alphabetically of course. I guess this was to see that no one had
                    gotten disgusted and taken off the night before.</p>
            <p>Here again my name got me in bad, starting with Ba I was first in line and sure enough, first name
                    called for detail, rations detail. What that was I had no idea, neither did the three others, but we
                    soon found out that we were to get in a wagon and ride over to the rations dump and draw the rations
                    for the battalion for that day. Now the rations dump was about a mile from our camp site, on a
                    railroad spur along which a platform had been built.</p>
            <p>On to this platform provisions were unloaded and then divided up for the various organizations of the
                    division. Our battalion had a small sign over the area assigned to it. When we arrived the sergeant

                    pile of groceries and said there it is, take it away, so we loaded it on our wagon, which was none
                    too clean, and the bread was unwrapped, but never the less we piled it in the wagon and went back to
                    the camp. Here we delivered it to the company kitchens, in quantities equal to their size.</p>
            <p>It may be well here to tell you how our battalion was made up. There were four companies. First was
                    the Headquarters Company. It was small consisting of about fifteen to twenty men. Next there were
                    three service companies, Co. A, which had approximately 150 men in it, Co. B about the same number,
                    but Co. C had about 300 men in it. I was in Headquarters Company. I presume my name had something to
                    do with that also, starting as it did with a B.</p>
            <p>When we got back to the company after the groceries were delivered, the sergeant called me into the
                    headquarters tent and said, do you think you could deliver the rations, and I said I thought I
                    could, and he said you are on permanent rations detail. I said "all by myself?"
                    and he said no, each morning at 7:00 AM a wagon and driver will be here for you and three other men
                    to help. You are responsible to see that the rations are delivered. That was all the instructions.
                    There was that fatal name again, beginning with a B. How else could you explain it otherwise.</p>
            <p>It didn't turn out to be so bad however, because being on permanent detail I was excused
                    from all other details. I would not have to walk guard, stand reveille, take exercise in the wet
                    cold grass in the morning, or do any of the routine training exercises. Life was sweeter.</p>
            <p>Things went along for a week or two. The operation of rations delivery rather smoothed out, except a
                    wrangle every day with the mess sergeants each of which seemed to think he was being short changed,
                    which of course was not the case, at least as far as we were concerned. The mess sergeants were
                    particularly touchy about the meat, sugar and syrup. As it was set up, A and B companies each got a
                    quarter of beef each day and C company got two quarters. This worked out so that A and B company got
                    a front quarter on alternate days and of course C got a front and hind quarter each day.</p>
            <p>Each company mess sergeant was after me to get him more sugar, canned milk, cookies. There was
                    nothing I could do about it, or at least so I thought, until we four rations flunkies began to get
                    army wise. We soon learned that by being very helpful at the dock like helping the QM
                    "bucks" in distributing the various groceries and unloading the refrigerator cars
                    we could accidentally put certain things in our truck instead of where they were supposed to be.
                    These things usually turned out to be a hind quarter of beef instead of a front, or a 50 pound bag
                    of sugar or a gallon of syrup, a case of milk or jelly or jams.</p>
            <p>I will have to admit that we probably favored A Company a bit with these goodies since that is where
                    we ate, and that it also paid <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-097-1-042"/> back in kind every once in a while
                    as the mess sergeant got me into the back end of the cook tent every once in a while where we
                    enjoyed a steak or other goodies never enjoyed by the buck privates and on a par with any officer in
                    the field. My first lesson in the army—don't be too particular and a little back
                    scratching usually pays off.</p>
            <p>After being in camp a week or ten days we were issued a uniform. As usual, lined up and marched over
                    to QM tent in which the "cottons" as they were called, were piled presumably in
                    sizes, shirts, pants, leggings, and socks and shoes. As we marched by they threw a shirt, hat, pants
                    and leggings and socks at you; when they got down to shoes, they did give you credit for knowing
                    what size you wore, and then gave you the next half size larger. They didn't give you any
                    underwear. Whether they assumed you didn't wear it or that you had your own I will never
                    know.</p>
            <p>About half an hour after the issue was over I think one of the largest exchanges of clothing ever
                    existed started and went on for the next twenty-four hours. Being a more or less standard size, I
                    made out very well on the whole.</p>
            <p>Things went on rather smoothly for a week or two when one day we got orders to strip for physical and
                    shots. It turned out that the physical was to be given in a small farm house on the camp grounds
                    about a mile from our tent site. Here we were all lined up in front of our tents ready to go when
                    some bright officer discovered that the sandy rocky field between us and the farm house was also
                    covered with sand spurs which were hell on bare feet, so we were permitted to get our shoes. After
                    another half hour delay we got on our way to the farm house, by this time the sun was well up and
                    hot, so 500 of us strung out over a field, naked as jay birds, headed for a small house, capable of
                    holding no more that fifteen or twenty, with the examining crew with equipment, inside at one time.
                    The rest stood out in the sun getting redder by the minute. This was some very poor planning by
                    someone in charge, but this we were soon to learn was par for the course.</p>
            <p>Upon entering the house we were given a battery of orders, such as bend over, spread your buttocks,
                    stand straight on one leg, on the other, open your mouth, say aah, raise your arms, take a full
                    breath, let it out, raise your right arm, wham—a needle in it, raise your left arm,
                    another needle, scratch till it bled—a dab of vaccine, and advice not to wipe that arm.
                    All this in a constant walk between two rows of medicos, out the front door of the house, and no
                    orders as to whether that was all or where to go. So we stood around in the hot sun and after about
                    two minutes one keeled over, "dead out" from strain and heat, soon another, then
                    another, and altogether there must have been close to seventy-five or eighty on the ground. We drug
                    them over and put them in the shade of a couple of trees in front of the house. After a while each
                    would come to, sit up and look foolish. After a short time some officer came out and said we were to
                    go back to <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-097-1-043"/> our tents. This was unusual to give a bunch of
                    enlisted men credit for enough intelligence to find their way back home. I guess the officers felt
                    fairly secure in turning a bunch of buck privates loose alone to find their way home a mile across a
                    field in plain sight, and especially since they had no clothes. We were to all report back in one
                    week to check on our vaccination; mine didn't take so I had to go through the whole
                    business again in a week.</p>
            <p>Life rather settled in for a time except the camp was overrun by visiting friends, relatives and girl
                    friends. This kind of curtailed our activities as far as dressing and trips to the latrine was
                    concerned when under normal circumstances certain clothing was considered unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Time passed, all types of rumors were always flying around, but finally one began to emerge as a
                    dominant theme. We were going to move about every place in the U.S. but it finally settled down to
                    some place in the south, but to every place from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. Things were quite confused, but as time passed the weather got colder where we were,
                    and when ice began to form on our water bucket at night we were ready to move. But no one seemed to
                    know where.</p>
            <p>Finally one day an order came. Pack to move, nothing but army issue was to be taken. Now over the
                    period of time that we had been in this camp a lot of junk had accumulated in the way of sweaters,
                    mufflers, gloves, socks etc., from doting mothers and girl friends. The pile of junk was astounding,
                    and could no way be hid in a standard army back pack.</p>
            <p>At last we were lined up and marched over to the train. It looked good, made up of Pullman cars which
                    would indicate a long ride. Also there were to be only three men to a compartment, two to the lower
                    bunk and one in the upper with the excess equipment, such as back packs, etc. Actually the two in
                    the lower had the best, but as we got shaken into place quite comfortable. Intervals in the train
                    were interspaced baggage cars equipped as kitchens.</p>
            <p>After three or four days and nights of riding we finally arrived at our destination, and we were not
                    real sure where we were then, but had deduced from the information gleaned from casual conversation
                    with locals at the rail stations along the way that we must be some place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. Why all the secrecy we didn't know, but information was scarce. At least for
                    us.</p>
            <p>We were shunted on to a siding at the camp, unloaded and marched to our tents. It turned out that
                    they were an improvement over the last camp, the tents even had board floors in them and one
                    electric light, about twenty-five watts.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>When everything you own is either on your back in a pack or you are wearing it, it usually does not
                    take long to move in. We were all settled in about forty-five minutes, with old rumors taking up
                    just where they left off when we left the old camp.</p>
            <p>One rumor that persisted was that we were going to be mounted. Why, no one seemed to have the
                    slightest idea, and wondered why. Imagine riding a horse around a front line filled with trenches,
                    and fox holes. Even the officers couldn't be that dumb—even the higher up ones.
                    But in a couple of weeks we got horses, and a picket line and the whole mess that goes with them. It
                    turned out, however, there were not horses for everyone, just enough for the officers to ride and
                    the dog-robbers to take care of.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things moved along more or less smoothly for two or three weeks, then lightning struck as far as I
                    was concerned—the sergeant came to me one morning and said "You have a
                    horse." And I said "Me? I can't have a horse, I am just a buck private.
                    No buck private has a horse. Besides, I don't want a horse. I already have four mules and a
                    wagon to take care of, and that is all I need or want." Sarg just says, "You
                    don't have to take care of them, you got a helper and now you got a horse whether you want
                    one or not." And I said "What officer owned the horse, and why can't his
                    dog-robber take care of his horse like all the rest do?" Sarg just said it does not belong
                    to anyone, so now it is yours. "What is the matter with it?" I asked.
                    "Nothing as far as I know," said Sarg, "except it needs cleaning up and a
                    little feed. It is tied up in the stall down by the equipment shed at the end of the company street,
                    better go down and get acquainted."</p>
            <p>I went down to see what had been foisted off on me and why. A buck private with a horse just
                    couldn't be—there had to be a catch some place, and there was.</p>
            <p>This horse turned out to be the meanest looking horse I had ever laid eyes on. I mean he had an evil
                    eye, and when I got close to him he took a bite at me. He missed, but not far and I heard his teeth
                    snap. This horse was no animal to get careless with. I circled around him and he took a kick at me.
                    After carefully scrutinizing him, I decided he must have been dreadfully mistreated and was fighting
                    back. He was always on the defensive, he had had no care and known no gentle treatment.</p>
            <p>First he had to be cleaned up, the army would insist on that. I went back up to company headquarters
                    and asked Sarg who was <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>in one of the new tent camps. The arrangement worked fairly well, save for the tent camps

                            ranges, found the tent camp almost unbearable. For Baker's first sight of a

                    and they had thought I might know about horses. (How wrong they were).</p>
            <p>I sat around and thought about it for a while, then went over to the kitchen and wrangled an apple
                    away from Cookie and took it down to "Pinto." I decided to call him
                    "Pint" [sic] for lack of anything better. He was wary of any gesture of kindness,
                    but hunger won out and he actually took the apple from my hand, and not my hand with it. He even let
                    me touch his nose, but little. I hung around him for a time and then fed him a bucket of oats in his
                    manger feed box and put some hay in his manger, and brought him a bucket of water. He drank it as if
                    he hadn't seen water for a week, so I gave him a second bucket and left him for the night.</p>
            <p>Next morning he didn't seem quite so hostile, another apple helped. I decided it was time to
                    try to curry him and give him a good cleaning up, however remembering my first meeting, decided not
                    to trust too far. I tied his head solidly to the manger so he couldn't bite, second
                    maneuvered around the stall side, reached through and got a rope tied around his front leg and
                    jerked it out from under him and tied it up so he only had three legs to stand on. It seems as
                    though a horse has trouble trying to kick standing on three legs, he loses his balance trying to
                    stand on two legs and kick at the same time. He also has trouble trying to kick sideways, so if you
                    want to get struck by a horse or kicked, you must get in front of him or in back.</p>
            <p>After spending the larger part of two months in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, camp rumors began to circulate about a move overseas, also about losing our horses. It
                    seems the generals in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had finally decided that horses would not be such a good idea in trench warfare even if
                    they were indispensable during the Civil War. This was a new war with telephone communication. As I
                    had anticipated, one day Sarge had me come into his tent to tell me that Pint would be taken away.
                    They did, but they got a lot different horse than had been brought to me. All I could hope for was
                    that he got a good home.</p>
            <p>As rumors usually did, they materialized eventually, so in the first week of December we were marched
                    over to a train again, loaded into Pullmans and headed generally in a northeasterly direction, but
                    not a word was said as to where we were going.</p>
            <p>After seven days on the train we were unloaded and marched to a two story barracks building heated by
                    a big furnace in the middle of the first floor with heating pipes going to the second story. We

                    was just too cold.</p>
            <p>Two days later we were loaded on to a ship—a big ship. By rumor grapevine we were on the
                    White Star liner, <hi rend="i">Baltic</hi>, English. You knew it wasn't American the minute
                    one stepped on. We were marched to our stateroom. I think they marched us there to see we did not
                    desert when we saw our so called stateroom. This room was one floor below what appeared to be the
                    first open deck, the room itself was six feet wide, eight feet long and about six and one half feet
                    high. Into this space six of us with all our gear were packed. Two bunks on either side, two across
                    the end. This gave us a dressing space in the middle two feet wide and four feet long. No toilet of
                    course, it was one deck up and a real horror; about twenty feet square, toilets along one side and a
                    urinal trough along the other. Half of the toilet seats were broken or missing entirely, the other
                    toilets were plugged up and over flowing. They could only be used by standing on them, which was
                    being done, or not used at all, just the floor. There was about an inch of water and raw sewage
                    sloshing around on the floor. It was a horror. After being on board about three or four days an
                    officer came around and asked how everything was, he heard, nothing happened.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The night after we boarded the ship we took off and went north to what we heard was <placeName>

                    sizes of ships was assembled and on the second night we put off, moving slowly since no one could go
                    faster than the slowest ship, which we learned was about 8 knots.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After our first night aboard we were herded to the mess hall, a large room full of mess tables with a
                    serving table at one end. For our first breakfast we got a bowl and a spoon; into the bowl was
                    slapped a gob of cold oatmeal, a small amount of canned milk, two small pieces of bacon so cold it
                    was turning white as the fat congealed, a cup of cold tea with a little bit of sugar, and a slice of
                    bread. Nothing else. For the next 13 or 14 days exactly the same thing. Of course there was plenty

                            over to convoys, abandoning all effort—save for ships capable of outsailing enemy
                            submarines—to encourage single sailers. In the spring of 1917 losses to
                            submarines became intolerable and something had to be done. But convoys, though almost 100
                            percent safe, were inefficient. As Baker related, each ship had to reduce its speed to that
                            of the slowest vessel. Moreover it was necessary to gather ships in port, which was
                            time-consuming. And when a convoy arrived it frequently overwhelmed the facilities of the

                    were plenty of gulls available. On an occasion or two we got fish, and it never varied while we were

            <p>After we had been on ship for thirteen days one of the men who had been out on deck just at dusk to
                    get a breath of fresh air before ducking to our stinking stateroom announced that land was visible
                    on both sides of the ship, so we decided that we must be at the narrowest point between <placeName>

                    heavy thud. We rushed out on deck and someone said the ship just back of us had been torpedoed and
                    that the torpedo had been meant for us being the largest ship in the convoy. All of a sudden there
                    was much activity with small torpedo boats racing around dropping depth charges. They never got the
                    submarine as far as I ever heard, but they were having a lot of activity for a while. Our ship put
                    on speed and soon pulled out of sight of the damaged ship in the fast fading evening light. Next

                            another in the convoy was in danger of being attacked by enemy submarines. If he saw
                            wreckage from sinkings, or ordinary flotsam, he identified a periscope. In the case of the

                            with loss of thirteen men. Other U.S. ships lost on the eastward trans-Atlantic run were the

                            Two broad lanes for convoys reached to Europe, with troopships taking a lane different from
                            ships carrying supplies. Troops usually went direct to <placeName>

                            Supply ships crossed far more frequently (one hundred supply ships to every troopship), and
                            were slower and less protected. Submarine commanders concentrated on them. The Germans also
                            believed that American troops, trained by officers with no experience on the western front,

                    </placeName> and I immediately went looking for the infirmary. When I had found it a couple of
                    doctors looked and said Ah! and loaded me in an ambulance and off I went to a hospital. There I was
                    put to bed with a mattress on it and clean white sheets. A couple of doctors came to see me, looked
                    at my throat, said Ah! disappeared and shortly were back with syringe needles big enough for a horse
                    and gave me shots on both sides of my stomach and left. Next morning I had water blisters as big as
                    my thumb all over my belly. The doctors came in, looked me over, said Ah! and left. I was warm and
                    sleepy, so the next thing I knew it was next morning, the welts on my belly were gone and the
                    soreness in my throat was better. The doctors came in, looked me over, said Ah! and left. There was
                    another day which didn't make me mad; clean and warm and reasonably good food. Another 24
                    hours passed and when I awakened the soreness was all gone from my throat, and I felt good. The
                    doctors came in, looked me over and said send him back to his outfit.</p>
            <p>This was the beginning of a bad time for me because my outfit had moved on during the two days
                    absence and I was now a casual. In the army a casual is just another way of saying you are going to
                    get the dirty end of a lot of work details, and doubly sure if your name starts with an A, B, or C.
                    So I say again, if you are thinking of joining the army as a buck change your name to start with an
                    X, Y or Z. No sergeant in the army ever got beyond ABC in the alphabet, so all details are made up
                    of bucks whose names start with A, B or C. My name started with B so I was the first to be sent
                    right back out to the hospital, this time as a KP, kitchen police, peeling potatoes. After a week of
                    this a promotion was forthcoming. I got promoted to dish washer. While the army was supposed not to
                    keep a man on constant detail for over 48 hours, they forgot the regulations and kept on all the
                    help they could get, always asking for more. I found out that if you did a reasonably good job you
                    were kept on and on, the way to get gone was to be dumb, undependable, and lazy. But I
                    didn't get smart fast enough.</p>
            <p>In the evenings we sat around the kitchen table and played cards. At first not much gambling, as no
                    one had much money. I didn't have a cent. Finally there was a pay day for everyone but me,
                    being a casual, with no known home. The kitchen help feeling sorry for me made a pot of 7 shillings
                    so I could join the game. This game lasted all night, and in the morning my 7 shillings had grown to
                    over $350 as I found out when I took it down to the base post office the next day and
                    sent $300 home to my father to put in the bank for me. The next night a new game started.
                    I went to bed, there were a lot more dishes to be washed the next day.</p>
            <p>This went on for weeks. Ever so often I went to the casual office and asked to be sent back to my
                    company, always got the same answer from the sergeant—in a day or two. Time went on,
                    every few days a <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-097-1-049"/> couple of us would walk into the city and walk
                    around looking the town over, also <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>
                    </placeName> Cathedral, a very noteworthy edifice said to have been built in the 1100 hundreds. I
                    was in it a number of times and got to know one of the caretakers who liked to show us around and
                    tell us the history, and of the repairs and changes that had been made over the years. Just at that
                    time they were doing quite extensive repairs, shoring up the foundation. It seems according to the
                    caretaker the original building was built on oak pilings in low marshy land, and in the last two
                    hundred years or so the marsh had dried out so the water was now some ten or twenty feet lower. The
                    tops of the oak pilings supporting the cathedral had dried out and rotted, letting the whole edifice
                    sink approximately four feet. At first running abutments were built along the side to brace up the
                    walls, but this had been deemed inadequate, so now an effort was being made to pour concrete pilings
                    inside the church, which they were in the process of doing. Some 40 years later I visited the
                    cathedral. It was still standing, so the latter method of shoring it up must have been successful.</p>
            <p>My social life with the opposite sex had gone to pot, and as I had struck up a "cross the
                    counter" acquaintance with a girl about my age who worked in a tobacco shop which her
                    father owned, but was run by her and her mother. Her father was on duty during nights in the home
                    guards, a sort of police organization, for the duration. All the regular police were in the army.
                    After one consultation with mother it was agreed that I might escort the young lady home after work.
                    We took a short walk in a park along the <geogName>Itchen River</geogName> which ran through town,
                    and then cut through the cathedral grounds which were completely enclosed by a high stone wall and
                    heavy iron gates, which were closed and locked at about 10:00 pm at night, a fact I was not aware
                    of. We arrived at her home through some winding narrow streets, all very dark, except for some very
                    well shaded gas street lights about every two blocks. After arriving at her home we sat around and
                    talked about America. They seemed to have some very vague ideas concerning the U.S. Later mother
                    served some tea and cookies, called biscuits by them, and I was off to find the camp the best I
                    could.</p>
            <p>I started out to retrace my way to the cathedral gates, but when I got there they were closed, locked
                    and very dark. I decided that if the cathedral wall could be followed eventually I would come out on
                    the other side. Unfortunately this couldn't be done, no street followed the wall, but led
                    off in all directions it seemed to me, so I wandered around trying to go west till I hit High Street
                    which I knew. After wandering around for some time I stopped to get my bearings if possible when a
                    faint sound of heavy diesel engines could be heard sounding as if they were coming from above.
                    Looking up could be seen the silhouette of a German Zeplin heading to the northwest toward the
                    industrial heart of <placeName>

                    height of the fight- <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-097-1-050"/> er planes of that day. I watched for a time
                    till it went out of sight, then resumed my hunt for High Street which was eventually found and I
                    arrived home about 2:00 o'clock. That was the end of my social life in <placeName>

                    casual office where I always got the same answer, in a day or two. One day I happened in and an
                    officer was in the office and he asked how long I had been on special duty away from my outfit. When
                    I told him three months, he said "What!" and turned to the sergeant and said get
                    this man out and the next day notice came for me to report to casual headquarters. When I arrived
                    the orders were ready for me to report to 107th Aero Squadron maintenance in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. So there was quite an argument while I tried to convince the powers in the office that
                    I did not belong to the 107th Aero Squadron but to the 107th Field Signal Battalion and that it was
                    in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. This finally accomplished I was told to come in the next day.</p>
            <p>I went out to the hospital and put my things together, said my goodbys, wished the poor
                    "buck" who had been assigned my beginners job of peeling potatoes good luck, with
                    a little good advice on how to get away unless he liked the job.</p>

                    </placeName> were lined up with our packs on our backs with a "90 day wonder"
                    second lieutenant in charge.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> He did not have to carry a pack. We started to
                    walk, no one ever told us where we were going, how far or anything. We had been given a small
                    package, which turned out to be a sandwich and an apple. We were also told to fill up our canteens.
                    After much map study we finally chose a road and started walking, and kept walking all day. By 4
                    o'clock in the afternoon our poor lieutenant was pretty well bushed and he didn't
                    even have a pack to carry. Finally we came to a little town in which there was a contingent of U.S.
                    soldiers. We were turned over and the lieutenant disappeared. We twelve casuals were assigned bunks,
                    so after we were fed we went to bed sure the next day we would move on.</p>
            <p>Next morning we rousted out early for breakfast, you guessed it, oatmeal and coffee, but it was made
                    in a U.S. GI kitchen and hot. After breakfast, we were called out, front and center, for detail,
                    which was regular routine with "bucks" present, and as usual if your name started
                    with A, B or C you were called first. I was put on guard duty at a double gate which as far as I
                    could see really closed off nothing, was used by everybody that was going that way. I was told to
                    guard the gate, I never did find out who I was to guard it from, or what. On duty, two hours on, two

                    first time in three weeks. Most of the men who had walked down to this town with me were among this
                    bunch.</p>
            <p>Next morning after a breakfast of oatmeal and coffee and a slice of bacon, of all things, we were put
                    on a train, third class of course, and were on our way to Southampton. Why any
                    "buck" private was put on a train to go only a few miles, walking distance of a
                    day, is more than we could figure out, we decided the army must be losing its grip or someone made a
                    mistake. Anyhow, when we got to our destination and into a barracks building, we could not figure
                    out why we were not immediately called out for a potato peeling detail or a dish washing stint, but
                    after a couple of hours laying around it became apparent, we were called out and marched down to a
                    dock, and onto a medium sized ship. Here we went down two decks, both of which were filled with
                    horses and mules. It was easy to figure out who was to be taken care of first in case of trouble
                    with German bombs, which the army thought was more valuable, horses and mules or
                    "buck" privates.</p>
            <p>We went down two decks and arrived in what appeared to be a mess hall, at least the large room was
                    partially divided into two rooms, the one we went into had two tables in it. These were picnic type
                    tables, substantially built, with seat boards running full length down either side. In the other
                    half of the room were already arrived our traveling companions, who were as far as we could
                    determine, English army Moroccan soldiers, at least they had on English army uniforms. With that
                    each one wore a turban instead of a regulation English army hat and a sash about his waist in which
                    he carried the most evil looking long curved knife one could imagine. They looked like someone you
                    should be friends with, no hostilities. We started in at once to be friendly even if we could not
                    understand a word they said.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Along about four o'clock in the afternoon we were called out to eat, two decks up and a few
                    feet from our ladder down was a kitchen, and just beyond that was apparently the mess hall, in which
                    was a hastily put together mess facility. The mess we were served was also put together in a hurry,
                    fried greasy potatoes, a piece of meat of some kind, we decided it was horse that had been either
                    starved or worked to death, bread, one slice, and a cup of lukewarm tea. We were in <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-097-1-052"/> this place for an hour or better and the Moroccans were not with
                    us. If what they got was no better than ours, I would not like the job of serving them after seeing
                    those knives they had.</p>
            <p>When we finally left the mess hall we went out on deck and it was dark. As we sauntered back toward
                    our deck ladder I noticed a tall can sitting on the deck outside of the kitchen door. It had
                    apparently been set there to cool the contents. We filed back down our ladders and sat down around a
                    table after taking our packs off and piling them in a corner.</p>
            <p>We hadn't been seated very long before we heard a clanking and shuffling of feet. Apparently
                    someone was coming down the ladders in a hurry and carrying an object of some kind. We soon found
                    out—here came one of the "bucks" toting the cooking container that had
                    been outside the kitchen door, and he was yelling, "Hide it quick!" We did, it
                    went under the pile of backpacks we had just piled in the corner. We all sat down at the dining
                    table and began to talk, the Arabs looking on. We did not have to sit long when down the ladder came
                    what must have been the ship's chef, or at least the head cook, looking around and
                    demanding where it was. We of course were all innocence, no one knew anything in true
                    "buck" manner. The guy took one glance at the Moroccans, each with his hand on the
                    handle of his long curved knife, and decided to call it a day as far as he was concerned.</p>
            <p>After a short time, and a little reconnoitering above decks, we investigated what we had obtained in
                    our can. It turned out to be a beef stew, still hot and good. We each filled our mess kits, over
                    half was left, so we gave it to the Arabs and they seemed very happy with it. I wondered how they
                    ate it without a fork or spoon, but they seemed to get along OK with three fingers, and we made
                    friends for life.</p>
            <p>Shortly after we had finished our dinner the ship began to move, and a bit later we went on deck and
                    we were in the channel. Black, not a light in sight. We went down to our room and got as comfortable
                    for the night as possible. I got a bench to sleep on, not too bad, but not to be recommended either.</p>
            <p>Next morning we were in a harbor and docked, awakened, marched off to a camp and breakfast. You
                    guessed it, oatmeal, almost warm, with coffee and a bit of canned milk. Back at the barracks the
                    usual happened, detailed to the kitchen and potatoes to be peeled. Here we had only butcher knives
                    to peel with. Peeling a potato with a butcher knife is not the easiest thing in the world, the
                    potatoes turned out square by the time we were finished. The wonder is that the mess sergeant
                    didn't make us peel the peelings over again.</p>
            <p>Next day we were loaded on a train in the third class car, of course, and started off toward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some time later we arrived at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> terminal and ordered out, and taken to the U.S.A. office, told not to leave, but soon
                    felt the need of a rest room. After a little inquiry we found it, but could hardly believe that men
                    and women used the same doors to enter, contrary to American teachings. Upon <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-097-1-053"/> entering, we found ourselves in one large room with a T division
                    through the center. Men right women left. Upon getting into the men's half we found the one
                    wall was completely covered by stalls about two and a half to three feet deep, no door in front and
                    the only fixture being a hole in the floor about five inches in diameter, that was all. Later I had
                    an opportunity to look in the other side. The women were no better off than the men as far as
                    accommodations. Not to be cowed by lack of modern toilets, we entered the stall as many others were
                    doing. As might be expected, all had not hit the hole in the floor. It was a filthy place. After
                    having been in the cubby hole about so long, there appeared at the entrance an old woman with toilet
                    paper for sale, holding out three or four sheets of paper, obviously out of a sales catalogue, and
                    saying one sou. She made no sale to us. Any "buck" with one weeks service had
                    learned to carry his own paper in goodly quantities, it has many uses. It must have been pretty
                    tough on a guy without a sou, but it was obvious how he overcame the dilemma by cleaning his finger
                    on the stall wall, and took pride in who could make his mark the highest. We arrived at the
                    conclusion there must be a lot of tall Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>We all collected back at the U.S.A. canteen where you could buy American candy bars, cookies,
                    cigarettes, etc. We got a good supply of all, pockets full, which was a wise move. We never saw a
                    U.S.A. mess hall for two days. We sat around the U.S.A. office for a while when a sergeant took us
                    out into the section of the terminal where you boarded the train to your destination. We were taken
                    way back and put into a third class passenger coach, no one ever heard of a "buck"
                    riding in any other class, and told not to leave it, the car would be picked up later. We sat around
                    the car for a time with all types of cars coming and being picked up. At last a flat car was pushed
                    on to the siding next to us. On this little flat car were loaded wine casks, three large ones first,
                    then two smaller ones, then on the top a cask of about 25 gallons.</p>
            <p>After the switch engine and brakeman had left, one of the men in the gang looked out and said,
                    "They have delivered the wine," and got up and went over to the flat car and came
                    back to report that the casks were full. We got a coopers pin somewhere and went back to the wine
                    casks and soon knocked the bung loose in the little cask on top, and brought back a cup of wine, the
                    type we call rouge, sour as vinegar, but wet. We all went over and filled our cups, and sat around
                    drinking it. When we had finished, we decided it would be easier to bring the little cask to our
                    car, than to keep going over to the flat car to fill our cups. With a bit of doing, we got the keg
                    mounted in the back of our 3rd class car.</p>
            <p>Later in the afternoon they parked a 1st class passenger car on the track next to us. Of course we
                    looked it over and decided it was superior to ours, cushions on the seats and seat backs, also lace
                    curtains at the windows—luxurious.</p>
            <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-097-1-054"/>
            <p>It was getting late in the afternoon so we decided since it looked as if we were going to have to
                    spend the night in the 3rd class car we would be much better on the cushions in the first class car
                    than on the hard benches of the 3rd class, so we pushed the first class car over on our switch and
                    the third class over where the first class had been. Cushioned seats make much better beds than
                    plain boards. By this time it was dark so we decided to turn in. Some time during the night we were
                    bumped around and connected to a train and headed out, where we did not know.</p>
            <p>Next morning, about 9 AM we were switched onto a side track, after sitting around about an hour a
                    Frenchman came along to ask us where we were going. He could speak a little English, and when we got
                    it through to him we were headed for Alsace, he threw up his hands and said we were almost to Brest,
                    just the opposite direction. After a while some other Frenchmen showed up, and a great palaver took
                    place. It was decided that we had to be sent back to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. An American sergeant came out to see us, asked a hundred questions and got no answers.
                    We were at our stupid best, we knew nothing, but asked no questions. We were put on another car, not
                    first class needless to say, and told to stay, but we pleaded we needed a rest room, so we were
                    given permission to go to the rest room, and incidentally use the canteen to replenish our candy,
                    cookies and cigarette supplies. Necessary since we had had nothing to eat but these for at least 24
                    hours.</p>
            <p>Sometime during the night we were moved out and started, someplace we hoped in the right direction,
                    and sometime the next morning we arrived at a small town, which we learned was in Alsace, the area
                    we were supposed to be trying to find. And to make everything fine for me, after sitting around for
                    some time, who should drive up but my old pal Hank Brucker, to haul us back to Division
                    Headquarters. Not necessary for me. I knew where I was going, we soon arrived at Headquarters
                    Battalion and I was home after 5 months of being a casual trying to get there—Army
                    efficiency.</p>
            <p>Going back to company Headquarters, was soon back to my own quarters. Assigned to a hay loft in a
                    convenient barn, complete with cows, rats, chickens and cooties. My first encounter with the big
                    lice that were everywhere, and with which I carried on a losing war for the next five months. After
                    being around for several days, being assigned a truck to drive, all my own, everything was just
                    right. I was bunked up in the barn hay loft with the rest of the company men. One night we kept
                    hearing a rat or some other rodent rooting around and snuffling around. Finally Hank got tired
                    listening to it, reached over, got one of his shoes and let fire in the general direction of the
                    noise. The noise stopped, but the next morning, look as we might, we never did find Hank's
                    shoe. Hank had a difficult time trying to explain to the supply sergeant why he only needed one new
                    shoe. It seems that regulations concerning the missing of one shoe, <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-097-1-055"/> and issuing of one shoe had never been written. Hank had to settle for
                    two shoes.</p>
            <p>Things went along for two or three days, when one morning I awoke with a sore throat, and I went over
                    to the sick bay to have it attended to. That was my mistake. The doc took one look, said
                    "ah" and in about two minutes I found myself in an ambulance off to the hospital.
                    The hospital was only three or four miles away, and was a church. The pews had been removed and iron
                    beds had replaced them. It was run by the French.</p>
            <p>Hadn't been there 5 minutes till a French doctor came in, looked at my throat, said
                    "ah" and soon came back with a syringe big enough for a horse, and gave me a
                    couple of shots in my belly, covered me up nicely in bed and left. In a few minutes a French nurse
                    came in and explained how she could speak English, which was a good thing or I never would have
                    suspected it. She also had a thermometer, a tongue depressor, a throat swab and iodine bottle. First
                    she handed me the thermometer and as I started to put it in my mouth as I had been taught to do, the
                    nurse grabbed it and started some wild gyrations, a chorus of voices from the G.I.s in the adjacent
                    beds all sang out at once "stick it in your ass." I learned from that that the
                    French have some strange ways.</p>
            <p>The next day my throat was better and I was feeling much better, and was introduced to French
                    cooking, that is, army style. You guessed it, oatmeal for breakfast, but with milk and sugar, warm,
                    really not bad. For lunch we had toast and soup, very thin, with a cabbage leaf in it, for dinner we
                    had toast, potato and some kind of meat, usually chicken or rabbit or maybe mutton.</p>
            <p>The menu never varied. One day at lunch one of the not so sick men called out "some one is
                    going to catch hell in the kitchen tonight, there are two cabbage leaves in my soup."</p>
            <p>Days passed. The same routine every day, the nurse came in, took my temperature, or I did, depressed
                    my tongue, took a swab, painted my throat with iodine, and said "positive." This
                    went on for three weeks, then one day she came in and said the doctors have decided you are a
                    natural carrier. I never did find out what I was a carrier of, but that made no difference, I was
                    sent back to my outfit. When I reported in to my company, the sergeant said, "I am sorry,
                    but we couldn't keep your place open any longer, you are transferred to Company
                    C," and out I went. I said good-by to Hank and out I went.</p>
            <p>Now Company C in our battalion was trained to install telephones in the field and to maintain lines
                    of communication on the front, and were farmed out to the infantry battalions or companies to keep
                    the company telephone [in] communication with battalion, other companies and regimental
                    headquarters, and on occasion with division, but not often, mostly between companies and battalion,
                    also outposts. All this so called training was supposed to be taking place while I was in <placeName>

                    was all any of them could do. I hadn't been at my new assignment but a day or two when the
                    supply sergeant called me in to see what was needed to get me up to combat supply shape. After
                    giving me a good going over he decided what was needed in my case was a tin kelly, gas mask, pliers,
                    45 automatic pistol, extra shells, dagger, electricians knife, first aid kit, friction tape, wire,
                    all hooked onto my web belt around my waist, along with my mess kit, cup and canteen.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In addition a French made field telephone, in a wooden box, wooden hinged top, and

                    in a moment or two another, then another looking as if they had been dragged off the road not too
                    long ago. I started counting, and counted 252 before we seemed to be entering a fair sized town. We
                    still did not know where. After driving a few more blocks we crossed a stream on a pontoon bridge
                    which appeared to be in the middle of a business district of a fair sized town. Soon after crossing
                    the bridge we made a left hand turn on a street about a hundred feet from the river and in a few
                    blocks were in a residential district, pulled up in front of a nice looking house. As we unloaded
                    the sergeant in charge yelled at us to be careful of "booby traps" since there had
                    not been time to search the houses. The house ten or twelve of us had been assigned to had been a
                    nice home. It was equipped with good furniture, among which was a very ornate grand piano, not too
                    big, but ornate. The "hinies" who had just left the day before had done a good
                    hatchet job, all the pictures had been hacked, glass broken, legs chopped off tables and chairs, the
                    only reason that the piano legs hadn't was because they were too big and hard wood, but
                    they had tried. One of the big "boobies" with us rushed over and threw up the
                    piano top, then just stood there and growled, he looked as if he were paralyzed. I went over to the
                    piano and looked inside, and there on the strings lay a German "potato masher"
                    hand grenade. I didn't have any idea whether it had been triggered or not. Usually after
                    the trigger has been pulled you have three seconds to get rid of it, or it will get rid of you. I
                    dropped to the floor, but nothing happened; big "booby" stood there looking at it
                    and holding up the piano top. Finally I decided the trap had not been triggered, so I gingerly got
                    up to take a look, and told the guy holding up the piano top not to put it down as that might
                    trigger the hand grenade. I got up and looked the grenade over carefully and saw that it had been
                    wired with a very fine wire to a hammer on the piano keyboard. Had someone started to play the piano
                    and hit the right note he would have triggered the grenade, and he and the piano disappeared. After
                    very carefully examining the trap I had the G.I. holding up the piano top brace it up with the
                    regular top brace, and get away, and duck if I yelled duck. Very carefully I reached in with my
                    pliers and snipped the trigger wire in two, it just fell apart and the trigger pin never moved. Very
                    gingerly I reached in and picked up the "potato masher," carried it out the back
                    door, across the lawn, and pulled the trigger in the prescribed manner, and tossed it into the river
                    and ducked down on the bank. In a few moments it went off with a muffled roar and a great deal of
                    roiling water, and only one little fish about an inch and a half came floating to the top. Fish were
                    scarce in that particular spot in the river on that day, August 5, 1918, my birthday.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>After that episode, we gave the house a very good looking over indeed, no more traps, so we went down
                    the street for a couple of blocks to the field kitchen for some C rations, bread and a cup of
                        coffee.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Next morning we were routed out early and immediately after breakfast detailed to deliver a quite
                    large reel of phone wire to a company headquarters some place up the field.</p>
            <p>We looked that roll of wire over and decided it was too large to carry, so we started to scrounge
                    around looking for something to carry it on. We found an old spring wagon sort of contraption with
                    two hind wheels still intact and a pair of shafts available. We broke the rear two wheels and back
                    axle loose from the damaged body and arranged the coil of wire on the axle, then got the shaft wired
                    to the axle, found an old horse in a barn, hitched him to the two wheels and had a reasonable wire
                    reel cart, and started out to find the company we were supposed to deliver the wire to. After
                    walking and helping the poor old horse pull the reel of wire, for an interminable time, we arrived
                    at a small town on the outskirts of which was a small orchard associated with a farm house. Inside
                    of the fence around the orchard was a fresh grave which had rather been fixed up for an ordinary
                    soldier, but couldn't have been more than a few days old. It had been mounded up with a low
                    stick fence and at one end there was stuck in the ground the long end of a broken airplane
                    propeller, onto which had been tied the shorter end to form a rude cross, and on to this cross piece
                    there had been scratched the name Quentin Roosevelt, son of Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

               <item>Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, fixed upon a now-or-never strategy, a series of massive

                        outcome. At that time, the late winter, the AEF had hardly been in action, only a division or
                        two having served in the line, and then in training, taking part in no offensives or indeed
                        action beyond two box barrages put over by their German opponents in which the Americans
                        essentially were worsted, men killed and taken prisoner. The first of Ludendorff's
                        offensives began on March 21 and initially was a huge success, promising to divide the British
                        and French armies and roll the British forces up to the Channel, meanwhile taking <placeName>

                        </placeName>. Eventually it failed, only to be followed by four more lunges against the Allied
                        forces. The last of the offensives began on July 15 and came to a quick end. Three days after
                        its beginning two American divisions, the First and Second, together with a French Moroccan
                        division, jumped off against a salient, a wedge, into Allied lines in the vicinity of Soissons.
                        The counteroffensive, which ended on August 6, forced German withdrawal from the salient, albeit
                        at a large cost on both sides. It was the first major American battle against German troops, and
                        the inexperienced men of the AEF went forward in bunched formations, to be mowed down by
                        artillery and machine guns, sometimes in windrows. After Soissons a series of attacks forced the
                        German army back. On August 8, three days after Baker rode along the body-littered road he here
                        describes, the British moved forward in an offensive that at first stunned the German high
                        command. The truly large U.S. campaigns followed at St. Mihiel (September 12-16) and, by far the
                        larger, the Meuse-Argonne (September 26-November 11).</item>

            <p>Our wire was delivered, the poor old nag that had served us so well, if reluctantly, was turned loose
                    to get along the best way he could, and we headed back toward Chateau Thierry and something to eat
                    and a place to sleep. We had covered several miles we were "pooped out as we were carrying
                    our packs and all field equipment, as we did not know when we would be back, if ever, when we
                    started out that morning.</p>
            <p>The next morning we were routed out quite early, had breakfast, and loaded into trucks, and started
                    to a new destination, we knew not where. We were on the trucks two or three hours, when we suddenly
                    turned off the road and into what appeared to be a cave, but actually was a limestone quarry, old
                    and big. It appeared to have about the whole division in it, but of course there were not that
                        many.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> But there were a lot of men, and a large switch board with at least
                    twelve or fifteen telephone connections. We pulled up a short way inside the entrance, close to the
                    switch board. It was getting dark and we went out looking for a field kitchen, We could smell the
                    coffee. We didn't take long, and were back at our truck in a half hour or so. However in
                    the meantime night had settled and we felt lucky thinking we would be in a good quiet place.</p>
            <p>No luck. Hadn't been settled down for a rest more than 15 minutes when a call came for a
                    lineman, and out I went because a circuit was out. I traced it out of the entrance and up over the
                    slight hill over the cave entrance and slightly downward for about half a mile to a company switch
                    board, found a break about 100 feet from the company board, followed the wire on in to the company
                    board and for a while everything seemed OK. The headquarters was located in a dugout built by the
                    Germans, but really not intended for U.S.A. use.</p>
            <p>Everything looked serene and protected from an occasional burst of machine gun bullets passing
                    harmlessly overhead, also shells were going overhead and landing a hundred feet or so from the
                    headquarters. It looked good to get a bit of sleep, propped up against the switch board. No luck
                    however. In about an hour word came to me that a line was out, back to battalion headquarters just
                    where I had come from in the cave. So getting myself together I started back to the headquarters
                    board, but soon found that I was following a different line, that made quite a different circuit
                    back, a practice frequently practiced when it was a heavily loaded line, and subject to being
                    knocked out frequently. By this time it was very dark and there seemed to be quite a bit of
                    activity, shells and machine gun fire, and progress slow, and contact with
                    "doughboys" apparently moving toward the front, taking a lot of time, identifying
                    and trying not to get shot by some trigger happy, nervous guy who would shoot and ask questions
                    afterwards. I walked and crawled along for what seemed <list type="footnotes">

               </figure> an interminable time, laying down when star shells came over to lighten up the sky. The
                    Germans seemed to be very interested in that particular part of the front. I don't know
                    what was going on but I had a suspicion that a regiment or division was being moved into the line
                    and "Fritz" was nervous. I was too. After crawling along for some time with the
                    telephone line in my hand I came to a body, and my wire ran under it so I had to feel around it to
                    locate my wire on the other side; then move on for a few feet and run against another, move on; star
                    shells and the place lighted up light as day, and inevitably followed by a burst of machine gun fire
                    and a shell or two coming over. They were all two or three feet high, they did you no harm except
                    make you nervous and slow you way down. It was slow business. Finally I got back to the cave and had
                    a clear board after clearing the break. I was sure glad to get back, since it was beginning to show
                    light in the east. I had been most of the night, was dog tired and plenty dirty. The next morning
                    after having a couple of hours rest I went out to investigate the area I had been over the night
                    before, and counted over 200 dead on the little field I had crawled across the night before.</p>
            <p>In front of the cave entrance a road ran. It seemed to be quite an important road from the amount of
                    traffic it carried. In front of the <pb n="56" id="VAA4025-097-1-062"/> cave entrance and off to one
                    side was dug a small trench about 18 inches wide and 15 feet long. In one end of the trench a post
                    was set in the ground and on top of this post was mounted a German machine gun in such a way as to
                    command the road and particularly, any airplanes that might be strafing the traffic. The Germans
                    must have left in a hurry, because the gun, upon examination, seemed to be in operating condition,
                    even with a belt of ammunition in it. After looking it over and pulling back the cocking lever,
                    pointing it toward the sky, I pulled the trigger and fired three shots before I could get my finger
                    off the trigger.</p>
            <p>There was considerable traffic on the road and it wasn't long before a German plane came
                    along strafing the road from about 150 feet up. Whether anyone was seriously hurt I will never know.
                    However, I jumped down in the trench and grabbed the machine and pointed it down the road. Sure
                    enough in a very short time another plane came along strafing. I got the machine gun pointed in his
                    general direction and pulled the trigger and sent a good burst in his general direction. Nothing
                    happened so I must have missed. Later on, one of the German triplane fighters made a run. I was so
                    intent on looking at it, I forgot to shoot. Practically all the ammunition was gone anyhow. That was
                    the only triplane I ever saw. They were so little I don't know how they managed to fly.
                    They must not have been too successful for that is the only one I ever saw.</p>
            <p>Out of Soissons the Germans must have made a rather determined stand for we were around there a few
                    days. However I never got to sleep in the cave again. The next I was in the cave it was about all
                    cleaned out, but there had been plenty of activity around where I had been, mostly further and
                    further away from the cave.</p>
            <p>One night two or three days later there were three of us wandering around looking for a place to
                    spend the night, when another company lineman came along and gave us a piece of advice. He said that
                    just ahead of us about 50 yards was a narrow gauge railroad and maybe there might be a shed or
                    building near it. We went looking and there sure enough along a narrow gauge railroad was a rather
                    well built log cabin type structure, and the railroad ran up to the only door. No one around, we
                    went inside. There was no one in it and it was clean, and covering over half the floor space were
                    boxes, about two feet square. We decided at once that it would be a wonderful place to put up for
                    the night. There was one little draw back, when you closed the door there was no light. One of the
                    fellows searched through his belongings and came up with a piece of candle. We lit it and set it on
                    one of the boxes, closed the door and bedded down for the night—dry, quiet and a good
                    sleep. Next morning awakened sometime about sunrise, lit our candle, and proceeded to get ready for
                    the day. We were almost ready when the door flew open and a French soldier looked in, took one look,
                    stepped back, said "oiei" and took off on a dead run down the narrow gauge track.
                    I took one look at him and <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-097-1-063"/> said something tells me we better get
                    the hell out of here. The whole French army will be on us very soon. We got out fast. Down the road
                    about a quarter mile we found a kitchen, and had breakfast. With a little discrete questioning we
                    learned that we had wandered over the line between the French and Americans, and the narrow gauge
                    railroad was put there by the Germans to haul ammunition to the Big Bertha—a big cannon
                    put in to shell <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and had actually sent a few shells, but they had quickly dismantled it when they began
                    to retreat and the French and Americans had advanced too quickly. The log hut was an ammunition dump
                    for the guns. They had moved out so fast they had not even got it all moved before they had to
                    leave. Our bed had been powder for the Big Bertha. I am glad none of it had been spilled around on
                    the floor of the log hut or it could have gotten quite warm. That stuff burned rapidly we found out
                    later when we lit a stick and watched it run along the ground.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

            <p>After leaving Soissons, the war seemed to kind of speed up, never a dull moment and the lines seemed
                    to be always out about the next morning.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> I was put on an out line and took
                    over the line not going in any good determined direction at all. It seemed to rather be following a
                    road, and it soon became apparent this road had artillery on it, horse drawn 75's, and that
                    they were getting tangled up in my telephone wires in a way they shouldn't, and there was a
                    lot of it. The horses were floundering around and falling over and getting telephone wire under
                    their shoes and around their legs, it was no good trying to clean this mess up in the dark. About
                    two thirty or three o'clock I gave up and sat down by a tree and fell off asleep. When I
                    awoke it was just getting light and the horses and guns were still milling around, the guns more or
                    less pointed in one direction which was over my head. Before long one battery after another went off
                    just over my head. I was partially behind a tree from them, which helped some, but it knocked me out
                    for a while. I finally got my bearings and got up to the road. Here the French were industriously
                    cutting my telephone wires into six inch pieces trying to get it off from <list type="footnotes">

                    as a telephone system. I went back to company headquarters and explained why the telephone was out,
                    and apt to stay out for some time. I took another line out in a different direction.</p>
            <p>The fighting seemed to be picking up and movement accelerated. The Allies were on the move and all in
                    one direction, which was good. It was becoming quite evident that business at the front was picking
                    up. Days would go by when I would not spend more than a few hours without all my switch boards in
                    various headquarters changing location and I was busy. Would no sooner get one line in and back to
                    headquarters, wherever that might be, when another was out, day and night. One day, or I should say,
                    one night about two in the morning I started out with a line in my hand. We were quite close to the
                    front, for every 5 or 10 minutes a German machine gun let loose and I ducked. It was easy to tell
                    the difference between German guns and ours. When I say ours, I mean French. We had no American
                    machine guns. I never saw an American machine gun on the front until the very last days. I walked a
                    mile to see it—a Browning. The Germans guns had a heavier sound than the French
                    "sho-sho's" we used.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Well, the wire I was following
                    took me to a road, and turned and followed this road. Bad practice—too much traffic. In a
                    short distance I came to an American truck stuck along side the road. Being stuck wasn't
                    hard to get in a truck equipped with hard tires. It could be done in a puddle of mud no larger than
                    a campaign hat.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Anyway this driver must have gotten himself lost, he had no
                    business being that close to the front with a truck. He apparently found that out, he
                    wasn't around any more. An evil thought came over me. It was misting rain, there was a
                    chill in the air, I was wet, and oh so tired, and the phone wire was repaired. The truck with a
                    canvas top on it looked so dry and besides the truck bed was made of steel with steel sides. That
                    would stop machine gun bullets at that distance if any happened to hit. So I weakened and
                    investigated the inside of the truck. It wasn't empty. There were two men in it, one making
                    groaning noises, the other still—too still. The one groaning <list type="footnotes">

                            of the war numbered 29,000 rifles and 27,000 heavies. Pershing forbade their use until near
                            the end of the war, for fear the Germans would capture and copy them. The Brownings were the

                    water and sweetened vin rouge—awful stuff, but wet. He said he had been hit in the belly
                    a couple of hours ago by a machine gun and he was cold—could I wrap his blanket about
                    him. The other man also wanted a drink and he was also hit by a machine gun, but in the lung to the
                    right and above his heart. He was also cold and shivering, and wanted his blanket.</p>
            <p>It was dark inside, wet and cold outside. I lay down to get a little rest and sleep with my blanket
                    around me, soon was gone. I must have slept for two or three hours, for when I next opened my eyes
                    it was light but still rainy and misty. As I came to, I became aware of my surroundings. I reached
                    out and touched the hand of the man next to me. It was cold and stiff, but he was not feeling it. I
                    looked over at the other man, he was laying very still, not shivering any more. Dead men
                    don't shiver.</p>
            <p>I got out of the truck, picked up a wire at the edge of the road, bit into it, found it alive at both
                    ends. One [i.e., headquarters] reported it was just about to move, and would be out in a few
                    minutes, making new connections. So I followed the wire in the opposite direction and soon came to a
                    headquarters of a company, also expecting to move within an hour. I reported the two dead men in the
                    truck, and asked about a kitchen. It was down that way the last they knew, so off I went looking for
                    oatmeal and coffee.</p>

                            by far the largest battle during American participation in World War I. The AEF lost 26,000
                            men killed, the most costly battle in the nation's military history. One million
                            men took part in the field armies, First and Second, directed by Pershing, who was army
                            group commander. Nine divisions opened the battle in the I, V, and III corps, distributed
                            left to right on a front extending from the Argonne Forest in the west to the
                                <geogName>Meuse River</geogName> near Verdun. The Thirty-second Division at first was in
                            reserve for V Corps, whose divisions, left to right, were the Seventy-ninth, Thirty-seventh,
                            and Ninety-first. On September 30 the Thirty-second relieved the Thirty-seventh, and on the
                            night of October 3-4 it relieved the Ninety-first. Fighting took place in the neighborhood
                            of Romagne, the present-day location of a cemetery containing 14,000 graves. The division
                            captured Romagne on October 14, was relieved October 20, and reentered the line as part of

            <p>The captain asked me if I knew where company I was, or if I could find it, and I said I thought I
                    could if it was still on the end of a telephone wire where it had been about an hour ago. The switch
                    board man said he thought it was because he had talked with I only a few minutes ago. Then the
                    captain told me to deliver Lt. So-and-so there at once. I said "Yes, Sir," it was
                    all I could say. I went over to the switch board, asked the operator which was I Company circuit,
                    picked up the wire and said to the Lieutenant "This way," and he said
                    "Sir" in a way to let me know I was to say "Sir" whenever I
                    addressed him. After having proceeded a short time a German shell came over and landed a short
                    distance away. I heard it come and automatically made a slight duck, as you invariably did when
                    shells came over. It landed a safe distance away and the lieutenant said "Why did you
                    duck?" and I said "just from habit, some explode closer, and within range of their
                    shrapnel." The lieutenant asked how I knew it was shrapnel, and I said most of the shells
                    sent over by the Germans on this front at this time were shrapnel because it was more or less open
                    fighting and they were interested in killing infantrymen or wounding them. He then asked how I knew
                    it was a German 77 and shrapnel, and I said, by sound, and didn't elaborate further. I
                    could have said you will learn fast enough, if you live long enough, but then if I had said all of
                    that I would have had to end with a "Sir" and I had about run out of
                    "Sirs" for this guy. We soon arrived at I Company and turned the lieutenant over
                    to the buck private on the board who told the lieutenant that the "Cap" would
                    probably be in in a few minutes if he made it at all. He didn't finish with a
                    "Sir" and the lieutenant didn't say a word. He was catching on it might
                    be better to have these fellows for friends, with so many bullets flying around.</p>
            <p>The war carried on for a few days and once again I was on a trip to I Company only a little farther
                    toward the front, once the front had moved a quarter of a mile or more toward <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The "buck" on the board asked if I knew where battalion headquarters
                    were and I said yes. He said there was a man here the Captain wanted to go back now. He was not
                    wounded, but had the worst case of shell shock, jitters, nerves he had seen in a long time; he sure
                    was out of it. In a few minutes the Captain came in with the lieutenant, who was the muddiest, most
                    bedraggled individual I had ever seen; hollow eyed, stooped, gun gone, and shaking like a leaf in
                    the fall breeze. It certainly was the same man I had brought in a few days before, but the strut and
                    cockiness were all gone and when I said to him "follow me" there was no
                    "Sir." This man had learned about war in a few short days.</p>

                    sitting with his back to a tree, humped over with his head forward on his chest, down in his blouse.
                    One of the fellows with me remarked that maybe the man was hurt, and went over and spoke to him.
                    Getting no reply he nudged him with his foot, and the man's head simply fell off over to
                    the side. He had been hit by a shell sliver that had practically decapitated him and he had been
                    killed instantly. How he had got into that sitting position against the tree I will never know, but
                    all his blood was down inside his blouse. He never heard the shell that got him. There was nothing
                    we could do, so we went on to company headquarters. It struck me a bit, I must confess.</p>
            <p>About this time it seemed to me there was a sort of lull in the fighting. I guess we were not pushing
                    so hard, anyway, everything seemed to stand still, the kitchen where I had eaten once or twice
                    stayed put, and I was hanging around for a day or two. The Germans ran up an observation balloon
                    across the small valley from where we were located. Then I was sure the observer who was in it
                    spotted the kitchen at once, and lobbed two or three shells over at us to let us know he knew we
                    were there. The French air force sent fighter planes over one at a time to make a try at shooting
                    the balloon down, usually <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-097-1-069"/> coming in high and diving down at the
                    balloon. They did not have any success. Of course the balloon was ringed with German machine guns,
                    and they did manage to get one of the French fighters, but they never did shoot the balloon. The
                    Germans did eventually pull the balloon down, but they were a bit late as the ground troops
                    eventually took the sites. Later I was at the balloon site, after it was burned, and saw the truck
                    which was used as its ground base. The truck had a large winch filled with cable which was used to
                    raise and lower the balloon. The truck engine was tied up so as to drive the winches.</p>
            <p>It was at this headquarters that I got my first hit with shrapnel. About noon each day the Germans
                    always lobbed three shells over at the kitchen. They seemed not to have the range worked out very
                    well for they always missed by about 100 to 200 feet. The shells always lit over in a little ravine.
                    You could depend on the Germans doing better than this. About the third day they did. A shell came
                    over awfully close to the mark. It was so close there was not enough noise to have any time to duck,
                    but I was trying. Just as I ducked a piece of shrapnel about the size of your hand hit me flat on
                    the hind end. Just like being kicked by a mule with new shoes on. I was protected by my blouse,
                    pants, a roll of telephone wire; never the less it knocked me flat on my face, and I had the sorest
                    fanny for a week you ever saw—black and blue. It is a good thing that shrapnel did not
                    hit edgewise or it would easily have relieved me of half my fanny. It made me more wary of shells. I
                    ducked lower, faster and with more protection if it were available.</p>
            <p>Time passed and in the end I got able to walk again without wincing with every step.</p>
            <p>It must have been getting along the first of October, anyway, along about this time for some reason,
                    the powers that were decided that we needed a rest.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> I do not know what brought
                    that on, it had never happened before, as far as I could remember. They must have run out of enemy.
                    We were even loaded into trucks and hauled five or ten miles in some direction, unloaded in a small
                    town that had civilians in it, and not badly shot up. We were advised not to light a light after
                    dark as the Germans patrolled the area with planes at night. It would not have taken very long to
                    find that out on our own. The little town had a road, which looked as it might be of some
                    importance, and a small river running along side. In short time we were billeted in a barn close to
                    the river, and were advised it would be a good time to take a bath in the river and wash our
                    clothes, just as if this wouldn't occur to us. The army never gave a buck private the
                    credit for having enough sense to get in out of the rain, until there was a dirty job to do. Then he
                    was told, go do it.</p>

            <p>The next morning I rounded up a bucket, filled it with water from the creek, and had a fire going.
                    Shed my underwear and cooties, my socks and shirt, and had them merrily boiling away in the bucket
                    with a small piece of soap, always available to a buck who had been around for a while. By noon the
                    washing was done and hung out to dry. The day had warmed up to be quite pleasant and we decided it
                    was time to go swimming and get rid of the cooties and cootie eggs that might be hiding away in the
                    folds of our skin. We went down to the stream, which seemed to be quite low, and filled with rocks
                    of all sizes, with a pool of water deeper than elsewhere in the rippling stream. Ideal bath tub,
                    although a bit exposed and chilly in the breeze. I planned to make it as fast as possible, so I
                    stripped off, laid my clothes on a rock on the shore, and proceeded to take a bath, with about fifty
                    other bucks in the immediate vicinity. It wasn't long before I was chilly, ducked into the
                    small pool on the down stream side of my rock and was ready to leave, when I looked up and on the
                    bank was what must have been the entire female population of the village on the bank, located all
                    about the rock where my towel and clothes were piled, laughing and jabbering, enjoying the best show
                    that had been in town for their lifetime. I stood around in my pool of water shivering, getting
                    colder by the minute, hoping they would go away, <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-097-1-071"/> which they
                    showed no inclination to do. So finally the fellow next to me said, what the hell, and we stood up
                    and headed slowly toward the bank, picking our way carefully among the rocks. The women and kids
                    were all around my clothes, so it was necessary to literally shove them away to get to my clothes.
                    But we finally made it and got dressed, with plenty of close observation to each detail.</p>
            <p>By the end of our week, we had only been bombed three times and I was very well de-cootied and could
                    sleep all night without scratching. We were herded back into the trucks and back to the line we
                    went. Not much movement had taken place. We were about where we were when we left. The Germans must
                    have taken advantage to get ready to pull back because in the first few days we were back we
                    appeared to be moving again by the changes made in the various headquarters company stations and
                    outpost positions.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I was making a run between two switch boards one day, just after I had spliced a wire and got them
                    to talking again, in a little ravine about halfway between stations, I came across a couple of
                    stretcher bearers with a wounded man. They were both very well pooped, but one of them, a small guy,
                    was really bushed. He said he could go no further, and would I carry his end of the stretcher a
                    short distance to the aid station. I agreed since the man on the stretcher didn't look as
                    if he had too much time left. He had been struck in the shoulder by shrapnel or machine gun [fire]
                    and had lost a lot of blood. We picked up the stretcher and started for the aid station. It was
                    really rough going and hindered by the fact that the right arm of the man we were carrying kept
                    falling off to one side of the stretcher, which started the bleeding again, and he did not have too
                    much left to lose. Finally I took a piece of telephone wire and passed it around the stretcher a
                    couple of times and bound his arm to his side. In that manner we made it to the aid station. I am
                    sorry to say, however, that our passenger did not. I was somewhat late in getting back to the switch
                    board, but then no one noticed, the lines were still in.</p>
            <p>For the next few days we seemed to be making fair progress toward the German lines, but were very
                    busy keeping the lines of telephone communication functioning.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> One night I
                    went on a call on an out line back to battalion headquarters, finally got it in around about four
                    o'clock in the morning, all bushed, decided to get a little sleep if possible. It was a
                    nice warm balmy night for this late in the fall, so I decided to sneak away about a hundred feet and
                    sleep an hour or two in a little field just a short distance from the exchange. I spread my poncho
                    in what had been an old plow furrow at the end of the <list type="footnotes">

                    pillow, and my helmet propped up against my head. I was soon asleep. I do not know how long I had
                    dozed off when there was a roar and I saw all the stars of a constellation and a severe pain in my
                    head and I was out. How long I do not know, but when the shell hit it was dark, and when I began
                    being aware of the world around me again, it was quite light, so I must have been out for at least a
                    couple of hours or more, and I was sick, and had a terrible headache. I lay still for a short time,
                    collecting my thoughts, and getting them together. Finally I began to explore my head to see what
                    damage had been done. My helmet, which had been propped over my head, had taken a beating. It had a
                    large dent in it where a piece of shrapnel had mashed it down far enough to hit my head, and broken
                    a hole in the helmet so that the sharp edge from the break had punctured my skin on my head and
                    dented my skull. However there was little blood on my head, but did it hurt, and when I tried to
                    stand up, it was almost impossible, so I just sat down and stayed there for some time. Finally
                    feeling a bit strange, I got back to the first aid tent at battalion headquarters. They wanted to
                    send me to a hospital, but all my contacts with a hospital had been bad, so they stuck a patch on my
                    head, gave me some aspirin, and a pill for pain, and told me to take it easy for a day or two. That
                    was easy to do for me. In a couple of days I was feeling quite well again, and went back to work,
                    with a very tender head. It gave me something to think about, and more respect for German 77
                    shrapnel.</p>
            <p>After a short time things more or less settled into the old routine. Just one telephone line after
                    another out. No let up. Then one day the news arrived that I had been waiting for the last two
                    months. I got orders to be shipped back to my old place in Headquarters Company back at division
                    headquarters. Just like going home. I was to report back November first. They must have needed a
                    truck driver. I couldn't get away, however, until the top sergeant of the company had his
                    chance to get at least one more days work out of a buck private he was going to lose. He
                    couldn't touch me for a detail so long as I was on the telephone maintenance detail, so I
                    had to peel potatoes again. But I didn't mind, I was going home.</p>
            <p>On November first I went back to Division Headquarters and found Company C of the Signal Corps and
                    checked out and reported to Headquarters Company and to the top sergeant, and was immediately
                    assigned a truck—three ton Packard. Moved in with my old buddies, and had a good
                    night's rest, mostly out of range of cannon fire and away off from machine gun fire. Next
                    day I was sent out in my truck on routine runs, and had a good talk with my old buddy Hank, and got
                    a lot of pointers on what to scrounge up to make my truck (tent) habitable, good solid useful
                    information from an expert. Within a couple of days we were on the move again, this time we were
                    supposed to go to a little town not too far away with the name <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-097-1-074"/>
                    of Dun Sur Meuse. On the way there we passed a sign on the road pointing off to our right, to
                    Verdun. That was the place where there had been a long hard battle before the Germans had finally
                    broken through on their push to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which they had never reached, but had been stopped at Chateau Thierry where we had
                    helped the French stop them, at our first front experience.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Upon arriving in
                    Verdun, we could hardly believe how completely a city could be leveled by bombardment. As far as I
                    could see there was not one single building standing, with big shell craters all over the place and
                    trenches. In one place was the notorious trench of bayonets where, along where the trench had been,
                    it was filled, but bayonets were protruding from the ground in an orderly row. It was said that at
                    the end of the bayonet was a man's body, still in an upright position, still with his gun
                    in his hand where he had died when the trench had been filled in by cannon fire, each man stood his
                    post and died rather than retreat. They were French bayonets.</p>
            <p>After driving around town we took off for Dun, not too far north. We soon found it. A small French
                    village on the Meuse. The town was mostly intact since it was located in the little valley of the
                        <geogName>Meuse River</geogName>. The town had been shielded from the shells because of the
                    rather close, high rise of the valley side just back of the town. Any German shells that cleared the
                    heights just back of the town would also clear the few houses strung along the road, but back closer
                    to the hills, and would land on the road and in the <geogName>Meuse River</geogName> or the fields
                    beyond, so the town had been spared.</p>
            <p>We were assigned to stay in a stone barn that had lost one corner to a stray shell, because it also
                    had a small barnyard for us to park our trucks in.</p>
            <p>We moved in and cleared out a corner of the barn for a place to sleep and built a small fire to warm
                    the place a bit as it was getting chilly after the sun went down. As dark approached we let the fire
                    go down to just a mound of coals and stretched a shelter half over it so as not to be seen from
                    above and keep the heat in. Spent a comfortable night. In a couple of days rumors began to float
                    around the war would be over in a few days. The rumors got more persistent from day to day until a
                    definite date was set. It came and went, but the war was still on.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Then the
                    date was moved forward and got stronger and stronger. We had been fooled once, this time we did not

                    firing would stop at 11:00 o'clock. We took this with skepticism, and went on with our
                    business, which was driving trucks here and there, moving various things and men occasionally. About
                    10:00 o'clock in the morning of the 11th Hank and his truck were sent on a trip down the
                    road. Off he went out of sight, down the road. In about 15 minutes here came a truck down the road
                    wide open, and a shell broke right on it, it appeared to us. In a couple of minutes in came Hank.
                    The whole back end of his truck banged up with what had sure been a near miss of a German shell.
                    Hank said that last one hit right on my tailgate, and those bums up there said the war was over. Had
                    that shell been a couple of seconds sooner it would have hit Hank right on his truck section. It
                    sure would have been tough to get killed within a few minutes of the end of the war.</p>
            <p>Within a few minutes of 11 o'clock it seemed as if every outfit in the army was trying to
                    shoot off every piece of ordinance they had. We hid under our trucks. Then at 11:00 everything was
                    quiet, very quiet. We lay there waiting for it to start again, but it didn't, it was for
                    real.</p>
            <p>That night we had a real fire in the barn and slept warm. Next day was quiet. We just set around or
                    worked on our trucks and speculated on where we would go and how soon we would start home. This went
                    on for a day or two and the rumor started that we were going up to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> in the Army of Occupation.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> In another day this was verified by
                    the fact that we got orders to take our trucks over to the auto dump and get new trucks. We were all
                    elated at the idea of having nice new trucks. Too good to be true. We went over to the dump turned
                    in our trucks and were taken over to a line of old trucks that didn't look as good as the
                    ones we had, and told to pick ourselves out a truck. These old pieces of junk were not nearly as
                    good as the ones we had. I got one which they bragged on a lot, which should have been a warning to
                    me. It was a junker. I barely got it back to our parking lot. The next two days I spent trying to
                    tune up the wreck so it would run. Finally, with a new distributor, new plugs, timing, it ran
                    reasonably well. I also fixed the governor so it did not interfere with the speed, which was
                    strictly against orders, but I could always say that is the way it was when I got it, just be the
                    good old dumb buck.</p>
            <p>The next day orders came to me to be ready to take off early since my truck was to be used for the
                    telephone communications <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">28</hi>For the Army of Occupation, the Third Army, General Pershing chose
                            only divisions that had seen the most action. The men of the AEF always believed that the
                            First Division, the first in <placeName>

                            </placeName>, saw the most action, followed by the Second. Both were regular army divisions.
                            In fact the Thirty-second achieved the same number of battle honors as the First and one
                            more than the Second. So proudly reported a guard officer, Captain Charles S. Coulter.

                    not know[,] did not belong to our battalion, but I was to report to him. The usual army clear,
                    concise orders. If a buck was involved, we were never told anything. As it turned out I did not have
                    to find the lieutenant. He and the sergeant found me in the morning early, asked if I were ready, I
                    said yes "sir," and he said first we have to go get some stuff at headquarters,
                    and we will be off. So off we went to his headquarters, the lieutenant on the seat beside me, the
                    sergeant in the back. The only reason I got to keep my seat was because I had to drive, and I could
                    not do so from the back.</p>
            <p>We were off, going south along the <geogName>Meuse River</geogName> for a few miles. Then turning off
                    to the left to pick up the <geogName>Moselle River</geogName> highway which ran in a general
                    northeast direction. This road was crooked, and up hill and down. Not much time could be made,
                    although it really was not a bad road. We were supposed to get out ahead of the general moving
                    troops, most of who were marching and in horse drawn wagons, slow going. The lieutenant had a map,
                    on which was marked our destination for each day, only about 15 miles per day, and name of small
                    town or wide place in the road where we were to stop and make telephone connections in the local
                    telephone switchboard to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, so the General in charge would talk with headquarters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> upon his arrival. It seems he held back and traveled with the troops so as to arrive
                    with the kitchen. Of course he was not walking.</p>
            <p>I soon found out that it was a good practice to make a call on my old friend the mess sergeant and
                    scrounge food to take along in the truck, just in case. I always managed to keep a supply of bread,
                    C rations, coffee, bacon and jam on hand, which came in handy at times, and made a big hit with the
                    Germans in whose homes we usually stayed.</p>
            <p>We had started out on about the third day after the armistice, and were on the road quite a number of
                    days, going slowly for us, but plenty fast for the men who had to walk. I think we advanced roughly
                    15 miles a day, some days more, some less, easy for me in a truck, but for a man with a full pack,
                    up hill and down, not so easy. I am not real clear on just what day we crossed the <geogName>Rhine
                        River</geogName>, it must have been the 12th or 13th of December.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> We were
                    out in front of the troops a good way when we came to a stretch of a mile or two of straight road,
                    quite good, so I stepped down on the old Packard truck some and made a lot of noise. Pretty soon we
                    could see a big bridge ahead of us and also an MP out in the road frantically warning us to stop. We
                    stopped and the MP wanted to know how we were out so far in front of the main army, and a lot of
                    other questions. I was glad the lieutenant was there, he was in command, I didn't have to
                    say a <list type="footnotes">

                    they decided that we could go ahead, but were not to catch up with the Germans who were a short
                    distance ahead. We drove on to the bridge over the <geogName>Rhine River</geogName>, which was
                    located north of Coblenz about 8 miles according to the map the lieutenant had. As we passed the
                    middle of the bridge we could see the tail end of the German army in a column of four about ready to
                    leave the bridge. We drove to within a couple of hundred feet of the hinnies, and slowed down so as
                    not to get any closer, after clearing the bridge.</p>
            <p>There was a road leading off to the right, so we took it, and landed in a small town on the river
                    bank, very close to the spot the lieutenant was looking for, the telephone exchange. We pulled up
                    and stopped. He got out and we looked around and lo and behold there was a little restaurant right
                    beside the truck, so the sergeant and I decided it would be a good opportunity to try out German
                    cooking, although it didn't look too prosperous. We went in and the operator and two
                    customers, who apparently just finished a late breakfast or mid-morning snack, eyes popped out. We
                    must have been the first American soldiers they had seen and they apparently had not expected us
                    that day. The two customers left at once. We sat down at a table and ordered three eggs, toast and
                    coffee. The operator looked startled, and said kine eis, bread ersatz un nicht haba
                    fleish—coffee ersatz, nicht gute. I said one minute, and went out front to my hoard in
                    the truck, and came back with a half loaf of badly mashed, white bread, also a chunk of bacon and a
                    glass of jelly. I put them on the counter and said toast, and bacon, also three eggs, and the
                    sergeant echoed, three eggs. We gave him our canteens of coffee and told him to make it hot. In no
                    time we had three eggs, fried strips of bacon and white toast, and a glass of jelly, grape as I
                    remember, a good hot breakfast. And the word must have gotten about as people began to walk past the
                    restaurant to see the American soldiers. In about half an hour the lieutenant came back and said
                    "I see you have already had breakfast," and we said "Yes sir."
                    As we came out the lieutenant said we had to go to Coblenz and look up where the bridge-head command
                    office was to be, so off to Coblenz we went and crossed back to the city which is on the west bank,
                    on a pontoon bridge. There was also another permanent bridge here. How it happened to be spared I
                    will never know.</p>
            <p>We found the headquarters and after a time the lieutenant came back and said as soon as we unloaded
                    his material, I could report back to my outfit, which was not far away in Coblenz at present. I took
                    off and soon found them all wondering where I had been.</p>
            <p>We were in the city only a few days till we all moved back across the river to a little town where we
                    took up residence in a private house with a barnyard, in which we could park our trucks. This house
                    was fairly large having four rooms in a row on the first floor and four above them. On the first
                    floor a living room in front, then the dining <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-097-1-078"/> room, then the
                    kitchen and bedroom. The household consisted of a mother and father and two teen aged daughters.
                    There were two of us lodged in the back bedroom on the second floor. The only way we could get there
                    was to go through the daughter's bedroom. It was quite apparent that mamma was quite
                    apprehensive. She needn't have been because there were some very strict orders out
                    concerning our conduct and fraternization.</p>
            <p>The company kitchen was about a block away, and my old friend "sarge" was there. We
                    understood from the first that we would not be located here long. During the time we spent in this
                    house along came Christmas and would you believe it we had turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, green
                    peas, gravy, the whole Christmas dinner. How the army managed that will always be a mystery to me.
                    The German family we were living with could simply not believe it. We brought in heaping mess plates
                    of everything including big cups and canteens of real coffee which the Germans had not seen for a
                    year or two. We divided up and you should have seen them dig into that dinner.</p>
            <p>Within a day or two after Christmas the word began to circulate that we would be moving again and
                    sure enough in a few days we got the word. This was not to be a long move, actually not more than
                    ten miles further away from Coblenz, but closer to the perimeter of the occupation. Didn't
                    mean much, we left one morning and were in and established by mid-afternoon. From my view it was a
                    total loss, we ended up being billeted in what had been some kind of school for the feeble minded,
                    at least that was what had been moved in. Our room was what had been a gymnasium, with twelve or
                    fifteen of us sleeping on army cots. Quite a come down from the feather beds we had been sleeping on
                    the last few days, and no women to make them up. There was naturally a lot of squawking. One
                    advantage was, however, all our equipment was in the same building, with our trucks parked in the
                    street on a slight hill, along side the building, which was to cause trouble later.</p>
            <p>Things settled down into a routine within a week. I had a daily run with a big Fiat auto which had a
                    body built on the back in which I hauled batteries to the various radio stations located throughout
                    the area which our division occupied.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> This took about three or four hours a
                    day, and the rest of the time was used up by special missions, or sleeping, hauling stuff here and
                    there, sleeping and reading. One drawback being there was always someone in the room, talking,
                    playing cards, smoking, etc. At least not conducive to sleeping.</p>
            <p>I got fed up with this condition before long, and began to figure out how to get a private room in a
                    private home, and was informed that it was possible, if I could find one within a block or so, and I
                        <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>

                    on duty.</p>
            <p>I started looking, and came up with a room in a house about two blocks away and closer to the kitchen
                    than we were now, where my old friend mess sergeant was in charge. The place I found was not a big
                    place, but typical of the houses in the neighborhood. It was situated on a curving street, and sat
                    directly on the street, no yard. The house had two stories in front, two rooms on the first floor
                    and two above. On the back side of the house had been built a sort of T addition one and one half
                    stories in height, about. In the T part on the back down stairs was a dining room, kitchen
                    arrangement, and a stairway going up to the room above, which actually had side walls about four
                    feet high and a gable roof. A stairway led from the kitchen-dining room below. There was no
                    plumbing, although there was a pump in the kitchen sink.</p>
            <p>Also attached to the kitchen was the cow barn. By opening a door to the kitchen you could get a close
                    view of a cow facing the other way; convenient for milking. Where would you put her calf?</p>
            <p>Also in the back and attached to the house were the chicken coops stacked on top of each other and
                    containing about a dozen hens, also the Chick Sales and a barn or shed containing hay and feed for
                    the cow.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> There was a regulation by the government that all eggs laid by the
                    hens went to the government for use in the hospitals, and were collected each week.</p>
            <p>Light for the house was provided by one drop from the center of each room. I got permission from the
                    sergeant of the Headquarters Company to move out of the gymnasium and offered to put a phone in the
                    sergeants room and headquarters room so he could get ahold of me whenever he needed me. This was the
                    thing that did the business. Before it was all over, we had a regular telephone exchange for the
                    favored few. It took a lot of patching up of old phones to get this system working. Finally
                    everything got worked out. My room had a good bed, with feather comforters above and below. The only
                    trouble being they were too short and had to be laid catty-cornered across the bed to cover me from
                    my chin to my feet. I figured most Germans must be short or they liked to double up in bed. After my
                    room had been fixed up to my liking, it had a comfortable warm bed, a stand along the wall on which
                    were placed an old time bedroom pitcher and wash bowl, along with water at all times, and a mirror
                    for shaving. Along side my bed was a small table on which the local family had placed an electric
                    lamp, after I had run a wire from the ceiling outlet. Where that lamp came from I will never know.</p>

            <p>After about two or three weeks, the high brass became concerned about how us poor privates were being
                    housed, so the lieutenants were requested to make a visual inspection of our quarters, and report
                    any irregularities which they came across. The chore fell to the lieutenant in charge of the
                    Headquarters Company. Of course no buck private was told of this inspection, the object being to
                    keep the privates as ignorant as possible about what was going on or what was about to take place.</p>
            <p>Well, I was inspected, all out of a clear sky about eight o'clock one morning, my lieutenant
                    burst in upon the people with whom I was living and demanded to see my room. They did not know what
                    to do, except show him the room. He came up and caught me half dressed and shaving and it was well
                    past 8:00 and any buck private was expected to be down to the orderly room and to have had his
                    breakfast of oatmeal and coffee, and be ready for the days assignment. And here I was in my
                    underwear, just shaving, and sitting on the end of the bed was the tray on which my breakfast had
                    been served, and it was only too obvious that breakfast had consisted of two eggs, white toast, jam
                    and coffee served in a china cup, and bacon, two big pieces. The lieutenant took one look and said
                    "Who the Hell do you know"? Well, he knew who I knew, he also knew that I knew
                    there would be just the routine report on my quarters, everything OK. Word came down the next day
                    the lieutenant would like to have a telephone in his room if one could be found. One could be found.
                    I had a better room than he did, more light and more service.</p>
            <p>After our inspection, which by the way, was the only one I ever had in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, things settled down to more or less a daily routine. I made my daily routine
                    delivering batteries and had lots of loafing on my hands, and since I had a regular delivery run and
                    was on detail I could not theoretically be on two details at the same time, so could not draw KP or
                    guard duty or other details that are always looking around for some poor buck to do them. So I had
                    time to get in a little more trouble. The small courtyard at the school where the company was housed
                    had become a repository for cars and trucks that were not running so well, or not at all. Among this
                    assortment of immobile vehicles was a Harley Davidson motorcycle that was among the casualties.
                    Several guys had had a turn at trying to get it to run, no success, so one day I tried my hand.
                    First had to find out why it wouldn't run. It didn't take long to learn there was
                    no spark getting to the spark plugs. Upon examining the distributor it was obvious the points were
                    not opening and on further inspection the spring to the points were broken, and the points would not
                    open, therefore no spark. After scrounging around for a short time I found a small piece of flat
                    steel that looked as if it may have been out of an old corset or something of the kind. After
                    considerable time and effort, bending and cutting and working on it, it would fit behind the broken
                    copper spring in the distributor so it would open when it should and <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-097-1-081"/> distribute a spark to the cylinders at the right time, and to my utter
                    astonishment, the engine ran after a fashion.</p>
            <p>Well, there was nothing to do but to immediately test it out, no matter the chain was so loose it was
                    practically falling off. I got the cycle on the street, the engine started and off we went. The
                    further we went the better it ran for a mile or two, and we were out in the country in no time, on a
                    very narrow hard top road. The farmers in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> never miss a bet. The road was just wide enough so that by being careful a couple of
                    vehicles could pass. The farmer had plowed and seeded the normal sides of the road right up to the
                    hard top and the telephone poles sat back in the farmer's field about 8 or 10 feet on
                    either side of the hard top. This area was cultivated and well fertilized with the contents of the
                    honey wagon.</p>
            <p>After having gone down the road a couple of miles, I slowed down and turned around and as I slowed
                    the engine began to miss and jump. Anyway, starting back toward home base the engine ran very
                    roughly, missing and bucking. As I gained speed I just aggravated the condition. Finally with a
                    great jerk the drive chain jumped off the sprocket, got mixed up in the rear wheel, off the road we
                    went headed directly toward a telephone pole, which we fortunately missed by about an inch. The
                    cycle fell over. I dived over the handle bars, plowing a nice furrow in the soft, freshly plowed,
                    well fertilized field with my forehead and nose, losing some skin in the process, and collecting
                    some fresh fertilizer, especially too near the road. I lay still for a few minutes taking careful
                    inventory of all my moveable possessions, and decided nothing was missing or broke or lost, and that
                    everything was in working condition. I got up and shoved the motorcycle out to the road, in hopes
                    some one I knew with a truck would come along. I was in luck. Sure enough one of my outfit stopped
                    and asked if he could help. I said yes, help me get this thing in the truck and back home, so we
                    loaded the cycle in the back end. The driver said "DO you look awful! Are you
                    hurt?" and I replied that I guessed not. He climbed in the truck and I walked around to the
                    other side and climbed in, and he said "You stink like Hell. Don't touch
                    anything." We got back to headquarters and drove into the back end of the yard, where we
                    unloaded the cycle and stored it, or rather leaned it against the wall. As far as I know it is still
                    there, but I will bet no one is riding it.</p>
            <p>I needed cleaning badly and it took the rest of the day and all of the next day to get reasonably
                    clean and patched up where I had lost skin from my nose and forehead. I laid off motor cycles for
                    life.</p>

            <p>Postscript</p>
            <p>This is the end of the narrative written by Kenneth Baker. He wrote with pencil on a yellow paper
                    tablet while sitting in the easy chair of his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> retirement apartment. The memoirs were started in August of 1984, 66 years after he had
                    crawled under machine gun fire and ducked shrapnel while mending telephone wires on the battlefields
                    of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>. Kenneth Baker was then 88 years old.</p>
            <p>He had no diary, no bundle of cherished letters kept by his family, no friends with whom he could
                    reminisce nor questioners to quicken his memory. His only reference was his copy of <hi rend="i">32nd Division in the World War</hi> issued by the joint War History Commissions of <placeName>

            <p>The narrative was finished. When I visited my parents in their apartment, I recall reading it to its
                    conclusion with his description of coming home. Unfortunately I did not take the manuscript with me
                    then, and when I did take it for typing the last pages were missing. And Kenneth Baker had grown too
                    tired to write again.</p>

            <p>Most students of American Indian history have heard of Cahokia, the Mississippian city near
                    present-day <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the largest metropolitan center north of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> in pre-Columbian times, which was home to at least twenty thousand and possibly as many
                    as forty thousand Native Americans circa A.D. 1150. The core of the site contains Monk's
                    Mound, rising over one hundred feet and occupying a base of fifteen acres, making it the third
                    largest single monumental public structure in the western hemisphere (after the Great Temple at
                    Cholula and the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacán). Built across a period of two hundred
                    years from A.D. 950 to A.D. 1150, the mound served as ceremonial platform, burial ground, and
                    residence for the ancient Cahokians. First described by whites in 1813 in explorer Henry
                    Brackenridge's letter to Thomas Jefferson, the central plaza at Cahokia had not been used
                    since the fourteenth century by Indians and was then occupied by Trappist monks, whose gardens
                    flourished on the terraces of the earth mounds. After several changes in ownership and use, as well
                    as decades of relic-seeking by amateurs, portions of the site became a State of <placeName>

                    </placeName> archaeological preserve in 1925 and was designated a United Nations World Heritage Site
                    in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>From the 1950s through the 1990s, Cahokia was intensively investigated by teams of archaeologists
                    seeking to explain the mystery of the rise and decline or dispersion of Mississippian civilization.
                    This book recasts the history of archaeological research at the mound city through the recollections
                    of Melvin L. Fowler, professor emeritus at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, who first climbed Monk's Mound in 1951 and who spent a career interpreting
                    its meaning. The book is cowritten by Bioloine Whiting Young, who prompted Fowler to use his wealth
                    of knowledge about the site and his personal acquaintance with two generations of field
                    archaeologists who have worked there to summarize what is known, what is conjectured, and what
                    remains a mystery about the ancient city.</p>
            <p>The team-writing works well to serve general readers and scholars alike. We learn of the big
                    discoveries, areas of broad consensus, and areas of sharp disagreement in the many-layered evolution
                    of archaeology at Cahokia. The book updates Fowler's earlier edited works, <hi rend="i">Explorations into Cahokia Archaeology</hi> (<placeName>

                    controversies and cites dozens of articles, monographs, and edited works that <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-097-1-084"/> cumulatively have made Cahokian studies a subfield within North
                    American prehistory. Beyond this contribution, Fowler uses the book as a personal forum for
                    characterization of fellow scholars whose trowels, spades, and backhoes have unearthed
                    Cahokia's many mounds and features, at times at cross-purposes with his own agenda. While
                    this sometimes distracts the reader from the main story, this second level of historiographical
                    discussion will be of interest to anyone deeply attentive to the history of archaeology in the <placeName>

            <p>Blue Jacket, or Waweyapiersenwaw, was a Shawnee warrior and diplomat who lived in the <geogName>Ohio
                        River Valley</geogName> from the 1740s to the first decade of the nineteenth century. By 1772 he
                    had emerged as a chief among the Shawnees of the <geogName>Scioto River</geogName> because of his
                    abilities as a war leader and his understanding of whites. He opposed white settlement of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> after the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768), and he probably fought in the Battle of Point
                    Pleasant in 1774. Despite his resistance to European encroachment upon Indian lands, he learned
                    English, adopted European ways of living, and married a white woman. He was allied with the British
                    during the Revolutionary War, fighting well in the campaign against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1778-1779. He may also have taken part in Captain Henry Bird's foray into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1780. He was outraged by American encroachments on Indian territory north of the
                        <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> after 1786. Withdrawing with his people to the <geogName>Maumee
                        River Valley</geogName>, he and they allied with the Miamis. He also became an ardent supporter
                    of the Mohawk Joseph Brandt in his efforts to form an Indian confederacy against the Americans.</p>
            <p>After the Treaty of Fort Harmar (17891, which he held in contempt, Blue Jacket assumed leadership of
                    the tribal confederacy and helped inflict stunning defeats upon two <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> armies, one led by Joseph Harmar in 1790 and the other by Arthur St. Clair a year
                    later. He then helped conduct fruitless peace negotiations with American representatives until the
                    summer of 1793. He led an unsuccessful assault on Fort Recovery in June 1794 and on August 20 was
                    soundly defeated by General Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. In 1795, he represented a number of tribes in
                    negotiations <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-097-1-085"/> that led to the Treaty of Greenville, which ceded

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Living as a ward of the American government until his death in 1808, he remained a
                    spokesman for the Shawnees and supported efforts by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa to restore Indian
                    civilization to its prewhite integrity.</p>
            <p>John Sugden has written an important book in the field of Indian history. He has used an impressive
                    array of sources, both primary and secondary, to round out the story of Blue Jacket's life.
                    Filling in many gaps in the biographical narrative, he also provides a good survey of a wide swath
                    of Indian history, always from the perspective of the native people. He therefore sees the
                    encroachments of whites on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> country as an invasion and, without becoming preachy or strident, tells a balanced
                    story of how two civilizations came into conflict. He is an excellent writer, and his narrative
                    moves along at a brisk pace. He is also an excellent historian, and he provides on most occasions
                    just the right amount of background information to keep his audience engaged. With this biography,
                    Sugden establishes Blue Jacket as one of the most important Indian warriors in American history,
                    along with Pontiac, Tecumseh, Cochise, Geronimo, Crazy Horse, and Sitting Bull.</p>

                    </placeName> political history, the connection between the first and second party systems. Rather
                    than viewing the 1820s as a period of "political limbo" (p. xi) between the party
                    of Thomas Jefferson and that of Andrew Jackson, Ratcliffe argues for continuity between the two.</p>
            <p>For Ratcliffe, the second party system's democratic, antielitist politics merely built upon
                    the earlier base. He believes the first party system was far more egalitarian than is generally
                    assumed. At the same time, he contends that events between 1818 and 1822 were critical in forming
                    the political loyalties of Ohioans. That period witnessed the Panic of 1819, the cut-throat policies
                    of the national bank in the wake of economic downturn, and the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Compromise crisis. These events forged sectional politics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Western interests in internal improvements and northern distaste for slavery should

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s loyalty to the Adams-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> ticket. How, then, to explain the triumph of Jackson in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, with his ambiva- <pb n="80" id="VAA4025-097-1-086"/> lence toward the economic
                    development so crucial to the West and his southern ties? Ratcliffe discusses a variety of factors
                    historians have considered in explaining the emergence of Jackson: the surge of new voters in the
                    1820s, ethnocultural issues, the market revolution, Jackson's charisma, and party
                    organization. He gives each of those factors its due as, for example, in the case of German and
                    Scots-Irish voters, for whom ethnocultural loyalties were important. He ultimately concludes that
                    the alignments of the first party system determined voting patterns. Although the focus is on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Ratcliffe, of course, argues that Ohio exemplifies changes occurring in the rest of
                    the country. But Ratcliffe emphasizes local contexts to such an extent, that one wonders whether <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, even though an important state, was representative.</p>
            <p>Ratcliffe has provided an exhaustive and sophisticated discussion of the links between the two party
                    systems and the understudied period of the 1820s. Because much of the argument about the nature of
                    the first party system is contained in another book (<hi rend="i">Party Spirit in a Frontier
                        Republic</hi> [1998]), readers may find that part of the argument underdeveloped in this book.
                    The chief difficulty in the current book is in distinguishing between those political patterns
                    determined by the first party system and those created by the transitional period of 1818-1822. If
                    the period of economic panic and sectional animosity is so important in forming Ohioans'
                    political loyalties, how can the loyalties of the first party system be said to be still in force?
                    Nonetheless Ratcliffe has written an interesting and provocative work that historians of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and national politics in this period will find useful.</p>

                    voluminous that simply listing their bibliographical details would fill several volumes"
                    (p. viii). Rather, Harrison is interested in one aspect of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> that has emerged in our collective construction of history, memory, and myth over time:
                    "the interrelationship between <placeName>

                    </placeName> and his native state had profound consequences during the Civil War, since his
                    understanding of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

            <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-097-1-087"/>
            <p>Perhaps for this reason the author devotes more than half the book (chapters 7 through 13) to the
                    years between 1850 and 1865, with particular attention to the secession crisis, the presidential
                    election of 1860, the state's neutrality, military operations in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, wartime politics, and the issue of slavery. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> had the disadvantage in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> of running for the presidency as a Republican and finished dead last in a four man
                    race, receiving only a few more than a thousand votes in his native state. Despite this inauspicious
                    beginning, the new president understood that most Kentuckians were staunch Unionists who would rally
                    against any effort to hold a secession convention. And despite the difficulties of prosecuting the
                    war in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, most notably the violation of civil liberties, widespread opposition to the draft,
                    bitter denunciation of the Emancipation Proclamation, outcries against the enlistment of black
                    troops, and insensitive and overbearing military governors, all of which alienated many
                    conservatives, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s administration managed to keep the state in the Union. His understanding of
                    Kentuckians and his longtime ties to insiders like Joshua Fry Speed and his wife's family
                    helped him gauge the pulse of the commonwealth's people during the war years.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest to students of Indiana history is Harrison's chapter on
                    "Kentuckians in Indiana." The author provides a highly readable overview of the
                    Thomas Lincoln household's part in the larger folk migration of the Upper South's
                    yeomanry into the southern part of Indiana. Thomas Lincoln, Abe's father, chose a spot in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Perry County</region>
                    </placeName> and moved his family there in 1816 when Abe was seven. In many respects this migration
                    recreated the frontier conditions that the household had begun to escape in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, including the hardships of clearing land, raising a cabin, and making a farm. The loss
                    of Abe's mother, Nancy <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to illness and the loneliness that followed was lessened to some extent by the arrival
                    of more Kentuckians in the community and by Thomas Lincoln's marriage in 1819 to another
                    and more prosperous Kentuckian, Hardin County widow Sarah Bush Johnston. As Harrison observes,
                    however, it was during this period that "an estrangement" between Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his father developed, one that would last for the remainder of Thomas
                    Lincoln's life.</p>
            <p>In his preface, Harrison states his intention to focus on the topic of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s relationship with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> "without straying off onto interesting bypaths" (p. viii). This
                    reviewer, however, wishes the author had explored further the relationship between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own regional identity and the distinctive natural region of his birth called
                    the Knobs. That Lincoln was "of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>" there is no doubt, at least to the extent that he was born and reared there
                    until he was almost eight years old. The larger question is, which <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>? Like the South as a whole, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> is the sum of many parts, each with its own natural and cultural features, and the
                    Knobs was one of those <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-097-1-088"/> regions. Formed by a series of
                    well-defined hills surrounding the Bluegrass region, it was a yeoman farmer and low slaveholding
                    area where plain folk struggled for self-sufficiency. Thomas Lincoln was one of those plain folk.
                    From the Knobs, he and his neighbors looked eastward into the wealthy Bluegrass world, one
                    privileged by the largest concentration of slaves in the commonwealth, but the settlers in the Knobs
                    were outsiders looking in. The migration of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s family northward across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> into southern
                    Indiana recreated a community that was in many respects (crops, families, institutions) <placeName>

                    </placeName> all over again with one major exception: slavery was no longer a factor in the
                    accumulation of wealth and determining family status in his new state. The development of Abe <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own regional consciousness and how this in turn shaped an intellectual
                    foundation for his later free-labor and free-soil Republican ideology is worth additional

                    </placeName> Municipal College are all tales well told. The authors have also assembled a collection
                    of over two hundred illustrations of people and places in the university's past. It is
                    difficult not to laugh at the candid news photo of a bored administrator at a campus convocation and
                    easy to admire the clever use of yearbook illustrations as a substitute for texts on campus life.
                    The authors clearly have an affection for their campus, but they do not ignore topics that an
                    institutionally sponsored project might be tempted to avoid. The chapter assessing the merits of the
                    school's claim to the 1798 founding date <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-097-1-089"/> of an earlier
                    local academy is gracious but firm in its skeptical judgment. The sections on race relations remind
                    us how slowly institutions of higher education opened their doors to African Americans in the past
                    century.</p>
            <p>The authors show that the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> has a surprisingly complicated history. It did not begin as a liberal arts, a land
                    grant, or a teachers' college; it did not receive meaningful state support until the 1970s.
                    Instead, it traces itself to several earlier academies and professional schools; it has absorbed
                    other financially troubled schools; it has occupied multiple campuses in different parts of the
                    city; and at times in this century it has "often tried to be all things to all
                    people" (p. 206). The authors faced the daunting task of reviewing, on average, a year of
                    institutional history for each page. They did so by concentrating on the changing mission
                    statements, administrations, and community ties of the university. We learn much of multiple local
                    needs, including both a desire to provide professional training, especially in medicine, and
                    municipal concerns heavily steeped in boosterism. We also learn much of the strong sense of autonomy
                    that has long permeated the university's diverse constituent parts. If there are faults
                    here, they are primarily those of selection. The law school, with poor records, is documented less
                    well than the medical school. Student life, especially among the large commuter populations, is
                    sparsely treated. The changing curriculum invites more inquiry. A full page devoted to modern
                    cheerleaders and mascots seems excessive. But on balance the authors have succeeded in capturing the
                    excitement and diversity of an important regional university.</p>

            <p>This volume honors historian Eugene D. Genovese with nine essays (eight previously unpublished)
                    written by colleagues and students. Genovese, of course, has been one of the leading historians of
                    the American South and slavery for three decades, and for many of us who developed an interest in
                    southern history in the 1970s his was the most consistently innovative, informed, and provocative
                    voice in the field.</p>
            <p>These essays explore areas of scholarship in which Genovese worked long and fruitfully, as well as
                    areas where he spent less time. Most well known among his books is <hi rend="i">Roll, <placeName>
                            <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                        </placeName>, Roll: The World The Slaves Made</hi> (1974) and several of the essays take their
                    cue from <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-097-1-090"/> this work. David Brion Davis leads off with a typically
                    incisive look at the way masters in different times and places have seen slaves both as beasts of
                    burden and fellow human beings; Davis thus explores links between slavery and humanitarian thought.
                    Robert L. Paquette takes up a figure of enduring interest to Genovese—the African
                    American slave "driver" or foreman—and suggestively explores the way in
                    which students of southern literature and history have tended to use the driver to represent the
                    complexities of bondage. An intriguing look at the "task" system of slave labor is
                    undertaken by Peter A. Coclanis, who applies insights from microeconomic theory of
                    "agency" to posit reasons why economically rational planters would adopt a form of
                    slave labor organization based on "self-regulation and free time." Among other
                    things, Coclanis finds that many masters learned farming techniques from their slaves through the
                    task system. Rounding out these essays are two on Old South intellectuals. Clyde N. Wilson explores
                    the economic thought of John C. Calhoun in order to examine its "republican"
                    features. Douglas Ambrose's essay is an illuminating discussion of the robust statist
                    thought of intellectuals Henry Hughes and the Reverend James Henley Thornwell, undercutting the
                    facile notion that a strong central state had no place in the thinking of defenders of slavery.</p>
            <p>Other essays in the collection take on subjects less examined in Genovese's work, including
                    women and gender, which he has nodded to but never much explored. Thavolia Glymph gives a scathing
                    reading of planter-class diarist Mary Chesnut, revealing how Chesnut's view of African
                    American women grew much more racist in her postwar retrospections, and Drew Gilpin Faust gives a
                    sensitive and critical reading of another planter-class woman, Catherine Edmondston, to show what
                    "unreconstructed means, as we watch how a woman's experience of the Civil
                    War's social disruption hardened after the war into a self-serving social logic. Two final
                    works explore ties between fiction and southern society, also not an area well-worked by Genovese,
                    who, nonetheless, has always relished a good quotation from authors of fiction. Mark G. Malvasi
                    offers a dark but persuasive reading of Allen Tate's 1938 novel <hi rend="i">The
                    Fathers</hi>, and Louis A. Ferleger and Richard H. Steckel discover that William Faulkner was not
                    correct in portraying southerners as stunted physically.</p>
            <p>The volume concludes with a brief, friendly interview of Eugene Genovese by the
                    editors—actually what seems to be fragments from several conversations "from
                    July 1995 to December 1998." There also is a useful bibliography of Genovese's
                    "principal writings," ranging from works that in themselves are a canon of
                    historiography to obscure book reviews written in the 1950s under the pseudonym Vittorio della
                    Chiesa, who, though otherwise unacknowledged in this volume, probably has interesting stories to
                    tell.</p>

            <p>Peter Cozzens has written a series of useful and highly regarded accounts of important battles in the
                    western campaigns of the American Civil War. Works on Iuka and Corinth, <geogName>Stone
                    River</geogName>, Chickamauga and Chattanooga flowed from his pen within roughly a decade. <hi rend="i">General John Pope</hi>, a biography of a Union field commander, is his first foray into
                    a full-length life study. However, this book is best understood as an account of the
                    general's most important battle sandwiched by his early life and his remaining career. As
                    such, it is Cozzens's first study of the campaigns fought in the East, and it is a
                    distinguished entree into the crowded library of Civil War literature.</p>
            <p>John Pope was born in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, in 1822 and reared in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> by a politician father and well-educated mother. After his well-connected father got
                    him appointed to West Point, Pope left home at sixteen (Cozzens dispatches his youth in five pages)
                    and embarked on a long career in the U.S. Army. After graduation Pope served without much honor or
                    distinction, earning a reputation as a lying, bragging, and insubordinate junior officer while he
                    was doing engineering work for the army. War in 1861 brought new opportunities offered by fellow
                    Illinoisan Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an old friend of his father's. He soon was promoted to general and assigned
                    to command troops in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>. He made his reputation with his aggressive Island Number 10 campaign on the
                        <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName> in the spring of 1862, and President Lincoln began to
                    view him as a candidate to replace General George B. McClellan in the East. In June, Pope was
                    offered command of an independent army in an attempt by Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M.
                    Stanton to supplant McClellan, who was too popular in the Army of the Potomac to be replaced
                    outright but too timorous to retain in overall command.</p>
            <p>In the core of the book (125 pages), Cozzens delves into the politics of command in the East and the
                    sources of Pope's ultimate disaster in the months following his appointment. Rancor,
                    quarreling, and backbiting among commanders served to destroy any commonality of purpose or
                    planning. Cozzens rightly places much of the blame on General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, whose
                    faults are displayed frequently. But in the author's minute account of the campaign, Pope
                    comes in for a good deal of blame as well. Pope's ultimate defeat at Second Bull Run in
                    late August 1862 owed much to his rejection of intelligence that contradicted his wishful thinking.
                    His subsequent lifelong battle of words with his subordinate Fitz John Porter stands as testimony to
                    his inability to see his own failings in the battle.</p>
            <p>Pope was exiled to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1862 to put down an Indian uprising, and here begins the period of the
                    general's greatest usefulness to the country. Pope's subsequent career was in the
                    West, and Cozzens rightly gives attention to his significant service there. <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-097-1-092"/> Pope's "genuine interest in [the Indians']
                    welfare" (p. 259) made him an effective leader, and his voice in policymaking on Indian
                    affairs was influential in the Grant, Hayes, and Garfield/Arthur administrations. Retiring from the
                    army in 1886 as a major general, Pope wrote his Civil War memoirs (published serially). He died in
                    1892.</p>
            <p>Cozzens has written a serviceable biography of an important but usually maligned general, but more
                    importantly he has crafted a fine study of the Union high command in the Battle of Second Bull Run.
                    This book will stand for years as an important study of leadership, or lack thereof, in battle.</p>

                    </placeName> Court House. To be sure, the surrender of Lee's army on April 9 was decisive
                    in the demise of the Confederacy, but the war stuttered on briefly elsewhere, most notably in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, where Joseph E. Johnston surrendered what was left of the Confederate army to William
                    T. Sherman on April 26, seventeen days after <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Appomattox</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mark L. Bradley's excellent new book is the story of this "end
                    game"; it details both the final military moves of the field commanders (Sherman and
                    Johnston) in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> and the political environment that circumscribed their efforts to make a final end to
                    the war in the parlor of the Bennett House. That surrender might have commanded even more historical
                    attention had Johnston and Sherman been successful in their efforts to conclude the war with a
                    sweeping agreement that would have allowed existing state governments to remain in place. But their
                    effort failed, undone largely by the emotional response to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s assassination and the new political environment that followed in its wake.</p>
            <p>Bradley is the author of the definitive account of the Battle of Bentonville, the last major field
                    engagement of the war, which took place in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> in late March. In some ways, this book is a sequel to that account since it picks up
                    the narrative after Bentonville and follows the movements of the opposing armies during the ensuing
                    month. It is more than a military history, however, for Bradley also illuminates the
                    perhaps-inevitable political scrambling that accompanied the collapse of the Confederacy. He
                    describes, for example, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> Governor Zebulon Vance's tentative efforts to make a separate peace with
                    Sherman; he explores the question of why Sherman failed yet again to finish off Johnston's
                    crippled and outnumbered army at Bentonville; he considers the motivations of the <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-097-1-093"/> Federal cavalry commander, Judson Kilpatrick, who attempted to sabotage
                    the peace discussions in the hope of inflicting a final devastation on the beaten enemy.</p>
            <p>On the whole, Sherman and Johnston emerge as the heroes of this history. Each man, Bradley argues,
                    had a clear vision of what was necessary (and what was possible); both men sought to bring the war
                    to an end with civility; and both believed that their efforts were hindered, and finally undone, by
                    their political masters, Jefferson Davis for the Confederacy and Edwin M. Stanton for the Union.
                    Sherman was furious with Stanton and refused to speak to him after the secretary of war publicly
                    accused Sherman of disloyalty because of the agreement he made with Johnston.</p>
            <p>If Sherman and Johnston are the heroes, the villains of this tale (besides the politicians) are the
                    cavalry commanders on both sides. Joe Wheeler, Bradley charges, was simply "unequal to the
                    responsibilities of high command" (p. 224), and the opposing cavalry chiefs, Wade Hampton
                    and Kilpatrick, remained so focused on their own destructive agendas that they had to be physically
                    separated as they waited outside the house where the peace negotiations were taking place.</p>
            <p>Bradley's benign assessment of Joe Johnston is likely to attract particular attention.
