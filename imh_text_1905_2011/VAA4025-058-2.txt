            Was the Nomination of Wendell Willkie a Political Miracle?

            Biographers have concurred in the judgment of contemporary politicians and pundits that the 1940
                    Republican presidential nomination went to the colorful political amateur from Indiana as the result
                    of a "Miracle in 
                        Philadelphia
                    ."1 Willkie had not won any pledged delegates in the
                    presidential preferential primaries or in the Republican state conventions held in the spring of
                    1940. One friendly biographer wrote that less than two weeks before the Republicans assembled in 
                        Philadelphia
                     Willkie "did not possess the pledge of a single state delegation."2 And the New Republic in its convention post-mortem
                    explaining "How They Won with Willkie," asserted that when Willkie arrived in 
                        Philadelphia
                     "his delegate strength could have been mustered in a medium-sized hotel
                        room."3 But insufficient investigation has been made of the interim
                    period between the naming of the last delegate during the final week of May and the opening of the
                    Republican national convention on June 24, 1940. There is

                     considerable evidence which suggests that during these first
                    three weeks in June, Willkie gathered enough reliable promises of delegate votes to make him one of
                    the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination before the first roll call of the
                    states. The Willkie weapon of victory was fashioned in the weeks immediately preceding the
                    convention balloting as fragments of many delegations coalesced to form the wave which crested at 
                        Philadelphia
                    . Where did the Willkie votes come from and why did they go to Willkie?
            The two leading Republican presidential contenders in the spring of 1940 were Senator Robert A. Taft,
                    of 
                        Ohio
                    , and Thomas E. Dewey, district attorney of 
                        New York County
                    . Taft had served in the Senate for less than two years. Dewey, narrowly defeated for
                    the governorship of 
                        New York
                     in 1938, had never held an elective office on the state or national level. That these
                    two comparative newcomers to politics were the pick of the candidate crop was testimony to the
                    severity of the shrinking pains suffered by the Republican party during the 1930's.
            Dewey and Taft had conducted sharply contrasting campaigns. From January, when Dewey issued his first
                    campaign statement on foreign policy, until June, when he delivered a convention-eve radio address
                    over a national network, the dynamic New Yorker had been on the prowl across the land. Taft, on the
                    other hand, had been a weekend warrior, pleading that he could not in good conscience desert his
                    desk while the Senate was in session. Dewey had swept through five spring primaries without a
                    check.∗ Taft relied for his convention strength on a network of understandings he had
                    reached with professional politicians scattered throughout the South and Middle West.5
            
            Under the unwritten rules governing Republican presidential campaigning, which appeared in 1940 to
                    have been drawn for a noncontact sport, Dewey and Taft had not met head-on in a single primary.
                    Dewey had defeated Senator Arthur Vandenberg, of 
                        Michigan
                    , decisively in the 
                        Wisconsin

                     5 By 1940 the heyday of the presidential preferential primary was
                            over. Less than half of the one thousand Republican delegates were chosen by the primary
                            method.

                        Nebraska
                     primaries, but the New Yorker's name had appeared alone on the ballot in
                            
                  Illinois, Maryland
               , and 
                        New Jersey
                    . Taft, for his part, had entered only the primary in 
                        Ohio
                    , where he was unopposed. Republican voters had not had an opportunity to choose between
                    Dewey and Taft in a presidential preference primary. As a consequence, each of the front runners had
                    in his train a number of camp followers whose loyalty, at best, was only first-ballot deep.6 Dewey, the acknowledged leader in pledged delegates, was particularly
                    vulnerable to raids because few of his followers were attached to his cause by strong bonds of
                    either personal or political loyalty. And far more than any specific candidate, the minority
                    Republicans were desperately searching for one who could bring the party back to the White House
                    after an absence of eight years.
            If the world had been at peace, the probability is that either Dewey or Taft would have been the 1940
                    Republican presidential candidate. But events in Europe in the spring of 1940 influenced the course
                    of domestic politics in the 
                        United States
                    . When 
                        France
                     fell and 
                        England
                     tottered, the inexperience of Dewey and the isolationism of Taft persuaded many voters
                    to cast about for a new candidate. Dewey was the principal loser. The Gallup Poll of April 23, 1940,
                    recorded the high water mark of Dewey's popularity. As the Nazi tanks streamed across 
                        France
                    , and 
                        England
                     lay under the shadow of invasion, Dewey's popularity steadily waned.7 This state of affairs was tailor-made for the appearance of the forceful
                    Wendell Willkie, who was more experienced as an executive than Dewey and more international-minded
                    than Taft.
            The first leakage in Dewey's pledged delegate strength began, however, in his own 
                        New York
                     delegation several weeks before the European crisis and the emergence of Wendell
                    Willkie as a serious presidential contender. It sprang 
                  
                     6 Of the 448 delegates chosen by the primary method, only the
                            twenty-four Dewey delegates from 
                                Wisconsin
                             and the fifty-two Taft delegates from 
                                Ohio
                             voted as a unit for more than one ballot. Official Report of the

                     7 Dewey's popularity with Republican voters declined from his
                            being favored by C7 per cent (April 23) to 29 per cent (June 25). Willkie rose from 3 per
                            cent (April 23) to 44 per cent (June 25). Dur- ing the spring of 1940, Taft's
                            popularity ranged from a high of 16 per cent (May 16) to a low of 8 per cent (June 11).

                     from a feud between Dewey and Kenneth F. Simpson, Republican
                    national committeeman from 
                        New York
                    . Dewey had broken publicly with Simpson, his original political mentor, after hard
                    feelings developed during Dewey's unsuccessful run for the 
                        New York
                     governorship in 1938.8 Dewey decided to drive Simpson from power in
                    the Republican state organization and replace him with one of his own lieutenants.9 In April, 1940, emboldened by unexpectedly easy victories in the 
                  Wisconsin, Illinois
               , and 
                        Nebraska
                     primaries, the Dewey forces moved to consolidate their position in control of the 
                        New York State
                     Republican Committee.10
            
            If Willkie had not rocketed into national political prominence in May, Dewey's determination
                    to force a showdown with Simpson might have tightened his hold over the 
                        New York
                     delegation. But when the Dewey high command finally ousted Simpson as national
                    committeeman a scant two weeks before the Republican national convention assembled, Willkie was in
                    the field as an announced presidential candidate actively gathering delegates.11
                    Moreover, Simpson still exercised a decisive influence over some twenty delegates from 
                        New York
                     City from his secure command post as Republican chairman of 
                        New York County
                     (Manhattan). Simpson prepared to lead his loyal followers into the Willkie camp on an
                    early ballot, after first honoring a prior commitment to vote for Frank Gannett, publisher of a
                    string of upstate 
                        New York
                     newspapers, on the first ballot.12
            
            The harsh treatment meted out to Simpson further sapped Dewey's 
                        New York
                     strength because it alienated the Gannett delegates from the Mohawk
                    Valley. In contrast to the bareknuckle assault on Simpson, the Dewey managers had handled
                    the ephemeral presidential candidacy of Frank Gannett with kid gloves. Dewey had sought to avoid a
                    two-front war in his home state by allotting Gannett several votes from the 
                        New York
                     delegation in the expectation that the publisher would release them after one or two
                        ballots.13 The Dewey

                     organization, therefore, was shocked on the first day of the
                    national convention when Mayor Holland B. Marvin, of 
                        Syracuse
                    , the leader of the Gannett bloc, announced his "sincere belief that Wendell L.
                    Willkie is best equipped to be the Republican standard bearer in these critical times."14 With the Simpson dissidents from Manhattan on the loose and the Gannett
                    delegates from upstate moving to join the stop-Dewey front, the 
                        New York County
                     District Attorney had lost control of one-third of the 
                        New York
                     delegation before the balloting began.15 Dewey was in deep trouble
                    in his own state.
            Willkie was also the beneficiary of an intraparty split in 
                        New Jersey
                    . Through no fault of his own, Dewey suffered a serious setback in the gubernatorial
                    primary between former Governor Harold Hoffman and State Senator Robert Hendrickson. The latter
                    piled up his winning margin over Hoffman in 
                        Essex County
                    , where the political organization supporting Hendrickson was also strong for Dewey. So
                    bitter were many of Hoffman's followers over his defeat that they were eager to retaliate
                    against Hendrickson by opposing Dewey's bid for the presidency.16
            
            In the 
                        New Jersey
                     presidential preference primary, Dewey rolled up 340,000 votes, while Willkie received
                    some 25,000 votes as a write-in candidate.17 But the national convention
                    delegates were not under a legal obligation to vote for the primary winner.18
                    While the entire 
                        New Jersey
                     delegation was nominally pledged to Dewey, a number of them were openly hostile to the
                    candidacy of the New Yorker, and others were lukewarm in their support. Several of the delegates
                    elected on the Dewey ticket promptly announced that they did not regard themselves as bound to vote
                    for the primary winner even on the first ballot. At the initial meeting of the 
                        New Jersey
                     delegation, observers estimated that one-third of its members intended to vote for
                        Willkie.19

                     to bolt to Willkie mounted during the month between the primary
                    and the national convention. The Dewey leaders in 
                        New Jersey
                     were so uncertain of their support that they neither polled the delegation nor sought
                    at any time to invoke the unit rule for fear the defection might become epidemic.20 As the Republicans began to arrive in 
                        Philadelphia
                    , Lloyd B. Marsh, of Passaic, who had backed Hoffman in the gubernatorial primary,
                    proclaimed his willingness to serve as a Willkie floor leader. This declaration of open warfare
                    between the Hendrickson and Hoffman factions raised to twelve the number of firm Willkie first
                    ballot votes from 
                        New Jersey
                    .21
            
            Willkie, however, did not rely entirely upon the windfall of votes which he had not had to work for.
                    On the weekend preceding the 
                        New Jersey
                     primary, he had attended a reception in his honor at 
                        Somerville
                    .22 Willkie followed up this brief foray in mid-June with his first
                    direct personal canvass for delegates on a whirlwind tour through 
                        Maine
                    , 
                        New Hampshire
                    , 
                        Vermont
                    , 
                        Massachusetts
                    , 
                        Rhode Island
                    , and 
                        Connecticut
                    .23
            
            
               
                        New England
                     was promising territory for a Willkie safari, because it was a land of favorite sons
                    who had rebuffed both Dewey and Taft. In the initial presidential preference primary of 1940, 
                        New Hampshire
                     Republicans had approved a slate pledged to Senator Styles Bridges as a favorite
                        son.24
                    
                        Maine
                     followed suit in April, selecting a delegation leaning toward Bridges.25 A weak bid by Dewey supporters was turned back in 
                        Massachusetts
                    , where a delegation expected to plump for Representative Joseph Martin was chosen.26 In 
                        Rhode Island
                    , an incipient Dewey movement led by an avowed opponent of the state administration was
                    soundly trounced in the Republican state convention by the organization of Governor William
                        Vanderbilt.27 The Republican state convention in 
                        Connecticut
                     similarly ignored pressure from

                     the national candidates and swung in behind Governor Raymond
                        Baldwin.28 Tiny Vermont also named a group unpledged to any of the national

            Willkie's preconvention peregrination into 
                        New England
                     yielded an encouraging number of reliable offers of delegate support. Speaking from the
                    same platform, Governor William Vanderbilt, of 
                        Rhode Island
                    , announced his personal endorsement of Willkie's candidacy, thus assuring the
                    Hoosier a foothold in that delegation.30 Senator Styles Bridges, of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , listened sympathetically to the case for Willkie and promised to deliver his bundle of
                    favorite-son votes to the Hoosier on an early ballot.31 Governor Raymond
                    Baldwin, of 
                        Connecticut
                    , was so favorably impressed that he agreed to lead his favorite-son delegation to
                    Willkie on the second ballot.32
            
            Willkie astutely focused his fire on 
                        Massachusetts
                    , the lodestar of the 
                        New England
                     galaxy. Not only did the Bay State control thirty-four votes, the largest single bloc
                    of votes in the region, but also she influenced political thinking in the smaller adjacent states.
                    Representative Joseph Martin, soon to preside over the Republican national convention as its
                    permanent chairman, had a lien on the 
                        Massachusetts
                     vote as a favorite son. But Willkie chalked up a signal personal triumph by persuading
                    a number of influential politicians in the state that he was the candidate capable of leading the
                    Republicans back to national political ascendancy in 1940. Such powerful 
                        Massachusetts
                     politicians as Governor Leverett Saltonstall, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Christian
                    Herter, speaker of the lower house of the general court, and National Committeeman Sinclair Weeks
                    were reported in Willkie's corner.33

                        them. If left free of instructions, the New Hampshire delegates would probably have split

                        Herald, June 24-27, 1940, contains a detailed analysis of the growth of
                        Willkie sentiment in the 
                            Massachusetts
                         delegation.
            
            
            So impressed was Sinclair Weeks with Willkie that, shortly before the national convention, he
                    undertook a difficult mission to 
                        Washington
                     in which he sought to persuade Representative Martin to resign as permanent chairman of
                    the national convention, release the 
                        Massachusetts
                     delegation from its pledge to him, and nominate Wendell Willkie himself. Martin
                        refused.34 Willkie's meteoric rise, however, had cost Martin the
                    convention loyalty of his own delegation. Despite direct orders from the House Republican minority
                    leader to stand firm, the majority of the 
                        Massachusetts
                     delegation had decided to switch to Willkie after casting a complimentary ballot for
                    Martin on one or two roll calls. On convention eve a close observer of 
                        Massachusetts
                     politics accurately estimated that at least twenty-five of the state's
                    thirty-four delegates were anxious to slip the leash and answer the call of Willkie. He predicted
                    that by the fourth ballot "those among the 34 delegates who will not be counted for
                    him" could be counted "on the fingers of one hand."35
            
            With the addition of the votes from 
                        Massachusetts
                    , Willkie had assurances of approximately two-thirds of the eighty-eight votes from 
                        New England
                     by the third ballot. But the energetic Indianan received additional accessions of
                    voting strength from the East during the period just prior to the balloting. On the first day of the

                        Pennsylvania
                     caucused and announced plans to switch from Governor Arthur James to Willkie on an
                    early ballot.36 Farther south, in 
                        Maryland
                    , former Governor Harry Nice, the "boss" of the delegation, revealed
                    that Dewey could not count on unanimous support beyond the first ballot despite his unopposed
                    victory in the primary. An informal poll of the 
                        Maryland
                     delegates disclosed that a majority had decided to leave Dewey for Willkie.37

                    votes to the Willkie total.39
            
            As the above survey indicates, a viable bloc of Willkie delegates took shape during the month
                    preceding the convention in an area composed of twelve eastern states.40 Willkie
                    sentiment in the industrial East and 
                        New England
                     was more genuine and spontaneous than in other portions of the nation. If a sectional
                    fuse had not been lit and carefully tended, there would probably have been no national explosion for
                    Willkie. The Willkie movement, however, became national in scope as the shock waves spread west from
                    the impact area. Although the nutrients present in the political soil of the Middle West provided
                    more natural nourishment for the isolationism of Senator Taft than the internationalism of Willkie,
                    the latter's managers began to harvest a crop of convention votes during the days
                    immediately preceding the balloting. By the time the convention assembled, Willkie had infiltrated
                    several of the delegations from the Middle West previously shared by Dewey and Taft or held in the
                    name of a favorite son.
            
               
                        Missouri
                     was typical of the uncommitted middle western delegations. Skeptical Republicans there
                    regarded Taft as lusterless and Dewey as an upstart. Because neither of the two leading candidates
                    possessed broad appeal to political groups in 
                        Missouri
                    , no serious attempt had been made to obtain an instructed delegation at the state
                    convention. When the Willkie men made their move late in the spring, the field was open to them. The
                    Willkie prenomination drive in 
                        Missouri
                     was directed by Edgar M. Queeny, president of the Monsanto Chemical Company of 
                        St. Louis
                    , a prototype of the businessman who entered politics actively for the first time as an
                    enthusiastic Willkie booster. Since his previous contact with the political process had been limited
                    to a campaign contribution in the diastrous Landon campaign, Queeny wisely enlisted the aid of a
                    number of rising young professionals who were eager to challenge Old Guard domination of the regular
                    Republican organization. Queeny and his allies proselytized so energetically that when the

                     gathered in 
                        Philadelphia
                    , an estimated twenty of 
                        Missouri
                    's thirty votes were earmarked for Willkie.41
            
            Elsewhere in the Middle West, Willkie's lieutenants were able to establish preconvention
                    beachheads in the pivotal states of Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , and 
                        New Hampshire
                    . Support from Indiana was considered vital to Willkie's success because of the
                    American political shibboleth that a national candidate must have the confidence of his home state.
                    But Willkie's prospects in Indiana were apparently less bright than in 
                        New England
                     and in such eastern states as 
                        New York
                     and 
                        New Jersey
                    . The Indiana delegation to the 1940 Republican national convention contained a number
                    of veteran politicians, including former Republican National Chairman Will Hays, former Senator
                    James E. Watson, former Governor James P. Goodrich, labor leader William L. Hutcheson, and Homer
                    Capehart, a successful businessman who would go to the Senate several years later. As a political
                    reporter close to the delegation put it, these men were "not likely to be influenced by the
                    fact that Willkie was born in Indiana, attended I.[ndiana] U.[niversity] and has strong ties in the
                    state." "If a considerable number of them decide to vote for Willkie it will be
                    because they believe he is the man of the hour."42
            
            Not only were a majority of the Indiana delegation not yet decided to vote for their state's
                    native son but some of them were openly hostile. Former Senator James E. Watson, for example, was
                    said to have compared Willkie to a reformed prostitute who wanted to lead the choir immediately
                    after joining the church.43 Two Indiana congressmen, Forest Harness and George
                    W. Gillie, were among those active in the stop-Willkie movement, which culminated in a meeting
                    attended by more than forty members of Congress.44 There were even two Indiana
                    votes pledged to Senator Styles Bridges, of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , as reward for support of Raymond E. Willis in his unsuccessful 1938 race against
                    Democratic Senator Frederick Van Nuys. On the other hand, Willkie could count on the support of
                    National Committeeman William G. Irwin and Representative Charles A. Halleck. Before the

            Neighboring 
                        Illinois
                     was nominally for Dewey as the unopposed winner of the state's presidential
                    preference primary. But a motion to bind the 
                        Illinois
                     delegation to the New Yorker was tabled at a caucus. Despite the urgings of the

                        Illinois
                     remained thin and unemotional.46
                    
                        New Hampshire
                     moved hesitatingly out of the ranks of the uncommitted when Governor Harold Stassen,
                    ambitious and anxious to back a winner, agreed to serve as Willkie's floor leader after he
                    had completed his keynoting assignment. Stassen's decision to back Willkie was important. 
                        New Hampshire
                     had been regarded as a stronghold of midwestern isolationists to whom the
                    internationalist Wendell Willkie was anathema.47

                        Illinois

                        New Hampshire
                     delegations before the balloting began were of special regional political significance.
                    With the exceptions of 
                        Wisconsin
                     and 
                        Michigan
                    , which were pledged to Dewey and Senator Arthur Vandenberg respectively, Republican
                    delegations from the Middle West in the preconvention period had been either openly for Taft or
                    ready to go to him after fulfilling their commitments to favorite sons.

                     would vote for Hanford MacNider on the first ballot.48
                    
                        Kansas
                     was nominally committed to her senior senator, Arthur Capper, although the key figure
                    in the delegation was former Governor Alfred M. Landon.49 South Dakota would pay
                    her respects to her Governor Harlan Bushfield before shifting to one of the national contenders.50 Until the unexpected emergence of Willkie, the Taft managers had been content
                    to wait, secure in the belief that these votes would gravitate of their own accord to the 
                        Ohio
                     Senator. But by the time the Republican convention opened, the Taft leaders could not

                    renege on its presumably firm commitment to Dewey.51
                    
                        Nebraska
                     was already debating what course to follow after a first ballot vote for Dewey.52 All over the Middle West, delegates were either moving toward Willkie or
                    having serious doubts about the wisdom of acrrying out their original intention of voting for Taft.
                    The Willkie votes from 
                  Missouri, Illinois

                        New Hampshire
                     appeared as portents of even worse to come for the once confident Taftites from the
                    Middle West.
            In comparison with the Middle West, the concentric circles radiating out from Willkie's
                    centers of strength in the East lost much of their force when they reached the Rocky Mountains and
                    the Pacific Coast. Even in these none too friendly areas, however, Willkie had firm assurances of

                     delegation received an urgent message from Governor Charles Sprague pleading for
                    Willkie support on a later ballot on the grounds that Dewey was "altogether too
                    unseasoned" and Taft was "too colorless."56 The big 
                        California

                     of Wendell Willkie had shaken old political alignments in the
                    Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast area and offered an attractive alternative for those delegates who
                    had been unenthusiastic about both Dewey and Taft.
            The pocket delegations of the South proved to be least susceptible to temptation. The Willkie drive
                    made little impression on the states of the deep South. Only in three states of the Upper
                            South—
                  North Carolina, Tennessee
               , and 
                        Virginia
                    —were there any Willkie converts in the immediate preconvention period.58 Taft and Dewey continued to lead Willkie by wide margins south of the
                    Mason-Dixon line as the time for balloting arrived. Southern Republicans may have been more attached
                    to the basic philosophy of traditional Republicanism than their northern brethren. Certainly the
                    southern delegations were more tightly controlled by the organization leaders, and individual
                    southern delegates were less able to vote their personal convictions than were their colleagues from
                    other sections.
            The salient fact which emerges, however, from the above review is that Wendell Willkie had passed
                    well beyond the dark horse stage when the formal balloting began and, in terms of convention votes,
                    was one of the serious contenders for the Republican presidential nomination. More than many of its
                    predecessors, the Republican national convention of 1940 was truly a nominating body in the sense
                    that its choice was not predetermined.
            There was no controlling force operating on the uncommitted delegations to give them direction and
                    purpose before the rise of Willkie to national political prominence during late May and early June
                    of 1940. If the uncommitted delegations had been confronted with the choice of voting for Dewey or
                    Taft, after the favorite sons had dropped out, the selection, in many instances, would have been one
                    of political necessity rather than conscience. The sudden and dramatic appearance of Wendell Willkie
                    as a new attraction in Republican politics did not, therefore, compel most delegates to sever
                    themselves from long cherished and deeply-felt political principles before they voted for him.

            The more closely one examines the balance of political power on the eve of the national convention,
                    the fewer are the surprises in the voting behavior of the delegates during the six roll calls (see
                    Table I) required before Wendell Willkie obtained a clear majority. The distinctive pattern of
                    sectional sentiment which so strikingly manifested itself during the period between the naming of
                    the last of the delegates and the opening of the convention held true to form throughout the
                    balloting and formed the mold of the Willkie victory. For this reason, the direction of the voting
                    can best be charted through a regional analysis.59

            In the twelve-state eastern region, as shown by Table II, Dewey went to the fore on the first
                        ballot.60 His lead, however, was markedly less than his managers had

                     59 For purposes of this analysis, the nation has been divided into
                            four regional groupings of twelve states each. The East has been considered as composed of
                                    
                        Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,

                        Montana, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, California, Washington, Oregon

                        Virginia, North Carolina,
                                    Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
                                    Arkansas, Texas
                     . The 1,000 national convention votes were distributed as
                            follows: East, 322; Middle West, 322; West, 152; South, 191. The remaining thirteen votes
                            were cast by the territories. A simple majority of 501 was required to nominate.
                  
                     60 Voting figures have been compiled from the Official
                                Report of the Proceedings of the Twenty-second Republican National Convention,
                            279–320.
               
                     predicted. Defections from Dewey were apparent from the first
                    ballot onward and his losses, with rare exceptions, were Willkie's gains. By the third roll
                    call, Willkie had moved briskly out in front in the East. On the penultimate fifth ballot, the
                    Hoosier spread-eagled the field in the East, receiving five times as many votes from these twelve
                    states as Dewey and Taft combined. Taft failed to win the nomination because of his disastrous
                    showing in the East, where his maximum share of the vote was 10 per cent on the fifth ballot. On the
                    fifth ballot, by contrast, Willkie had more than 68 per cent of the vote from the East. The
                    inexorable trend toward Willkie in the East can be traced in state after state.

                    , richest in votes with ninety-two, withheld thirty-one votes from Dewey on the first
                    ballot. Of these, only eight went to Willkie. But the Willkie managers knew that the Simpson
                    delegates from 
                        New York
                     City and the Gannett delegates from upstate 
                        New York
                     would come to their candidate on an early ballot. The third ballot became the important
                    turning point for Willkie in 
                        New York
                     when Walter Mack, Jr., challenged the accuracy of the count reported by the chairman. A
                    poll of the delegation brought to light ten more Willkie votes, for a total of twenty-seven. Mack
                    later revealed that the chairman, a Dewey manager, had been reporting the vote of the state
                    arbitrarily without polling the delegates.61 The flow of 
                        New York
                     delegates to Willkie continued on the fourth ballot (thirty-five) and became a
                    hemorrhage on the fifth ballot (seventy-five), when Dewey released his delegates.
            The same pattern was followed in 
                        New Jersey
                    . The disgruntled adherents of former Governor Harold Hoffman, still smarting over their
                    defeat in the gubernatorial primary by the Dewey organization, led the exodus to Willkie which began
                    on the first ballot. They were joined on the third ballot by the chairman of the delegation, who had
                    been the Dewey manager in the state. By the fifth ballot only a handful of Dewey diehards from 
                        Hudson County
                     held out.62
                    
                        New Jersey
                     was in the vanguard of the trend toward Willkie, despite Dewey's triumph in
                    the primary. The inability of Dewey to hold even the delegates pledged to him was a hard blow to his
                    prestige and may have influenced the decisions of a number of uncommitted delegations to turn to
                    Willkie.
            Willkie, for example, fell heir to most of the favorite-son votes from the East. The six 
                        New England
                     states, which had hoarded their votes in favorite-son caches, served as a vital
                    reservoir of Willkie strength by providing nourishing additions to his totals on each of several
                    ballots. Sixteen solid votes from 
                        Connecticut
                     on the first ballot gave Willkie a nucleus for regional expansion. 
                        Massachusetts
                    , in a shift later characterized by Willkie as an "important break"
                    coming at a "psychological moment," abandoned its favorite son, Representative
                    Joseph Martin, after two roll calls.63 New

                        England
                     became a Willkie bastion on the third ballot when the Indianan received sixty-six of
                    the region's eighty-eight votes. Even in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , Willkie made inroads on the favorite-son holdings of Governor Arthur James, who
                    apparently took his presidential candidacy seriously. Despite all of the pressure brought by the
                    leaders of the state organization to hold the delegation on the second ballot.
            In the East, Willkie easily vanquished Dewey, his principal regional rival. But it was Senator Taft
                    who climbed past the fading Dewey to regional leadership in the Middle West. In spite of the
                    noticeable inroads made by Willkie on the 
                        Ohio
                     Senator's estimated preconvention strength, he trailed Taft in the Middle West
                    throughout the balloting. But Taft's comparatively modest advantage over Willkie in the
                    Middle West did not compensate for his crushing deficit in the East.
            
               
                        Ohio
                    's steadfast support for her Junior Senator endowed Taft with a continuing
                    regional advantage over Willkie. Taft was also the principal beneficiary when the Dewey vote from 
                        Illinois
                     began to disintegrate after the first ballot. As the contest narrowed to a choice
                    between Willkie and Taft, North and 
                        South Dakota
                    , 
                  Nebraska, Minnesota
               , and 
                        Iowa
                     gravitated toward the 
                        Ohio
                     Senator. Although outnumbered, the Willkie forces in the Middle West were not swamped,
                    however, as majorities from Indiana and 
                        Missouri
                     joined them on the third ballot. 
                        Missouri
                     had been the most important center of Willkie strength in the preconvention period. But
                    the Indiana delegation moved by bits and pieces toward Willkie as the balloting continued. National
                    Committeeman William G. Irwin and Representative Charles Halleck were joined in the Willkie column
                    by onetime Republican National Chairman Will Hays and Homer Capehart. Even former Senator James E.
                    Watson agreed to let Willkie lead the choir in the Republican church and switched to him on the
                    fifth ballot.64 Then late in the balloting, two middle western states helped
                    Willkie to clinch the nomination. On the fifth ballot, Alfred Landon announced that his 
                        Kansas
                     delegation was now grouped solidly behind Willkie.65 And it was 
                        Michigan
                     which

                     sent Willkie over the top to final victory when the issue was
                    still in doubt halfway through the sixth ballot.66
            
            Further west in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states, however, Willkie lagged behind Taft on
                    all ballots. In fact, Taft was pulling away from Willkie in the West on the fifth ballot, when
                    Willkie was only one roll call away from the nomination. Willkie made little impression on the
                    larger western delegations from 
                        California
                     and 
                        Washington
                    . 
                        California
                     divided her votes among as many as ten candidates; 
                        Washington
                     voted unanimously for Taft on the next to last fifth ballot. The only well-known
                    regional leader to enlist with Willkie was Governor Ralph Carr, of 
                        Colorado
                    , and he brought only a minority of his delegation with him. But Willkie picked up
                    enough scattered votes from 
                  New Mexico,

                    , and 
                        Montana
                     to keep him in the running. On the fifth ballot, Willkie received twenty-six of a
                    possible forty votes from these splinter delegations.
            In the South as well, Taft maintained a substantial lead over Willkie throughout the balloting. When
                    the Dewey vote from the South broke up after the fourth ballot, most of it went to Taft. Only the
                    states of the Upper South made a contribution to the Willkie victory. 
                        Virginia
                    , where genuine Willkie sentiment existed before the convention, provided him with his
                    largest bloc of southern votes with eleven on the fifth ballot. A band of Willkie delegates was
                    formed in the 
                        Tennessee
                     delegation under the leadership of Paul J. Kreusi. This prominent businessman had long
                    been recognized as an influential behind-the-scenes organizer for the 
                        Tennessee
                     GOP, but his responsibilities as head of two Chattanooga manufacturing concerns had
                    limited his political role until his enthusiasm for Willkie drove him to participate more
                        actively.67 More representative of the South as a whole, however, were the
                    delegations from 
                  Texas, Louisiana
               , and 
                        Kentucky
                    , which became a solid Taft phalanx on the fifth ballot.
            The voting pattern in the Middle West, West, and South shows clearly that Willkie did not blitz the
                    1940 Republican national convention. His landslide in the East barely carried him through to a
                    narrow national victory. Until the final ballot, Willkie was a minority candidate west of 
                        Pennsylvania

                        Maryland
                    . The lines of the Taft supporters in the Middle West, West, and South held firm until
                    after Willkie's mass of eastern votes had nudged him across the line to victory on the
                    touch-and-go sixth ballot.
            The contemporary belief that Willkie was carried to victory on a tidal wave of sound from the
                    galleries has survived despite the evidence that Taft's delegates in the Middle West, West,
                    and South stuck with him and were not stampeded. The first marked pro-Willkie demonstrations among
                    the spectators began during the first night session of June 24.68 When the
                    presidential balloting began three days later, the alliterative appeal of "We Want
                    Willkie" had become almost deafening. The millions of people listening intently over their
                    radios to the proceedings in 
                        Philadelphia
                     received the indelible impression that the convention hall was controlled by Willkie
                    supporters. The actual effect on the delegates themselves is difficult to assess accurately. The
                    relentless chant may have swayed some who were undecided and uncommitted. An editorial writer for
                    William Allen White's Emporia Gazette attributed the Kansans'
                    change of front to the waves of pro-Willkie mail flowing from the folks back home.69 But other delegates were openly annoyed by the nerve-jangling uproar. One political
                    reporter commented: "It was highly interesting to observe the animated resentment on the
                    faces of many of the delegates, some of whom, glaring angrily at the cheering spectators, were
                    booing back at the Willkie partisans."70 Some delegates, resting in
                    their hotel rooms after the pandemonium of the convention floor, were irked when they were disturbed
                    by the delivery of fresh batches of pro-Willkie telegrams. Other thrifty delegates complained when
                    they totaled the tips dispensed into the hands of waiting bellboys for delivery of the pro-Willkie
                        messages.71 The organized cheering for Willkie may even have backfired to
                    the extent that it drove supporters of other major candidates to work harder. The Taft leaders, for
                    example, were incensed when they became convinced that Samuel Pryor, Jr., chairman of the committee
                    on arrangements, had

                     deliberately packed the galleries with leather-lunged Willkie
                        partisans.72
            
            But the most well-preserved and widely circulated of the myths clustering around the nomination of
                    Willkie is that his victory was a political miracle because he came to 
                        Philadelphia
                     lacking an organization which could translate his demonstrated popularity with the
                    people into the hard currency of convention votes. On the contrary, before the trial by ballot began
                    a thoroughly professional corps of Willkie managers drawn from across the nation was mapping plans
                    for convention strategy. Such youthful governors as Raymond Baldwin, of 
                        Connecticut
                    , William Vanderbilt, of 
                        Rhode Island
                    , Leverett Saltonstall, of 
                        Massachusetts
                    , Harold Stassen, of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , and Ralph Carr, of 
                        Colorado
                    , had aligned themselves with Willkie. From among the national committeemen he could
                    rely on Samuel Pryor, of 
                        Connecticut
                    , Walter Hallanan, of 
                        West Virginia
                    , and Sinclair Weeks, of 
                        Massachusetts
                    . A sprinkling of Republican congressmen were found among Willkie's convention
                    backers: Clifford Hope, of 
                        Kansas
                    , Charles Halleck, of Indiana, Frank Horton, of 
                        Wyoming
                    , and Bruce Barton, of 
                        New York
                    .
            In addition, while the 1940 convention was not bossed in the traditional sense of the word, there
                    were a number of state leaders willing and able to provide Willkie with vital transfusions of votes
                    at critical junctures. Standouts among this group were Mayor Rolland Marvin, of
                            
                  Syracuse, New York
                            County
                Chairman Kenneth Simpson, Alfred M. Landon, of 
                        Kansas
                    , Senator Styles Bridges, of 
                        New Hampshire
                    , and Frank Harris, of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . Willkie also benefited from the enthusiasm he had kindled in a number of previously
                    inarticulate Republican businessmen, such as Edgar M. Queeny, of 
                        Missouri
                    , and Paul J. Kreusi, of 
                        Tennessee
                    , who then became active in the organizational politics at a state level which produces
                    votes at national conventions.
            Finally, Willkie owed much to the favorite sons who played a key role in the convention. After
                    Dewey's bid for a first-ballot nomination had fallen short, the Willkie and Taft managers
                    worked feverishly to fill their ranks not only with Dewey's former followers but also from
                    among the 346 delegates who had sat on the fence during the first round 
                  
                     72
                            
                                New York
                            
                            Times, June 27, 1940.
               
                     and voted for favorite sons. A series of decisions for Willkie
                    on the part of favorite sons, or their delegates, were decisive in tipping the scales in his favor.
                    The bulk of the support originally pledged to Arthur Vandenberg, Joseph Martin, Styles Bridges,
                    Arthur Capper, Charles McNary, Arthur James, and Frank Gannett found its way to Willkie. Only the
                    handful of delegates grouped around Hanford MacNider and Harlan Bushfield elected to transfer their
                    allegiance to Taft.
            Willkie was undeniably a political amateur in 1940; but he gave exceptional promise of being a
                    winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party,
                    queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership to entrust its political
                    fortunes to a man without political experience. In most of the previous instances, the nomination
                    had gone to a military man. In 1940 it went to a businessman. Willkie was nominated not as the
                    result of a political miracle but by hard work and skillful management.
         
         
         
            The Social Philosophy of Albert J. Beveridge
            
                    Daniel Levine
                    ∗
                
            Albert J. Beveridge was a successful lawyer in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , a senator from Indiana for two terms (1899–1911), one of the
                    standard-bearers for the Bull Moose party in 1912, and later a biographer of distinction. Starting
                    from a poor, rural background, he achieved success through high intelligence, oratorical and
                    political skill, and strenuous effort. Beveridge began his political career as a regular Republican
                    then, about 1905, joined forces with the insurgent or Progressive Republicans and became one of the
                    leaders of that group. His political career has been, and is being, dealt with by others.1 These pages are concerned with the basic social philosophy which lay behind
                    his actions through 1912. Beveridge's ideas about reform place him in that stream of
                    Progressive thought which emphasized the importance of the national government in bringing about
                    change. Herbert Croly and Walter Lipmann provided the philosophic basis for this group. Theodore
                    Roosevelt, with strong support from Albert Beveridge, was its most potent political spokesman.
            In various ways Beveridge extolled the power of the national government. In domestic affairs he urged
                    the use of national power for everything from putting down the Pullman strike to limiting child
                    labor. In foreign affairs he urged an expansion of American power and political control in the
                    Caribbean and Far East. The characterization of Beveridge as a nationalist is beyond dispute. To say
                    that he was a nationalist, however, is not enough. His nationalism was one manifestation of a more
                    comprehensive social philosophy which rested on his ideas of race, order, and power.
            Along with many other men of the late nineteenth century,2 Beveridge believed
                    that the ultimate force driving

                     human society was a deep racial or blood instinct. Each race,
                    he thought, had a collective soul which harbored a drive in a certain direction. This drive had to
                    be followed. "The key to my speech was racial," he wrote in 1900. "I
                    consider conventional ethics and conventional morals man-made and therefore finite as of absolutely
                    no moment compared to the higher and enduring ethic of our race."3
            
            When Beveridge used the term "our race" he generally meant the Anglo-Saxon race.
                    The Anglo-Saxons had produced the great explorers of Elizabethan days whose "blood within
                    them commanded them" to seek out far lands. "Their racial tendency is as
                    resistless as the currents of the sea …. " "God has not been preparing
                    the English-speaking and Teutonic peoples for a thousand years for nothing but vain and idle
                    self-contemplation and self-admiration. No! He has made us the master organizers of the
                    world…. "4 Beveridge viewed the Anglo-Saxons as congenitally
                    a self-governing race. Therefore beyond any man-made law there was "institutional law with
                    its roots springing from the very soul of our race."5
            
            Americans and Canadians partook directly of this racial heritage. Close behind them were the Germans.
                    The natives of southern and eastern Europe were not of the best type, although Beveridge had
                    considerable regard for the Slavs. The lowest rung on the racial ladder was occupied by Asiatics. An
                    Oriental, he thought, was not capable of refinement and education. The Chinese had deep character
                    faults, the most important of which was too much regard for self and family and not enough for the
                        community.6 He insisted that the Filipinos, like children, were incapable of
                    running their own affairs. They needed the guiding hand of traditionally self-governing Anglo-Saxons
                    to lead them to the light.7

            Sometimes Beveridge's racism seemed to demand a rigid separation of the races. When he was
                    defending colonial status for the Philippines, he said, "The prospect of Puerto Rican,
                    Filipino and Hawaiian Senators and Congressmen, which is the ultimate conclusion of the argument of
                    the Constitution extending over these possessions is not a spectacle to be viewed
                        calmly."8 In Asiatic Russia where he saw many races mingling freely
                    he said that Anglo-Saxons were naturally startled by seeing this sort of racial harmony.9 Later, however, when arguing for a unified state of 
                        Arizona
                     and 
                        New Mexico
                    , he emphasized the easy amalgamation of Spanish and American blood and gave racial
                    mixing high credit for producing America's greatness.10
            
            The second of Beveridge's basic beliefs was the importance of order in society. He defined
                    liberty as that which is "realized only by him who obeys those common rules of action
                    called laws by which alone liberty lives."11 Civilization meant
                    "liberty and law, … commerce and communication, … social order and
                    the Gospel of our Lord…. "12 He praised the Puritans because
                    order was to them "as necessary as honesty; law as essential as liberty; government as
                    important as resistance to wrong."13 He praised the Jews and the
                    Germans as people who had learned the value of social cohesion rather than conflict.14 Richelieu, Edmund Burke, and George Washington were great not because of their wisdom
                    or vision but because all three had brought order out of chaos.15 Beveridge
                    regarded the French Revolution not as a triumph of democracy but as a catastrophe because it had led
                    to violence.16 The need for order was another reason

                     that the 
                        United States
                     should keep the Philippines: that natives "like all backward peoples need to
                    be taught orderly continuous labor before anything else."17
            
            Beveridge's attitude toward order was most strikingly illustrated in his reaction to czarist
                    Russia. On his journey through Manchuria in 1901, he saw Russian methods of colonization. He was
                    favorably impressed by the Russians' swift, brutal justice, and praised them for killing
                    three thousand robbers in six weeks. Since the Russians were bringing order out of chaos, their
                    methods were justified.18 In the book, The Russian Advance,
                    which he wrote about this journey, Beveridge devoted one chapter to comparing three Russians. He had
                    high praise for Sergei Witte, finance minister, who was trying to reorganize czarist finance on
                    European lines. He approved also of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a close advisor to the czar and an
                    archreactionary. Beveridge also visited a third Russian whom he denounced as an unrealistic dreamer
                    who, if he had any effect at all upon the world, would have a bad effect. This man was a nobleman
                    living the life of a peasant, Count Leo Tolstoy.19
            
            Closely related to Beveridge's regard for order was his awe of power, almost without regard
                    for who wielded it or for what ends. This was another reason for his high regard for Pobedonostsev.
                    In the Bible, Beveridge admired above all others save Christ himself, David and Moses, the warrior
                    and the lawgiver, power and order.20 Puritans were good because they were
                    "Honesty with Sword in hand; … Liberty on the charge…. "21 Terms of praise he employed included "national manhood" and
                    "master among nations."22 He had tremendous respect for the
                    Russian Orthodox church, not because of its doctrine or its moral teachings but because of the power
                    it held over the Russian people and the fervency of the loyalty it inspired.23

            These were the basic tenets of Beveridge's social philosophy: a firm belief in a blood
                    consciousness which led each race to an inevitable destiny, a respect for power, pure and simple,
                    and a desire for order in all social functions. All else was merely particularization of these basic
                    beliefs.
            Beveridge's nationalism was based on his desire for order and efficiency and his respect for
                    power. His views were most clearly expounded in his speech on Governor John P. Altgeld's
                    action in the Pullman strike of 1894. President Grover 
                        Cleveland
                     had sent in troops to quell violence, and Altgeld had protested that the troops were
                    not needed and that in fact the President had no right to send troops until the governor of a state
                    requested such aid. Although Beveridge was a Republican, his speech, given at the height of the
                    presidential campaign of 1896, supported the Democratic President.24 Beveridge
                    denounced Altgeld for supporting the proposition "that the general government cannot
                    suppress red riot, extinguish the fires of arson and protect property from destruction and life from
                    frenzy blinded mobs without the consent of the governor of the state." The Hoosier Senator
                    called Altgeld's position "the principle of national decay."
            Beveridge maintained that the federal government represented a single people divided into states
                    merely for administrative convenience and that the president represented that single people. Every
                    locality had a responsibility to the nation and must not be allowed to disrupt national affairs with
                    local disturbances. The president should use his power to preserve order, for "hesitation
                    of power is the food upon which mobs grow formidable and fierce. The danger that threatens our
                    future is local demagogues—not federal despots…. "25 In this speech Beveridge clearly stated his belief in order, power, and nationalism; and by
                    calling the Pullman strike a local disturbance and equating it with "red riot" he
                    showed a certain lack of comprehension of the economic developments going on around him.
            As a nationalist, Beveridge praised all those in the past who had increased the power of the federal
                    government. Thomas Jefferson's purchase of 
                        Louisiana
                     and Andrew Jackson's actions in 
                        Florida
                     were both patriotic. George Washington, 
                  
                     24 Albeit 
                                Cleveland
                             was not a candidate in 1896.

                     Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and above all,
                    John Marshall were never tyrants or self-seekers; they were nation builders and deserved the thanks
                    of the nation they wrought.26 Not only the executive but also the legislative
                    branch of the federal government had extensive power. A particular locality might not know what
                    course was in its own best interest, but the federal government, with its broader constituency,
                        would.27 Beveridge derided the doctrine of states' rights as merely
                    a device behind which evildoers hid for their own selfish ends. Since the federal government
                    represented all of the people at once, and the states represented all the people divided into
                    forty-six pieces, there was no danger of federal tyranny. The nation could not harm the states, for
                    that would be self-harm.28
            
            A logical outgrowth of Beveridge's praise for centralized power was his approval of
                    concentration both in labor and industry.29 He regarded huge business
                    organizations as a natural outgrowth of industrialization. Just as the reaper consolidated the
                    functions of many individuals, the corporation consolidated the functions of numerous small shops.
                    The huge corporation, like the reaper, brought gains in efficiency and therefore lowered unit cost.
                    Moreover, Beveridge thought that these corporations could not be effectively dissolved. He
                    recognized that corporations occasionally abused their power, but he thought that these scattered
                    abuses could be curbed with little difficulty. The only agent which could, in his

                     opinion, effectively police the corporations was the federal
                        government.30
            
            For similar reasons, Beveridge acknowledged the necessity for labor to organize. He did not argue
                    that labor had to organize in order to do battle with capital. Class conflict was not for him a
                    pressing concern. He simply acknowledged that the new industrial system led naturally to labor
                    organizations. These were useful, he thought, as schools for self-government, mutual improvement,
                    and self-respect. How different these purposes were from those envisioned by Samuel Gompers, who saw
                    labor as an army.31
            
            Power, order, and efficiency, then, were qualities which Beveridge thought important in society. He
                    did not, however, envision a static society. How did he think society developed? What caused change
                    in history? Beveridge's answer was destiny—great irresistible forces drove human
                    society onward, and men had to conform to them. One aspect of destiny was the blood-instinct, the
                    racial genius which has already been touched upon. There were other forces too. One of these was
                    simply an ineluctable process of social maturation. Beveridge had a clearly anthropomorphic view of
                    society. Societies started as children, grew into youths, matured, and then declined into senility.
                    Social organisms, like life itself, obeyed the laws of growth. In this conception of society as an
                    organism he joined the Social Darwinists, who treated classes within a society and societies as a
                    whole simply as enlarged single organisms.32 In this type of organic society,
                    with natural laws of growth, Beveridge felt that the task of a political leader was simply to set
                    his nation on the path it ought naturally to follow. A mature nation should be expected

                     to engage in colonial endeavors, which could not be helped and
                    should not be resisted.33
            
            Beveridge considered other factors important in historical change. Economic development was one, but
                    only one among many. Geography also was an important factor. Geography drove Russia east and 
                        Japan
                     west. Beveridge accurately predicted in 1903 that the two would soon clash.34 In the same way, economic development and geography were forcing the 
                        United States
                     into the Pacific and the Caribbean.35 Another force pushing this
                    nation to expand was the duty to civilize the barbaric nations of the world. Beveridge believed that
                    the civilized nations, having achieved social order, were not only justified in exporting order but
                    would betray their duty if they did not.36
            
            Like Theodore Roosevelt, Beveridge believed that one of the ways in which these divine drives could
                    be fulfilled was by war. "We hearken not to rhymers on universal peace, for we know that
                    with the sword the world has ever out of error carved its good estate…. I subscribe to
                    the doctrine of war. It is the divine instrument of progress. Every lasting victory of human freedom
                    was won upon the field."37
            
            But Beveridge agreed with Robert La Follette that most changes within a society ought to be planned
                    and worked out by experts. This point of view was partly an outgrowth of Beveridge's
                    respect for centralized and efficient power, for he pictured a commission of experts handing down
                    decisions which legislators and businessmen would be expected to follow. Partly too this view was a
                    result of Beveridge's confidence in destiny, for the experts would not determine policy

                     but merely the natural next step in an already destined
                    direction. He thought that scientific method could lead to absolute truth, leaving little room for
                    dispute. Beveridge praised the scientific method as employed in other countries: 
                        Canada
                    's conservation measures, 
                        Germany
                    's tariff commission, the careful planning which went into the freeing of the
                    serfs in Russia.38
            
            One of the major questions which all reformers have to face is that of the speed of change. Should
                    changes grow gradually out of past customs and institutions, or should these customs and
                    institutions be overturned to make room for new ones? Most people have, if not a consistent
                    philosophy, some sort of feeling for one approach or the other. In his first speech as a senator,
                    the speech urging the 
                        United States
                     to keep the Philippines, Beveridge argued for a great departure in American policy and
                    insisted that the nation should not be bound by the past. The 
                        United States
                     should grasp destiny and ride it wherever it might go. He insisted that the founding
                    fathers had intended the nation to be imperialistic, but he made no attempt to disguise the fact
                    that he was urging a considerable departure. "The end of it all," he wrote in
                    1898, "is that here we are. This situation is upon us. We cannot step out of it as of an
                    old pair of shoes, and the thing for us to do is bear ourselves in the noble way that characterizes
                    the lordly blood of our imperial race."39
            
            Beveridge insisted, still speaking of America's overseas expansion, that the
                    nation's hands must not be tied by the past. New situations demanded new answers.
                    Circumstances often required the exercise of powers not specified in the Constitution. That document
                    was not made to freeze our institutions as they were in 1787. "The march of nationality is
                    not to be withstood; and so the salvation of the constitution is in its capacity for
                        growth."40 "It has long been clear to

                    no paper barrier would stand in the way of a mighty people's development."41
            
            Beveridge remained fairly true to his idea of a destined development demanding new solutions which
                    nevertheless retained links with the past. Over the years, however, he changed his emphasis,
                    concentrating more and more on the links which each innovation had with the past. There may well be
                    a political explanation for this. As he became more identified with the insurgent wing of the
                    Republican party, he may have emphasized the conservative nature of his views in order to avoid
                    being tarred with a radical brush. As early as 1902 he was calling himself a conservative, but his
                    definition of that term was a loose one indeed. Conservatism simply meant change without
                        violence.42
            
            By 1906 Beveridge was clearly emphasizing the conservative nature of the reforms he had supported. He
                    said that regulation of business must be worked out gradually as the situation developed. He
                    insisted that laws such as the Hepburn Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act were simply natural
                    products of a changing situation, not new social experiments.43
            
            This conflict between conservatives and nonconservatives is closely related to a conflict over the
                    importance of ideas to society. Conservatives think that innovations should grow naturally out of
                    the past. They accuse nonconservatives of relying too heavily on ideas as generators of change.
                    Beveridge said that "public policies are wise only as they express a people's
                    development. This is why most of the plans of reformers fail, why most of the theories of dreamers
                    are idle. They are born of some individual's thought…. "44 In spite of the fact that he himself later became a recognized scholar and biographer,
                    his contempt for theorizers and bookish men was complete in these years. About the only books he
                    said were of any importance were the Bible, Shakespeare's works, and the writings of Bobby
                    Burns—of all people. Going to

                     college had a limited utility, but young men should go if they

                    experience and action were much more important. In 1898 he wrote: "As to Gladstone himself,
                    I cannot agree with you as to his greatness. He did not ‘do things.’ He
                    talked…. Give me the men who ‘do
                        things.’"46
            
            In a sense the denigration of intellect, which Beveridge himself would probably have repudiated in
                    later years, stands in contradiction to his belief that problems should be solved by experts. He
                    probably regarded experts, however, not as theorizers or men of intellect but as technicians dealing
                    with specific down-to-earth problems.
            Beveridge's respect for men who "‘do
                        things’" led him at first to equate achievement with moral excellence,
                    and wealth with achievement. Before he became senator, and during the first years of his senatorial
                    career, he extolled wealth as synonomous with excellence. In a statement supporting Benjamin
                    Harrison and the Republican party in 1892, Beveridge said, "Every step toward plenty and
                    comfort is a step toward civilization. Every step toward want and misery and endless toil is a step
                    toward barbarism."47 In his speeches for the 1892, 1894, and 1896
                    campaigns, he consistently equated prosperity and wealth with virtue. In arguing for imperialism, he
                    insisted that commerce was a method by which the savages could be civilized. Throughout his book,
                        The Young Man and the World, he equated financial success with excellence. He
                    extolled the career of Thomas R. Scott, president of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Railroad, saying that Scott's life "demonstrated that the very
                    ultimate of achieving,

                    know neither Latin nor Greek."18
            
            About 1906, statements began to appear in Beveridge's speeches and writings damning
                    commercial standards. Perhaps he became disillusioned with material standards, but no evidence has
                    been discovered of any soul searching on the subject nor even any evidence that Beveridge was aware
                    of contradicting himself. As early as 1906 he hoped that "financial interests"
                    would no longer be our national ideal.49 By 1910 he insisted that "the
                    curse of our present day is greed. We measure everything by dollars. We worship wealth."50 His keynote speech at the Bull Moose convention in 1912 was interlaced with
                    standard Progressive rhetoric against wealth.51
            
            Perhaps this shift in emphasis also has a political explanation. In the rising tide of Progressive
                    sentiment in the country, Beveridge may have seen a means for fulfillment of his own personal
                    ambitions. The Indiana Senator aimed at nothing less than the peak of political power. Perhaps most
                    politicians aim for the presidency, but Beveridge seemed to think that destiny would be shirking her
                    duty if she did not place him in the White House. His political rise had been rapid, but his egotism
                    grew even more rapidly. As a freshman senator he wanted a subcommittee chairmanship. He made a major
                    policy address almost as soon as he had taken his seat. This speech irritated his Senate colleagues,
                    but received enough national attention to fire his already heated ambition.
            By 1900 he was perhaps envisioning himself as a successor to William McKinley in 1904. He wrote, with
                    more optimism than good judgment, that "things are simply perfect here. I am in the inner
                    inside circle…" Then he spoke jubilantly of the formation of several Beveridge
                    for President clubs.52 After having been in public office for only

                     52 Beveridge to John C. Shaffer, January 26, [1900?], Beveridge
                            Papers.
               
                     eleven months, he wrote to George H. Lorimer, publisher of the
                        Saturday Evening Post, that his Philippine speech had received great support
                    in the South, and that he, Beveridge, might be the man to bring some southern strength to the
                    Republican party.53 He wrote of this southern support to one of his friends and
                    said that he would be very glad if he could "inspire [respect] in that finest and most
                    unadulterated of the Anglo-Saxon race."54
            
            Perhaps Beveridge's self-esteem should not be too harshly criticized, for it was not hidden
                    by hypocritical modesty. It was like the simple egotism of a child who has no doubt that he is the
                    precise center of the universe. "I have done some mighty big things over simply incredible
                    obstacles, and I think before you get through these ought to be recognized," he wrote to
                    his friend, David Graham Phillips, in 1908.55
            
            To what extent was Beveridge a Progressive in the sense of consistently favoring national control of
                    big business, social welfare legislation, and more direct popular influence on legislation? His
                    record was not so much one of slow growth toward Progressivism as of sudden conversion. In the
                    1890's Beveridge's speeches were standard Republican oratory. He waved the bloody
                    shirt with the best, praised prosperity and McKinley, wanted a high protective tariff, and damned
                    the Democrats. In the early years of the new century he extolled everything American, and as late as
                    1904 he entitled a speech "All is Well with the Republic" which was a hymn to
                    everything as it was.58 These sentiments stand in sharp contrast to those of
                    Robert La Follette, who from 1892 on saw impending doom unless basic changes were made in the
                    nation.
            Soon after the 1904 election, Beveridge had changed his views. By 1906 he could say that the
                    Republican party "must not stop." We must turn to these new social and economic
                    questions which have to do with the daily lives and happiness

                     of human beings.57 He wrote exultantly to
                    David Graham Phillips about Roosevelt's endorsement of radicalism in the inheritance
                        tax.58 In 1908, using language much like that of La Follette, he wrote to
                    the President: "I dislike legislation which gives people the impression that something very
                    much worthwhile has been done, when as a matter of fact very little has been done."59 In 1910 and 1911 Beveridge was arguing for more direct popular influence in
                    government and insisting that business and special interests must get out of government and let the
                    people rule.60
            
            By 1912 Beveridge was in the forefront of Progressivism. He was convinced that he had failed to be
                    re-elected in 1910 not because he had been too progressive but because the Republican party had not
                    been progressive enough.61 He felt that the only way to recoup his losses was to
                    continue as a vigorous Progressive, at least for the time being.62 He supported
                    Roosevelt in 1912 and delivered the keynote speech at the Bull Moose convention which endorsed woman
                    suffrage, initiative and referendum, and a host of social welfare and business control measures.
            All this is not to say that Beveridge was a complete hypocrite. Opportunism in some degree is a
                    necessity in politics. Moreover, his ambition drove him to assume whatever political posture he
                    thought could win elections, and he seems to have believed in whatever posture he assumed. More than
                    this, however, his basic social attitudes, like those of Theodore Roosevelt, were adaptable to the
                    needs of reform in the first years of the twentieth century. Before 1904 Beveridge had not shown any
                    great awareness of social ills, but he had shown enthusiasm for centralized, efficient power.

                     One important, and politically successful, strand of
                    Progressive thought considered centralized power the most useful tool for social reform. It was here
                    that Beveridge found his political home.
            Here then was a man who worshiped power, felt a mystical sense of racial and national destiny,
                    gloried in war and material success, and favored centralization of government. A quarter of a
                    century later similar ideas made themselves felt in 
                        Italy
                     and 
                        Germany
                     under Fascism. Does this mean that Beveridge was a Fascist, just a few decades ahead of
                    his time. Certainly there were facets of his thought similar to the ideas of Benito Mussolini and
                    Adolf Hitler, but there was one feature of his thinking which must forever rescue him from charges
                    of Fascism. This was his quiet, unquestioning faith in the Anglo-American democratic process. No
                    matter what his ambition or what his conception of destiny, he was dipped so deeply in
                    representative democracy that, even in defeat, he never considered abandoning it. At another time,
                    in another place, Beveridge's high regard for power and order might have led him in another
                    direction. During the first decade of the twentieth century in the 
                        United States
                    , it led him to Progressivism. Beveridge was not following reform, however, so much as
                    power.

            During the years preceding the outbreak of the Civil War, citizens of 
                        Mishawaka
                     were confused and frustrated by the increasing sectional bitterness that threatened to
                    divide the nation. After Fort Sumter, however, people who had not understood the threat of secession
                    or who could not believe that a civil war was close at hand had reacted to the outbreak of the war
                    with enthusiasm, patriotism, and determination to save the Union.1 Men
                    volunteered and were rushed into the fighting in western 
                        Virginia
                    , while at home citizens donated money and worked in various patriotic activities.
            During the year 1861 forces released by war became noticeable. Following the Bull Run disaster (July,
                    1861) there was some disillusionment in 
                        Mishawaka
                    , but there was also strong partisan reaction to peace meetings held in adjacent
                    communities; and war hysteria and intolerance influenced some people. Rising demand for army wagons
                    brought prosperity to the village. Factories worked at full capacity, while increased demand for
                    foodstuffs raised the income of farmers. Inflation increased the hardship of the poor and of the
                    soldiers' families. Gambling, drinking, and other forms of vice were more in evidence than
                    formerly. The numbers of men volunteering for new regiments being formed in northern Indiana
                    remained steady. Casualties on the battle fronts had touched few from the village; one
                    man—Robert Boyd—had died from disease in western 
                        Virginia
                    . After the volunteers had left the village for the fighting

                    constant fear that sickness, permanent disability, or death would come to a loved one. Mishawakans
                    had been sobered by developments during 1861, and there was little "flag waving"
                    patriotism. As the year 1862 opened, however, there was a feeling of optimism among the citizens
                    that their determination and sacrifices would help bring a successful end to the war and that the
                    Union would be maintained.2
            
            The village seemed empty with so many men in the army, for there was hardly a family that did not
                    have a loved one in far off western 
                        Virginia
                     or at 
                        Camp Ellis
                     at near-by 
                        Goshen
                    , Indiana. Active military movements of interest to local citizens had ceased during the
                    winter months, and participation in local social events and finding solutions to community problems
                    became the chief interest of Mishawakans during the early weeks of 1862.
            An outbreak of smallpox in neighboring towns caused a scare in the village, and, although the disease
                    did not make headway in 
                        Mishawaka
                    , parents were advised by Dr. William Butterworth not to neglect to have their children
                        vaccinated.3 On January 7 the women's guild of the Episcopal Church
                    gave an oyster supper at the Milburn House to raise money for their contingent expense fund. Tickets
                    were available for 37$1/2¢, and the public was invited. The supper was
                    excellent, and the entertainment, which consisted of a "grab bag" mail delivery,
                    provided an enjoyable evening for those attending.4 The following week a
                    donation party was held at the home of Reverend Jacob Merrifield. Ladies brought "piles of
                    choice eatables," and monetary donations came to $50. Much credit for the
                    success of this party was given to Mr. Frank Butler, who used his team and buggy to transport
                    unescorted ladies home from the party.5
            
            Two robberies committed Sunday night, January 19, caused much excitement for the citizens. The post
                    office and the grocery store of Stephen H. Judkins were entered and ransacked. At the post office,
                    money and stamps were

                     taken, but the amount stolen could not be determined. Letters
                    were torn apart and their contents scattered over the floor; it was believed that $25
                    were taken from one letter, $15 from another, and a draft for $80 from still
                    another. The thief did not find much at the Judkins store—only two or three dollars in
                    coppers and a counterfeit three-dollar bill were taken. No clues to the thief's identity
                    were discovered; this type of robbery had occurred in the past, however, and the consensus was that
                    the thief lived in town and committed a new robbery whenever he needed funds.6
            
            One of the problems that confronted the citizens of 
                        Mishawaka
                     during the early weeks of 1862 was keeping free schools open for their children. 
                        Mishawaka
                     had acquired an enviable reputation for having good schools, and its citizens and
                    teachers had been praised for their cooperation and support of education.7 In
                    1848 the town board had levied a school tax of $1.40 on each $100 of property
                        evaluation,8 and in 1849 the first in a series of meetings was held that
                    resulted in the formation in 1851 of the Northern Indiana Teachers' Institute, which became
                    an association of importance for educators in the northern part of the state.9
                    Prominent Indiana educators such as Rufas Patch were allowed to use the 
                        Mishawaka
                     buildings to operate private schools.10 The 
                        Mishawaka
                     Normal and Academic Institution, a free grade school and a tuition normal school, soon
                    acquired a good reputation throughout the surrounding areas for

                            in a list of outstanding educators in Indiana and states: "These were men who gave
                            character to the surviving educational sentiment of their respective neighborhoods; men who
                            left enduring marks upon the local institutions, and made or reformed the
                            communities' reputation."
               
                     academic excellence.11 In 1857, when the
                    Indiana Supreme Court ruled that incorporated towns could not levy a tax for tuition purposes, it
                    became very difficult for 
                        Mishawaka
                     to maintain its free schools.12
                    
                        Mishawaka
                     had no winter term of free school in 1859, and the only schools open in the village
                    were the 
                        Mishawaka
                     Institute and private subscription schools.18 In 1861 Robert
                    Whitson, the 
                        Mishawaka
                     school trustee, by spending money which he hoped to get from the next year's
                    distribution of state common school funds and by borrowing from the local special school fund, was
                    able to keep the schools open for a total of 133 days with an average daily attendance of 234
                        pupils.14 An act passed by the general assembly in 1861 stopped this method
                    of school financing by prohibiting school trustees from using anticipated revenue; therefore, when
                    the money received by the town from the state common school fund was exhausted, free schools in 
                        Mishawaka
                     were forced to close.18
            
            Late in January, 1862, the Enterprise announced the closing of free schools in the
                    village. School No. 2, on the north side of the St. Joseph River, under the
                    supervision of Reverend Jacob Merrifield, had had a "very profitable and pleasant
                    term," and on the last day of school, pupils were rewarded by a party at the home of
                    Reverend Merrifield. The 
                        Mishawaka
                     Academic and Normal Institute, Professor Lloyd D. Willard, principal, closed a few days
                    later. The Enterprise stated that the Institute term had been beneficial for all
                    who attended, that there had been no complaints, and that students had been satisfied with their
                    teachers and courses of study.16

                        borrowed from the special school fund for the common school fund. Teachers' salaries
                        amounting to $570.70 were then paid from the common school fund.

                    In the matter of this free school I have had it my own way, and so long as it is my duty to look
                        after the welfare of the schools, I must have it my way. The school has been taught 82 days at a
                        cost of $757.68, which consumes all the money in my hands or to come for this winter.
                        I received from appropriations $817.84, but owing to overdrawing last winter, it made
                        our school about ten days less than it would have been.17
               
                
            Whitson announced that in 1861 the general assembly had passed a bill to amend the constitution so
                    that incorporated towns would have power to raise revenue by taxation for tuition in addition to
                    funds derived for that purpose from the state. He urged that "every one should use his
                    influence to bring about so desirable a change." Before the meeting adjourned, citizens
                    voted to continue the village schools in their graded form as long as money was available.18
            
            Village social activities and problems were important to citizens, but their chief concern and worry
                    was the welfare of the many volunteers from the community. The Ninth Indiana Infantry, of which
                    Company I was made up of volunteers from 
                        Mishawaka
                     and Penn Township, had spent the winter on top of Cheat Mountain in western 
                        Virginia
                    . The experiences of the Ninth on Cheat Mountain had not been pleasant ones, for there
                    had been much sickness in the regiment because of exposure to the terrible weather,18 and home folks were relieved when news reached the village that the Ninth was to be moved
                    to 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               .20
            
            On January 9, the regiment left Cheat Mountain with orders to proceed to 
                        Louisville
                    .21 The men were happy to leave their winter camp, and one 
                        Mishawaka
                     volunteer stated in a letter home when "we left Cheat Mountain … we

            There was much sickness and a number of deaths while the regiment was at 
                        Fetterman
                    , and the men became discouraged, for rumor had it that they were to be kept
                    "among these miserable mountains."24 On February 19 the
                    regiment was ordered to 
                        Louisville
                     and placed in Brigadier General William Nelson's division of Major General Don

                    in army life at 
                        Camp Ellis
                    , in 
                        Goshen
                    .26 The Forty-eighth Regiment had been handicapped in securing its
                    necessary number of recruits. A new recruiting system, announced by General George B. McClellan on
                    December 3, 1861, had implied that the Union army was large enough and that no additional volunteers
                    were needed.27 The unusually severe winter of 1861–1862 and the
                    almost total lack of any preparation for the care of the enlisted men greatly retarded
                        enlistment.28 Also, the districts from which men to fill the regiment would
                    be drawn had been well canvassed previously to secure

                     men for other regiments.20 The result was that the prospect of
                    filling the regiment had not been good, but the necessary number of volunteers was finally obtained,
                    partly because of the popularity and hard work of Colonel Norman Eddy, of 
                        South Bend
                    , and partly because of the enthusiastic support of Colonel Eddy's many friends
                    in northern Indiana.30
            
            To encourage enlistment, many patriotic meetings had been held in 
                        St. Joseph County
                    . One held in 
                        Mishawaka
                     on November 3, 1861, during which patriotic speeches were made by prominent citizens of
                    the village, aroused enthusiasm for volunteering.31 As a result of these many
                    enlistment meetings, a large proportion of the officers and men of the Forty-eighth Regiment were
                    from 
                        St. Joseph County
                    , and the regiment became a favorite of the citizens of the county.32 That the regiment was a favorite of 
                        Mishawaka
                     citizens would account for the numerous gifts given to its officers by prominent
                    Mishawakans. John Niles, owner of the 
                        St. Joseph
                     Manufacturing Company, gave Colonel Eddy a "beautiful high mettled
                    steed," and George Milburn, local wagon manufacturer, gave him a handsome saddle.33 Later, Milburn presented Colonel Eddy, Captain Barnett Byrkit, and
                    Lieutenants William A. Judkins and Crawford McDonald each "a most beautiful sword and
                    belt." The Enterprise reported the gifts and then added: "We

                     was not far away, so there were many opportunities for volunteers to come home and for
                    citizens to visit Camp Ellis. Early in January, villagers were surprised to see Captain Byrkit and
                    his company march into town. The men had hiked from 
                        Goshen
                     in a half-day, and the consensus was that they made a very good and soldierly
                    appearance as they arrived.35 Individual soldiers also found the opportunity to
                    visit the village on numerous occasions. One soldier recorded that he did the usual things while at
                    home: dating, going to church, having tea with friends, sleigh riding to 
                        South Bend
                    , and having a good time with the home folks.36 On January 8 many 
                        Mishawaka
                     citizens took advantage of a special railroad excursion fare of 40¢ to visit
                    their men at 
                        Camp Ellis
                    . Their special train of fourteen cars arrived in 
                        Goshen
                     around noon. The volunteers were relieved of their military duties, and they and their
                    visitors spent a pleasant afternoon and evening together. The editor of the 
                        Goshen
                    
                    Times stated that everything was fine except that a street fight was started by
                    some of the "Bully's" from 
                        South Bend
                    , but they were promptly thrown in jail by the town marshal.37
            
            Not long after the excursion to Camp Ellis, a rumor was repeated in the village that many of the men
                    in the Forty-eighth Regiment were sick with smallpox. This was disturbing news for home folks,
                    especially when a later rumor had it that the citizens of 
                        Goshen
                    , being afraid that the disease would spread among their families, were refusing to
                    allow sick soldiers to remain in town.38 Both rumors proved to be

                            commissary sergeant from 1862 to 1864 and as quartermaster from 1864 until the end of the
                            war. Judkins kept a daily record of his experiences from January 1, 1862, until July 27,
                            1865. This four-volume, handwritten diary is in the possession of Judkins'

                     false. There was sickness in the regiment, but no smallpox;38 Captain Byrkit, a carpenter by profession, was ordered to have his men build
                    a hospital at camp, and all sick soldiers were moved from 
                        Goshen
                     when smallpox was found in the town.40
            
            The men had little to complain about while at 
                        Camp Ellis
                    . Their quarters were comfortable and food was plentiful; however, after the
                    organization of the regiment was completed, the continuous drill and monotony of camp life was
                    boring to men who were anxious to "pull trigger on the secesh."41 At last, in the latter part of January, orders were received for the regiment to recall all
                    absentees and to be ready to move in a few days.42
            
            The news that the Forty-eighth would soon leave 
                        Goshen
                     reached 
                        Mishawaka
                    , and about fifty people decided to make a last visit to Camp Ellis. This time they
                    traveled by sleigh, and since the snow was well packed, the journey took but three hours. The men
                    were busy preparing for their departure, but the regiment was paraded for the visitors, and the 
                        Mishawaka
                     people noted with some pride that Captain Byrkit was the largest captain in the
                    regiment. After seeing all their friends at the camp, the 
                        Mishawaka
                     folks returned to 
                        Goshen
                    , where they had a late afternoon dinner before starting home. The journey back to 
                        Mishawaka
                     was an enjoyable one; each sleighing party vied with the others in singing hymns and
                    patriotic songs. All groups arrived safely in the village about eight o'clock.43

                        admitted to the hospital; of these, fifty-one had measles. From January 23 to February 7 there
                        was an outbreak of measles at 
                            Camp Ellis
                        , and thirty-seven men were placed in the hospital because of this epidemic, which
                        may account for the smallpox rumor received in

            The Forty-eighth Regiment left 
                        Goshen
                     on February 7. The men marched from Camp Ellis to the railroad station and were cheered
                    by 
                        Goshen
                     citizens who "thronged the streets," but the regimental historian
                    stated: "In black overcoats and without arms our display was not strikingly
                        military."44 The troop trains were scheduled to arrive in 
                        Mishawaka
                     at ten o'clock, and a large gathering of citizens was at the station with the
                    military band to give the men a rousing send-off. The trains were late and many citizens, thinking
                    the men were not coming, went home; however, when the trains did arrive at one o'clock, a
                    large crowd was still at the station and the men were given a good farewell.45
                    The journey to Cairo, 
                        Illinois
                    , was interesting but tiring for the Hoosier boys. Some of them saw sand dunes and
                        Lake Michigan for the first time, and the rocks and hills of the coal
                    mining country in southern 
                        Illinois
                     were also novel and exciting.46 The men arrived in 
                        Cairo
                     at five o'clock on February 8, and the next day they were transported by
                    steamer to 
                        Paducah
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    .47 The regiment was under orders to proceed up the
                        Tennessee River to Fort Donelson to reinforce General James B. McPherson.
                    Not being completely armed, the regiment was held at 
                        Paducah
                    ; some companies were detailed to be trained as artillerists and others assigned to the
                    provost marshal for guard duty.48
            
            After the departure of the men from Camp Ellis, village events again became the chief concern and
                    interest of 
                        Mishawaka
                     citizens. Early in February a sharp rise in temperature melted the winter snow, and
                    when heavy rains came, the village and surrounding country were in danger of floods. There was fear
                    for a time that the high water would damage local factories, but serious flooding was averted when a
                    fall in temperature caused the river and races to freeze. Water-wheels

                    manufacturing in the village ceased, but no permanent damage resulted from the high water.49
            
            There was at this time an optimistic feeling in the village that the war would end in a few months.
                    George Milburn, who had been in 
                        Washington
                     negotiating for more government contracts for his wagons, reported to the editor of the
                        Enterprise when he returned that the Army of the Potomac was about to move and
                    that it was the consensus in 
                        Washington
                     that "we have got the rebels into such a fix now that they must succumb
                        soon."50 A short time later the Enterprise
                    carried an announcement that the last meeting of the Soldiers' Aid Society would be held at
                    the home of Mr. Oliver T. Niles on Monday afternoon and evening, February 24. The local society had
                    done a great amount of work since its organization in October, 1861.51 The
                    inactivity of the military forces during the past winter and the villagers' belief that the
                    coming military campaigns of the Union armies would crush the rebellion caused a decline in
                    enthusiasm for soldier relief work. Meetings of the society were poorly attended, and the
                    organization was dying from lack of interest and support by local people.52
            
            Union victories bolstered the belief that the rebellion would soon be crushed. The news of the

                        Tennessee

                     men ran excitedly to spread the glorious news. Flags were run
                    up on all important buildings, and the village assumed a festive air in celebration of the
                    victories. In the evening, a number of men gathered to continue the celebration. A large demijohn of
                    whiskey was placed in the center of Main Street and was named Fort Donelson. Men
                    "surrounded it and made many furious onslaughts upon it with a view of capturing the
                    contents … at last they succeeded in their object—taking the
                        ‘Fort.’"58
            
            Neither 
                        Mishawaka
                     company was with General Grant at 
                        Fort Donelson
                    . The Ninth was still at 
                        Fetterman
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , and the Forty-eighth was at 
                        Paducah
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    . At Puducah, the experiences of the men of the Forty-eighth were not pleasant, for it
                    was a time of much sickness, discouragement, and a lowering of morale. The delay in receiving its
                    equipment kept the regiment on garrison duty, and even when finally supplied, four companies had to
                    be content with old, inferior Belgian rifles.54 The men were not kept together;
                    four companies were detached for drill as artillerists, and several for duty as wharf and provost
                    guards. These detachments hindered regimental drill and discipline, and there was little opportunity
                    for officers and men to work together to develop esprit de corps.
               55 It was also a time of short rations for commissioned officers; the paymaster had overlooked
                    them, and officers did not have money to buy food for their mess.56 The enlisted
                    men were forced to live in old, rotten tents which gave little protection from rain and cold; this
                    exposure increased sickness among the poorly disciplined and discouraged volunteers. While the men
                    were at 
                        Puducah
                    , 187 were hospitalized, and 26 died from measles, pneumonia,

                     diarrhea, and fever.57 Patrick Shields,

                        Mishawaka
                     company, were among those who died.58
            
            In the latter part of March came disappointment. The regiment was ordered to join General William
                    Tecumseh Sherman at 
                        Pittsburg
                     Landing, 
                        Tennessee
                    , but at the last moment orders were changed, and the Sixth 
                        Iowa
                     Volunteers replaced the Indiana regiment. This was a bitter blow to morale, and several
                    officers, believing that the war would be over before they would get away from Paducah, threatened
                    to resign and then volunteer for duty with a regiment already at the front.59
                    This change of orders was perhaps a fortunate one for the men of the Forty-eighth Regiment. The
                    Sixth 
                        Iowa
                     joined General Sherman, was heavily engaged at the battle of 
                        Shiloh
                    , and sustained casualties of 183 men.60

                        Mishawaka
                     during March, the villagers experienced one of the worst storms of the year. It rained,
                    sleeted, and then snowed to a depth of eight inches, causing very disagreeable conditions for a few
                    days. Nonetheless, fine spring "sugar weather" soon arrived, and local farmers
                    made large quantities of maple sugar which they sold to villagers for 10¢ a pound.61 With the coming of spring, there was an increase of interesting activities
                    for home folks. For example, young people started their popular pastime of night serenading; the
                    editor of the Enterprise reported that young people serenaded him one night with
                    his favorite Negro melodies and that he enjoyed the singing and wished the young people would come
                    again soon.62

                        "we will bet our old hat that no regiment of as good soldiers as the 48th is composed
                        of will ever be permitted to return home until it has had a chance to test its mettle."

            The Enterprise printed a report by School Trustee Whitson showing that the financial condition of the 
                        Mishawaka
                     schools was not good. The common school fund had a balance of only $3.32,
                    while the special school fund had a deficit of $149.22.63 Later
                    Whitson announced that the winter term of the 
                        Mishawaka
                     Normal and Academic Institute would end on April 11. Examinations in the senior
                    department would be held on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; and in the primary department
                    examinations would be on Thursday afternoon. On Friday, rhetorical exercises and singing would be
                    given between classes, and the term would be concluded on Monday evening, April 14, with dialogues,
                    declamations, and singing. All patrons and others interested in education were cordially invited to
                    attend closing ceremonies.64
            
            A farewell donation party for the Methodist minister, Reverend Mr. Thomas Stabler, who was being
                    transferred, was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Fay and was an important social function.
                    Seventy-one dollars was donated by guests, and a very nice evening was had by all. The following
                    Sunday, the Reverend Mr. Stabler preached his last 
                        Mishawaka
                     sermon, which he ended with these words: "When I came among you two years ago
                    our country was at peace, now as I am about to leave you it is distracted by a civil war. My parting
                    words are … stand by the flag of your country and the Cross of Jesus Christ."65
            
            There was crime that spring. The smokehouse of Fred Maurer was entered, and sixteen hams and
                    shoulders and a half-barrel of soap were taken. The Enterprise stated: "A
                    search warrant and the closest scrutiny have failed, as yet, to discover their whereabouts or who
                    the thieves are." Also, a man from 
                        South Bend
                    , Charles Clemmens, was wounded by a shotgun blast. Clemmens had been drinking heavily
                    at a "low doggery," called the "Break-o-Day," two miles west of 
                        Mishawaka
                    . When refused any more to drink he started a fight, kicked down the stove, and beat the
                    woman who ran the establishment. The woman's son grabbed a gun and wounded Clemmens in the
                    back of the neck; fortunately, the gun was not heavily loaded, or Clemmens might have been killed.
                    None of the people involved was arrested, and Clemmens was able to ride home the next day.66

                     With the coming of spring and the increased activity of the
                    Union armies, villagers showed renewed interest in the experiences of their volunteers. The Ninth

                  Nashville, Tennessee

                     Giles wrote on March 9 that in a recent inspection Company I was commended by Colonel
                    William B. Hazen, Nineteenth Brigade commander, for having the cleanest guns and quarters in the
                    brigade. He added that this praise "made Captain Houghton feel very proud, and I guess the
                    boys didn't feel bad about it either."67 A letter printed by

                        South Bend
                    ) told of a training march by General Nelson's division on which the men had a
                    chance for some historical sight-seeing.
            
                    … we marched twelve miles on the 
                            Lebanon
                         pike, to the old "Hermitage," once the residence of General
                        Jackson, and saw the house in which he lived and died, and also his tomb; the house is in good
                        condition though it has been standing for a good many years; the yard is fixed off in fine
                        style, and looks beautiful. While we were marching round and looking at the tomb, the cannon
                        fired a national salute of 34 guns; we wasted about two and a half hours and returned to camp,
                        where we arrived at sundown, having marched 24 miles from six a.m. to this time.68
               
                
            Sergeant William H. Criswell, of Company I, came home on recruiting service in March, but he had been
                    home only a short time when all recruiting was stopped by order of the federal government, and
                    recruiting officers were ordered to return to their regiments.69 Criswell
                    announced in the Enterprise that he would take back with him any letters or
                    packages that home folks might wish to send to their loved ones. Before he could leave, however,

                            Enterprise, April 12, 1862; Secretary of War Edwin B. Stanton issued a
                            general order on April 3, 1862, stating that "the recruiting service for volunteers
                            will be discontinued in every State from this date. The officers detached on volunteer
                            recruiting service will join their regiments without delay…." U.S., War

                            stopping all recruiting was "one of the colossal blunders of the
                        war."

            The Ninth Indiana was in Nelson's division of General Buell's Army of the 
                        Ohio
                     that reinforced General Grant's hard-pressed men at 
                        Shiloh
                     late Sunday evening, April 6. Nelson's division, the van of Buell's
                    army, had left 
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , on March 17, and had moved by easy marches
                        westward.71 On Sunday morning, April 6, they were fifteen miles from 
                        Savannah
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    , and here General Nelson received Grant's first request for reinforcements.72 Letters from men of the Ninth Infantry describe their experiences as they
                    hurried to the scene of battle and their part in the severe fighting on Monday.
            
                    So they put us through about fifteen miles to Savannah by noon; here we stopped long enough to
                        cook dinner, and then we had to go it at a run for 10 or 11 miles to the ferry by sundown, and
                        by eight our Division—General Nelson's—was in line on the
                        battlefield; we received orders to move forward and take up an advanced position, which we did
                        at about 12 p.m.73
               
                    We reached the river opposite the battle-field just before dark; crossed over soon after on
                        steamers to join in the conflict. Our men under General Grant had given way; and at dark when
                        the firing ceased, prospects looked gloomy on our side. We drew up in line of battle, about one
                        half mile from the landing, and came to a parade rest;—stood there and sat down
                        occasionally during the night. Soon as day began to dawn we took up our march to confront our
                        enemy. Shortly the woods commenced ringing with the sound of cannon and musketry. The enemy fell
                        back to a strong position and the Ninth came to a halt

                    General Nelson, commander of the Fourth Division, stated in his report, "I refer the
                    general to the reports of the brigade commanders for the part each regiment took in the action,
                    reserving to myself only to mention that during the action I rode up and thanked the Ninth Indiana
                    Regiment for its gallantry."75 Later General Nelson presented the
                    regiment with a splendid flag to show his regard for their brave and gallant service.76 Colonel William B. Hazen, commander of the Nineteenth Brigade, reported, "It
                    is proper here to say that the Ninth Indiana Volunteers, which lost one officer and several men in
                    the morning's engagement, showed remarkable coolness and fortitude during the entire
                        time."77 Colonel Gideon C. Moody, colonel of the Ninth Indiana,
                    described how the regiment actively engaged the enemy throughout the day, was in several charges,
                    and engaged in a fire fight with the enemy for several hours.78

                    of the battle, when reprinted by town and village newspapers throughout the West, caused a pall of

                        the shock to the community was one never to be forgotten. The high tension of feeling, the
                            suppressed excitement and the awful suspense were oppressive, and it was days before the
                            parents and relatives of the boys in the fight knew the fate of these boys so engaged.83
                  
                    
            
            It was on April 14 that news concerning the men of Company I was received by villagers. Captain
                    Houghton had been wounded while leading a charge against a battery of enemy guns, and Corporal Jesse
                    Miller and Private Daniel Ungry were killed in the same charge. Eleven other men from the company
                    had been wounded in the battle. Houghton died about twelve hours later, and citizens were saddened
                    when they heard that his last words were, "Tell my wife that I

                        sorrow."84
            
            The next day citizens gathered at the town hall to decide how they could help their sick and wounded
                    men, and finally after much discussion definite plans were made. It was agreed that someone from the
                    village should be sent at once to 
                        Shiloh
                    , where he could ascertain what home folks could do for the men and while there arrange
                    to have the bodies of the 
                        Mishawaka
                     casualties sent home for burial. Two committees were formed: one to raise money for
                    medicines and supplies, and another to make arrangements to receive the bodies of the dead and to
                    make preparations for their burial in the village cemetery. Two hundred dollars were subscribed by
                    citizens, and George Milburn was chosen to visit the men at 
                        Shiloh
                    . Milburn left for 
                        Indianapolis
                     that night.85
            
            Milburn was a resourceful and energetic man, and he completed the task assigned by his fellow
                    townsmen. While away from the village, he kept home folks informed by letters, which were published
                    in the Enterprise, about his experiences and observations. He arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                     early Tuesday morning and found that a train carrying Indiana men wounded at 
                        Shiloh
                     would soon arrive from 
                        Terre Haute
                    .86 He talked with the 
                        Mishawaka
                     men who were on the train, and from them gathered more information concerning the
                    wounded. William Gilman, Amos Dayhuff, Peter Cottrell, and Peter Sternberry were on the train being
                    sent home. These men told him that Sherman Stebbins, Jonas Dressler, John Lunday, and William Giles

                            troops and did not cooperate with other states. Also, some generals claimed that the
                            interference of Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission was demoralizing to the service.

                    skull, had been sent to the government hospital at

                        Shiloh
                    , and a marker had been placed on his grave. The bodies of Miller and Ungry had been
                    buried in a mass grave, and there was nothing to distinguish their resting place.87
            
            Convinced that he could do nothing more for the wounded at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Milburn left for 
                        Evansville
                     at eleven o'clock the same day. He wrote two letters from this place, one on
                    April 16 and another the following day. By this time many of the wounded Indiana men, who had been
                    brought to 
                        Evansville
                     from the battlefield, had been transferred to hospitals in other Indiana towns, but the 
                        Mishawaka
                     men were too seriously injured to be moved.88 Milburn wrote after
                    he had visited them that he believed they were receiving good nursing and medical care. He also
                    informed home folks that additional doctors and nurses were not needed at this time but suggested
                    that the Ladies' Aid Society increase its efforts to gather needed supplies for the troops.

                     who had been at 
                        Shiloh
                     had told him that Houghton's body could not be shipped home at this time. He

            While at 
                        Evansville
                    , Milburn was unable to secure permission to visit the battlefield.90 Being a resourceful man, however, he went on to Paducah to visit the Forty-eighth Regiment,
                    and while there, with the assistance of Major DeWitt G. Rugg, secured the necessary pass.91 At 
                        Shiloh
                     he stayed several days with the 
                        Mishawaka
                     men, many of whom he found to be sick and discouraged. There was little that could be
                    done for them, but his visit and the knowledge that home folks were concerned about their welfare
                    did ease their homesickness and raise their morale. While at the battlefield, Milburn became ill
                    with diarrhea and soon after was forced to leave for home.92 On the return trip
                    he again visited the men at 
                        Paducah
                    , and after a short stay there returned to 
                        Mishawaka
                     on April 27, quite sick and very much exhausted from his travels.93

                     disappointments were forgotten, and there was an immediate rise
                    in spirit and morale at the prospect of active service. One volunteer described the excitement:
                        
                        Marching orders. All is excitement. The companies are cooking and packing. The boys are
                            cheering and singing. The 48th are in for the decisive battle which is to decide the contest

                    On April 27 the men left Paducah, never to return again during the war. At Pittsburg Landing
                    the regiment was placed in the First Brigade (Buford), Third Division (
                        Hamilton
                    ), of the Army of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , commanded by Major General John Pope.97

                     and before the impending battle at 
                        Corinth
                    , Governor Morton saw a need for additional surgeons, and he secured permission from the
                    War Department to send to each Indiana regiment in active service in 
                        Tennessee
                     two additional assistant surgeons.98 Morton at once selected
                    surgeons of good standing and dispatched them to the field with instructions to remain as long as
                    their services were required.99 Dr. William Butterworth and Henry Towle, a young
                    man who acted as his nurse, left 
                        Mishawaka
                     in response to this call from Governor Morton.100 They joined the

                     101 Dr. Butterworth and Henry Towle joined the Forty-eighth Indiana
                            Volunteers on May 9. Towle left for home on June 1, but Butter-worth remained with the
                            regiment until June 13, 1862. Judkins Diary, I, 44, 52.
               
                     army on Corinth, Dr. Butterworth and Towle had many
                    opportunities to visit their friends in the Ninth Regiment. Most of the men of the Ninth had
                    recovered from their terrible experiences at 
                        Shiloh
                     and were in good spirits, but some of the 
                        Mishawaka
                     boys were quite sick with dysentery. Dr. Butterworth tried to get permission to send
                    the sick men home, but he was unsuccessful, and they remained with the regiment throughout the
                    Corinth campaign.102
            
            Following the occupation of Corinth on May 30, General Halleck, believing that the proper strategy
                    was to control important railroads and occupy strategic cities, dispersed the large federal army
                    that had been concentrated during the Corinth campaign.103 The members of the
                    Ninth Regiment, veterans of several hard campaigns, went with General Buell's Army of the 
                        Ohio
                     in a drive towards Chattanooga, while the Forty-eighth Regiment, now with General W. S.
                    Rosecrans' Army of the 
                        Mississippi
                    , remained throughout the summer in Tishomingo County, 
                        Mississippi
                    , guarding the railroad center at 
                        Cornith
                    .104 Dr. Butterworth and Towle, their services no longer needed by
                    the army, returned to 
                        Mishawaka
                     in June.105
            
            The bloody fighting of the spring months had brought an abrupt change in the thinking of Mishawakans.

                            produced a serious effect on the health of the troops, and dysentery of a threatening type

                     mourned their dead, and to the best of their ability had cared
                    for the wounded; then, hiding their grief, villagers had resumed their ways of life. But the
                    fighting had taken a terrible toll, and never again throughout the war would home folks be as
                    optimistic about its outcome as they had been during the early months of the year. Before 
                        Shiloh
                    , problems caused by the war had been regarded as troublesome but temporary ones which
                    would be solved by the coming of peace; now these problems loomed larger and there was little hope
                    of quick solutions. Trying to fill the new regiments when men would not volunteer, collecting money
                    and supplies for the soldiers' families and the poor, combating the increase in drunkenness
                    and crime, and forestalling inflation were no longer temporary problems. The dead and wounded men,
                    casualties of the inconclusive fighting of the past months, had brought a grim realization that if
                    the war was to be won and the Union restored, continued hard work and sacrifice would be required
                    from all.
         
         
         
            An Indiana Democrat of Southern Origin Speaks for the Union, 1832
            
                    Edited by Chase C. Mooney
                    ∗
                
            In 1832 a number of people from different parts of the country wrote to Wilson Lumpkin, governor of 
                        Georgia
                     from 1831 to 1833, expressing concern over strained relations between the Empire State
                    of the South and the central government. In this correspondence was a letter from Tilghman Ashurst
                        Howard,1 1797–1844, a native of 
                        South Carolina
                    . After residence in 
                        North Carolina
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    , he had moved to 
                        Bloomington
                    , Indiana, in 1830. Within the next fourteen years he formed law partnerships with James
                    Whitcomb and Joseph A. Wright (both later governors of Indiana), moved to 
                        Rockville
                     shortly after his marriage in 1833, served as 
                        United States
                     district attorney and adjuster of Indian claims in Indiana, was a member of the board
                    of trustees of 
                        Wabash
                     College and of Indiana University. A Democrat, Howard won election to the 
                        United States
                     House of Representatives, was defeated by Samuel Bigger for the governorship, and
                    withdrew from a race for 
                        United States
                     senator when only two votes shy of the necessary majority. In 1844 President John Tyler

                        Howard received little formal education, but he was considered a learned man. His title of
                            "General" came from his appointment to 
                                Houston
                            's military staff.
                    
            
            
            The long-enduring Indian problem in 
                        Georgia
                    , creator of the incident which disturbed Howard, had almost reached its final solution
                    when the adopted Hoosier wrote his letter. Repeated frictions had arisen between 
                        Georgia
                     and the central government because the Georgians thought the 
                        United States
                     too slow in fulfilling the agreement of 1802 by which 
                        Georgia
                     ceded her western lands, the boundaries of the state were set, and the Indians were to
                    relinquish title to their lands in the state. Difficulties with the Creeks had not been entirely
                    resolved when the Cherokee problem became acute. In 1829 the boundaries of 
                        Gwinnett County
                     were extended to include the Cherokee who had set up their own
                    "independent" state. The 
                        United States
                     asserted its authority to handle relations with the tribe, but in December, 1830, the 
                        Georgia
                     legislature forbade anyone to enter the area without taking the oath of allegiance to
                    and securing a license from the state. A decision of the Supreme Court against the Cherokee chief
                    was followed by the arrest of a number of missionaries and gold diggers in the area in March, 1831.
                    Release on a technicality was followed by re-arrest in July, 1831, and quick conviction by the jury
                    of the 
                        Georgia
                     Superior Court, Western District. Judge Augustin Clayton's recommendation of
                    executive clemency—if the men would leave the area—was accepted by all but
                    missionaries Samuel A. Worcester and Elizur Butler. In

                            Georgia
                        , 1832, the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court held for the missionaries and declared the 
                        Georgia
                     law of jurisdiction unconstitutional. The mandate to the superior court (there was no
                    supreme court in 
                        Georgia
                     until 1845) was not even recorded. President Jackson was not favorably inclined toward
                    the decision; the situation in the southeastern states was "brittle" because of
                    the nullification controversy; the missionaries decided they had carried their martyrdom far enough
                    and accepted a pardon in early 1833.3

                    preserve that Union.

                        Sir,
                        I have, in common with thousands of my fellow citizens, looked forward to the present
                                    state of things, in our widely extended Republick, as being fraught with the most
                                    dangerous consequences to the liberty of our people, the greatest guarrantee [sic] whereof is the Union of the States. The ordinance of the
                                    Nullifiers of South-Carolina, leaves it no longer a matter of doubt or speculation
                                    as to the course she is ultimately to take, upon the all absorbing question of the
                                        Tariff. Under such an exciting occasion, it is necessary that
                                    the friends of Union, and mutual concession, should remove every obstacle to a
                                    successful [yet bloodless) [sic] resistence [sic] of the destructive principle of Nullification. It cannot have escaped
                                    your notice, that, the uncompromising Opposition to the present administration,
                                    attempt, in their efforts to clog the wheels of the government, to identify 
                                        Georgia
                                     with South-Carolina—differing only as to the facts, and not
                                    in principle. This being true, and the occasion having passed away, when it was
                                    esteemed by a certain party4 necessary to keep up an incitement
                                    in relation to the Indian question, may I not, as an american citizen, feeling a
                                    deep interest in the perpetuity of our institutions, ask your Excellency, whether a
                                    pardon extended to the missionaries would not remove a difficulty, which in the
                                    estimation of many will be a clog upon the course of the executive in resisting the
                                    efforts of S. Carolina to abolish the Tariff laws? That the president entertains
                                    sentiments favorable to 
                                        Georgia
                                     is conceded by all, and that 
                              
                                 4 It is not certain whether this is a reference to
                                            George M. Troup, governor from 1823 to 1827, or to John Forsyth, governor
                                            from 1827 to 1829. Lumpkin had supported their position, but as chief
                                            executive he seemed to have no desire to add to the troubles with the
                                            central government.
                           
                                     he will act upon the principles already laid
                                    down by him, in his Indian policy cannot be doubted, and therefore this single act
                                    of clemency, will, as it seems to me, in no wise prejudice your state upon the
                                    "main question."— I do not speak upon this subject,
                                    without sympathizing with the South, and desiring a modification of those laws,
                                    which operate oppressively upon her citizens. I am a native of South-Carolina, and
                                    that state contains the bones of my mother—and my feelings are averse to
                                    treading her soil with arms in my hands— Nothing but duty would compel me
                                    to such a course—and I gladly afford my humble efforts, in every mode
                                    that I am led to believe will conduce to the restoration of harmony.— The
                                    position of the president between the Supreme Court of the U. S. and 
                                        Georgia
                                     is an embarrassing one—too much so for the occasion. Will
                                    his friends force him to incur the fearful responsibility on either side? Is the
                                    Union of no more value than to be put to hazard on such slight grounds? May I
                                    entreat you sir, as one who is southern in his origin &
                                    feelings—one who desires an equal participation in the blessings of
                                    liberty—one who has a sacred regard for State Rights, in the highest
                                    legitimate use of the terms, to look at the Crisis which approaches—and
                                    consider well, whether an act of clemency towards the misguided persons whose
                                    imprison[m]ent by your state authorities, has caused so much excitement, would not
                                    be a measure productive of much good, and avoiding at the same time an alternative
                                    dangerous to all parties.
                        
                                    With high esteem for your Character,
                                    I am, Respectfully,

            Louis Jolliet received minor orders in the Society of Jesus in 1662 at the age of seventeen as a
                    protégé of Bishop Laval. He became a trader to the Indians, but continued to
                    serve the church as organist of the Cathedral of Notre Dame at 
                        Quebec
                     while also serving his government as an explorer and hydrographer. When Intendant Talon
                    and Governor Frontenac wished to expedite the plans of Louis XIV's minister Colbert for an
                    expanded colonial empire, they selected Jolliet to secure authoritative information of the country
                    beyond the Great Lakes, from which vague and contradictory rumors had come to Lalemont, Menard,
                    Allouez, Dablon, and Marquette of a River of the West, of the chimerical Northwest Passage, and of a
                    River of the South. Jolliet combined reliability and loyalty with the necessary technical skills and
                    experience with wilderness life. His early Jesuit training and friendships in that aggressive order
                    made his leadership acceptable to the church, while his lay position ensured the government
                    paramount control of the expedition.
            The expedition descended the Mississippi River in 1673 until it was certain the
                    waters flowed into the Gulf of Mexico, where Spanish hospitality was uncertain. Marquette returned
                    to the St. Xavier mission on Green Bay, while Jolliet spent the winter expanding his journals and
                    maps at the trading post at Sault Ste. Marie. His original documents and his companions were lost in
                    the Ottawa River rapids near Montreal as he returned in the spring of 1674. The
                    copies he had left at Sault Ste. Marie were destroyed when the post was burned after his departure
                    for Montreal. Jolliet gave an oral report to Frontenac and prepared a map and report from memory,
                    but historians have relied on the journal, supposedly Marquette's, which Dablon constructed
                    from Marquette's report to his superior and from Jolliet's reconstructed account.
                    The loss of Jolliet's original journal has resulted in conflicting views on the relative
                    importance of the leadership of Marquette and Jolliet, the possible dominance of Jesuit influence
                    and plans for the future development of the western lands, and the rivalry between that religious
                    order and the colonial authorities.
            Jolliet later explored the English penetration of the James Bay area, established a small Indian
                    trading empire based at his Anticosta Island grant from the government, and began to explore and map
                    the southern coast of Labrador. He was commissioned royal hydrographer of the colony, and he taught
                    classes in map making. As he returned to his Anticosta post in the spring of 1700 his ship was lost
                    in the St. Lawrence.
            The author has constructed a rapidly moving tale from the authenticated facts of Jolliet's
                    life. She has made excellent use of the sources, but obviously prefers the Jesuit emphasis of Dablon
                    and Delanglez to the research conclusions of Steck. Miss Eifert has no  good words for La Salle, who "didn't even know how to
                    follow a compass" (p. 65), and only slight praise for Governor Frontenac. There is
                    occasional recourse to those all-inclusive words of the historical novelist:
                    "probably," "may have," and "must have," with
                    which gaps between fragments of historical evidence are bridged; but the teacher who uses this book
                    as a proper device in junior or senior high school for the development of historical understanding
                    can congratulate Miss Eifert on using these words sparingly and wisely. He can also congratulate her
                    on the fact that the personality of Louis Jolliet emerges with such attractive qualities. Miss
                    Eifert reanimates the intimacies of the Jolliet family, and the result is a pleasing book which
                    should be a useful addition to the public or school library.

               The Jonathan Hale Farm is a delightful and informative volume to read. Opening
                    chapters tell of 
                        Connecticut
                    's ties with the Western Reserve of northeastern 
                        Ohio
                     and of early years in this area. The main emphasis, however, concerns the life and
                    labors of the Jonathan Hale family and their neighbors in the Cuyahoga Valley
                    south of 
                        Cleveland
                     following Hale's arrival from 
                        Connecticut
                     in 1810 until his death in 1854. Contemporary source material is used to describe
                    difficulties and perils encountered by the Hales and others in making the slow and laborious trip
                    from 
                        Connecticut
                    , how they and their neighbors established themselves in the fertile Cuyahoga
                        Valley, their slow and then more rapid improvement of living conditions, the impact
                    of improved transportation, the evolution from barter to an economy based mainly on money, the
                    beginnings of culture, and the almost endless toil and labor required of early settlers.
            The Hales and other pioneers "developed" the Cuyahoga Valley
                    from its "underdeveloped" status into an area with a productive economy in a
                    remarkably short period of time. If we had a number of similar histories of additional families who
                    settled in the pioneer Midwest, our knowledge and understanding of pioneer life and what pioneering
                    involved would be significantly increased. Such studies would help test and evaluate ideas and
                    generalizations regarding early economic development, the genesis of culture, rural versus urban
                    influences, the impact of the frontier on the life of the pioneers, the relationship between
                    improvement in transportation facilities and general economic progress, and so on. The
                        Jonathan Hale Farm, for instance, suggests that economic development came from both private
                    and governmental efforts, that the frontier in various subtle ways made the Hales something more
                    than merely transplanted Yankees, and that development of transportation facilities was basic to
                    economic progress, with its resulting cultural life.
            
            
               The Jonathan Hale Farm supports the view that succeeding generations owe much to
                    their pioneer heritage. Moreover, it clearly indicates that the Hales and their neighbors were
                    generally extremely eager to escape the "privations" and
                    "hardships" of pioneer life. The death of the first Mrs. Hale in 1829, many years
                    in advance of her husband's demise, vividly illustrates that pioneer life was even more
                    harsh and costly to women than to men. There is tragedy in the fact that the first Mrs. Hale lived
                    only a few years in the new brick house, completed in the twenties. Fortunately, the Jonathan Hale
                    Farm is now the Jonathan Hale Homestead, restored by the Western Reserve Historical Society and
                    recognized by Congress as a national historical site. Supported by a bequest from a
                    great-granddaughter of Jonathan Hale, Miss Clara Belle Ritchie, the homestead is now operated as a
                    museum to illustrate life in the Cuyahoga Valley in pioneer days. Such museums
                    are essential as an important means of explaining and interpreting the continuing debt of
                    midwesterners to their pioneer heritage.

               Lincoln as a Lawyer. By John P. Frank. (
                        Urbana
                    : University of 
                        Illinois
                     Press, 1961. Pp. x, 190. Appendix, index. $4.75.)
            Lincoln has been examined in as many different ways as any human being who ever lived. His life and
                    all known facts surrounding it have been scrutinized. He has been the subject and, in some
                    instances, the victim of analysis and hypothesis. This volume has the merit of setting itself a
                    modest goal, and the author has the discipline to devote himself to the achievement of that goal.
                    Occasionally, as is true in so many works about Lincoln, the mystery of his greatness proves
                    overwhelming. The writer is tempted beyond resistance to write about the intriguing unknowns of
                    Lincoln in ways far afield from particular and announced aims. When Frank does this (and he has
                    resisted the temptation better than most), his writing takes on the aspect of a wry smile. It is as
                    though he were telling us that he is aware that he is leaving the path that he has set out for
                    himself because he cannot restrain his pen.
            A great man happened to be a lawyer. In what ways did his profession affect his life? In what ways
                    did it affect his thought and his decisions?
            There is first described the legal practice in which Lincoln participated. From the nature of his
                    practice, from the nature of the cases he handled, from the techniques which he used in handling the
                    cases, the author extrapolates certain generalities about the mind of the practitioner. Having
                    studied the practice and studied the mental set of the practitioner, the author moves boldly into
                    Lincoln's public life both before and during his presidency. Matters of common knowledge
                    among Lincoln lovers are examined from the peculiar point of view of the lawyer studying the lawyer.
                    The Lincoln-Douglas debates, the Emancipation Proclamation, and many other speeches and papers of
                    Lincoln are treated as cases prepared by a lawyer and shaped by his experience during twenty-five
                    years at the bar.
            
            Many very interesting similarities between Lincoln handling a case and Lincoln handling a country are
                    pointed out. Lincoln's appeal to a jury or a judge becomes Lincoln's appeal to a
                    cabinet member or the country. For those having close acquaintance with the problems and techniques
                    of lawyers, this volume presents a unique series of analyses by way of analogy. The author tries to
                    show that Lincoln, who began his practice of law without formal training and with very little
                    training of any kind, grew in stature to become a man highly skilled in legal techniques and that he
                    embarked upon the affairs of the presidency with equally negligible preparation, but grew in skill
                    as a statesman in the same way he had grown in the skills of his profession.
            The appeal of the book is by its very nature limited, but even those without legal training or
                    special interest in law will find that the assembled facts and the reasoning presented add much to
                    their understanding of Lincoln.

               Politics and the Crisis of 1860. By William E. Baringer et al. Edited by Norman

                     Press, 1961. Pp. xii, 156. Readings, index. $3.00.)
            This volume consists of five essays presented originally in 1960 at a Civil War conference at 
                        Gettysburg
                     College. The common theme is slavery's impact on American politics. Although
                    the five authors agree that slavery was at the heart of the sectional conflict and that emotionalism
                    was partly responsible for the crisis of 1860, they differ significantly in explaining how and why
                    the crisis came.
            Three focus attention on events that transpired in 1860. Robert W. Johannsen argues powerfully that
                    the breakup of the Democratic party at 
                        Charleston
                    , which resulted from uncompromisable differences over the territorial question, sealed
                    the fate of the Union. Don E. Fehrenbacher and William E. Baringer turn to the Republican camp to
                    disclose the crisis. According to Fehrenbacher the choice of candidate and platform at the Wigwam in 
                        Chicago
                     was unacceptable to southerners because it portended the doom of their society. Thus
                    they left the Union "to hold back a future that appeared to have no place for
                    them" (p. 60). Baringer attributes the crisis to fiery campaign statements of Republican
                    editors and politicians; their words generated such anger and fear in the South that after
                    Lincoln's election—which in fact constituted nothing revolutionary in the
                    political and constitutional system—moderates failed to placate the southern mind, and
                    secessionist leaders, exploiting Republican threats, led their states out of the Union.
            Norman A. Graebner surveys the antislavery movement in American politics from 1840–1860
                    and advances a twofold explanation of the crisis of 1860. Southern secessionists pursued objectives
                    that could not be achieved within the political system, while northern antislavery leaders pursued
                    objectives that could not be achieved under the Constitution. The second half of this interpretation
                    challenges Fehrenbacher's argument, which cannot be easily discounted. Graebner himself
                    insists  that Republicans could not abandon their antislavery
                    program without destroying their political machine (p. 31). Why, in time, they could not have
                    implemented such a program is not adequately explained. Indeed, for antislavery leaders perhaps
                    Lincoln's election was a momentous step toward achieving in the political arena, under the
                    Constitution, the objectives they sought.
            Avery Craven stresses the disruptive pressures of inflammatory antislavery pronouncements and of
                    Republican determination to establish "the Modern World of Nationalism,
                    the Industrial Revolution, and Freedom" (p. 134). His stylistic, well-balanced essay
                    reflects mature thought, considered judgment, and compassionate understanding.
            The selective bibliography includes many of the best works on Civil War causation. In the future
                    similar bibliographies should contain this volume.

            The history of publishing and the publishing trade in the American Middle West offers a large and
                    heretofore little explored area for scholars interested in American cultural studies. With the
                    exception of scattered articles as well as space devoted to publishing in the Middle West in Ralph
                    L. Rusk's The Literature of the Middle Western Frontier (1925), W. H.
                    Venable's Beginnings of Literary Culture in the Ohio
                        Valley
                (1891), and R. Carlyle Buley's Old Northwest
                    (1950), however, almost nothing of a reliable nature has been written on this large area. Walter
                    Sutton's new book must stand as a "first" as an authoritative attempt to
                    review in thorough manner the history and function of the book trade centering in an important
                    middle western city during the nineteenth century.
            Professor Sutton's intention in writing his book may be seen in the Preface. Recognizing
                    there the need to tell the story of the careers of book publishers and sellers and of the impact of
                    their work upon the people who read their printed material, he sets about the "task of
                    rescuing these figures from obscurity and of retracing their activities … " (p.
                    vii). His retracing carries the reader through the development of 
                        Cincinnati
                    's "regional publishing industry from its pioneer beginnings, through
                    its periods of greatest importance, into its decline in the years following the Civil War"
                    (p. viii). In achieving that avowed task, the book chronicles, specifically, the forces leading to
                    and the development of the pioneer publishing industry, tells the story of the major publishing
                    houses, such as the houses of James, of Derby, and of Clarke, and, finally, describes the shift of
                    the book industry away from 
                        Cincinnati
                     in the late nineteenth century and the reasons for that shift. Throughout, the
                    recounting is well supported in footnotes referring the reader to the available records of the
                    period:  newspaper files, editions of books actually printed
                    during the era, and historical, biographical, and statistical documents.
            One of the most important features of the work is a directory of publishers, booksellers and
                    auctioneers, bookbinders, music publishers and dealers, type founders, stereotypers, paper
                    manufacturers and dealers, wood and copperplate and steel-plate engravers, and lithographers, all in
                    an alphabetical listing which occurs at the back of the book. Such a directory will be of real value
                    as a handy guide to students and scholars of the publishing industry in 
                        Cincinnati
                    .
            Because the purpose of Professor Button's work is so extensive and since his intention is to
                    deal essentially with the "book-trade," it has undoubtedly been necessary for him
                    to pass lightly over such important publications as the literary and religious periodicals of the
                    time. It would seem, nonetheless, that such a study as this ought to have had space dedicated,
                    particularly in the chapter entitled "Early Publications," to such important
                    periodicals as Flint's Western Review and Clarke's Western Messenger, that organ of the Unitarians which brought to the Middle West in the
                    late 1830's some of the most "transcendental" thinking of 
                        New England
                     as well as poems by Emerson, Keats, and the minor poet Jones Very. Professor Sutton has
                    little more than mentioned the Western Review; and, if he has done the same for
                    the Western Messenger, this reader is not aware of the fact. Another limitation
                    occurs, also, in the inadequate index to the book. Of twenty names chosen at random, fourteen were
                    indexed.
            If we grant this minor limitation, as well as the practical omission of important literary and
                    religious periodicals from the study, we have left in The Western Book Trade an
                    accurate coverage of material, a vivid description of the growth and decline of an industry, an
                    excellent listing of publishers and their associates, and, best of all, an objective and intelligent
                    first achievement in an important area which has gone almost untouched by scholars.

                        Indianapolis
                     in 1869, as Heinrich Schliemann saw it, was a commercially thriving town of forty
                    thousand, well-built, with streets as much as 120 feet wide, and "crossed by twelve
                    railroads." But he found it no cultural center. "The culture of the people is
                    merely superficial, and nobody understands me" (p. 36). The blue laws
                    were a nuisance; no good wine or beer were to be found. "Here in Indiana classical
                    education does not exist at all" (p. 26). But 
                        Indianapolis
                     was not quite the nadir, even in Indiana. 
                        Fort Wayne
                     he found "an exceedingly tedious place, for if there is very little to occupy
                    the mind in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , there is literally nothing at 
                        Fort Wayne
                    " (p. 20). His comments on the general assembly strike a familiar note:
                    "The representatives behave much like school-boys, all chewing and continually spitting;
                    many holding their legs continually on their desks before them and all putting the laws in the most
                    summary and wreckless  [sic] way….
                    I am glad to have got an insight into the doings of these people's legislative assemblies
                    which present Democracy in all its roughness and nudity, with all its party spirit…. I
                    often saw them throwing paper-balls at each other and even at the speaker." (pp.
                    18–19).
            But Dr. Schliemann was not in 
                        Indianapolis
                     for cultural purposes. He had come to the 
                        United States
                     in March of 1869 to acquire American citizenship, which he thought would be helpful in
                    his archaeological dealings with the Greek and Turkish governments. He went to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to get, as quickly and quietly as possible, a divorce from a Russian wife from whom he
                    had been separated for years. Indiana, he had discovered, had the most notoriously lax divorce laws
                    in the country. The three months he spent in the city were exactly the time required to establish
                    residence and get his decree.
            The present slim and handsome volume gives the fullest account to date of this little-known episode
                    in the life of the father of modern archaeology. Mr. Lilly has written two brief narrative chapters
                    on the life of Schliemann before and after his stay in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but the heart of the book consists of excerpts from his diary from March 26 to July
                    18, 1869, and of selections from the ninety-seven letters he wrote to various correspondents from 
                        Indianapolis
                     or, later, to people in that city. These letters in four languages (translated in the
                    present volume) to correspondents in eight countries give a vivid impression of the range of
                    interests of this eccentric genius. In addition to the observations on American life, we find the
                    preliminary correspondence that led to his selecting his second, Greek, wife from photographs sent
                    him from 
                        Athens
                    , correspondence relative to arrangements for the expedition that was to discover 
                        Troy
                    , an essay on The Arabian Nights, a letter reproving his brother for
                    gambling at cards, a paper read before the Convention of American Philologians, schemes for reaching
                    the North Pole, and letters pertaining to a great many business transactions.
            Mr. Lilly's little book gives us some welcome additions to the portrait of Heinrich
                    Schliemann, as well as penetrating and amusing views of ourselves (or our ancestors) through the
                    eyes of an intelligent foreign visitor. The research in the Schliemann Archives in the Gennadius
                    Library, 
                        Athens
                    , where almost all this material is housed, was done by Mr. Peter-Nick I. Vavalis, of 
                        Athens
                    . Mr. Lilly and the Indiana Historical Society are to be congratulated on a very
                    attractive example of bookmaking, practically free from errors.

               The Hoosier Community at War. By Max Parvin Cavnes. Indiana

            A war's impact on local communities far from actual combat is a proper subject for study.
                    Cavnes has made a real contribution to the series, Indiana in World War II. He has
                    not attempted to describe every  phase of Hoosier community life
                    in the war years but has selected a dozen topics such as boom towns, education, public health, care
                    for servicemen, housing, and race relations, since these are related to the war and its effects on
                    Indiana.
            Most Hoosiers were poorly prepared to cope with the new situations as they arose. Sometimes they were
                    slow even to recognize a problem, as is well illustrated by the questions of housing, sanitation,
                    entertainment of Negro servicemen, and the appearance of teenage prostitutes. In other cases, while
                    aware of the problem, community leaders revealed ineptness, fear, or downright unwillingness to act,
                    as in the conduct of some recreational centers, organized vice in some cities, and employment of
                    Negro workers in the larger communities.
            The author is to be commended for his willingness to reveal Hoosier shortcomings as well as their
                    successes. It appears that in too many cases there was a desire to wait out the war; in a few cases
                    there was great reluctance to accept needed help from the outside; at times there were indications
                    of a desire to use war as an excuse for retrogression, as in the attitude of many toward child labor
                    legislation.
            Not all activities in Indiana during the war reflected unwillingness to act decisively. Some cities
                    and towns made remarkable progress in their handling of difficult situations. Teachers and school
                    administrators adjusted quickly and efficiently. Perhaps the greatest change in the field of
                    education was that in the colleges and universities. Young men and women in uniform, in virtually
                    all of the schools, were trained under programs set up by the armed forces; in most cases there was
                    a radical revision of curricula and a reduction in the time required for completion of studies.
            Much space is devoted to state and local care of the aged, the mentally ill, and inmates of
                    correctional institutions. Reluctantly, the reviewer finds that this part of the volume, though well
                    done, is related to the war in but one important respect: the distressing shortage of qualified
                    personnel arising out of the demands for men in the armed forces and in industry. The aged posed a
                    problem before the war. They became more numerous during the war, but war did not greatly affect the
                    problem of an aging population. Nor did war affect mental illness (among civilians) to any great
                    degree. War did influence the crime rate, as is well brought out in the excellent discussion of
                    juvenile delinquency. But, except as noted in regard to personnel, the Hoosier community at war was
                    little different from the same community in peacetime as far as penal institutions, the aged, and
                    the mentally ill were concerned.
            Some very important wartime activities are not described. Sacrifices on the part of rationing boards,
                    support of bond drives by Indiana cities, hardships imposed on manufacturers not engaged in
                    producing war materials—these are omitted. But the strong points of this book far
                    outweigh its short-comings. It is exceedingly well documented. Almost without exception, the sources
                    are primary; copious references are made to newspapers, correspondence, and official reports.
            As an historical record and as a blueprint for those Hoosiers who might wish to avoid making certain
                    mistakes in some future conflict, this book merits careful study.

               The Mennonites in Indiana and 
                            Michigan
                        . By John Christian Wenger. Studies in Anabaptist and Mennonite
                        History, Number 10. (Scottsdale, Pa.: Herald Press, 1961. Pp. xv, 470. Illustrations,
                    appendices, bibliography, index. $7.95.)
            Professor Wenger, of the 
                        Goshen
                     College Biblical Seminary, 
                        Goshen
                    , Indiana, has written a comprehensive and sympathetic history of the Mennonites and
                    related groups in Indiana and 
                        Michigan
                    . He reviews European Anabaptist origins of the Mennonites and Amish and notes the
                    beginnings of these groups in the 
                        United States
                     during the colonial era. Most of the Mennonites and Amish settled in eastern 
                        Pennsylvania
                     during the half-century or so preceding the American Revolution. Attention is given to
                    leading Mennonite and Amish doctrines and teachings as well as to questions and personalities which
                    have at time divided these groups. Much the greater portion of the book, however, is devoted to
                    concise historical sketches of Mennonite and Amish congregations in Indiana and 
                        Michigan
                    . Considerable space is also given to sketches about ordained leaders.
            From eastern 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , Mennonite and Amish settlers soon emigrated to western 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , the states of 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    , and to the Canadian province of 
                        Ontario
                    . The initial settlements in Indiana began in the northeastern portion of the state in
                    the 1830's and 1840's. Most of the Mennonites and Amish who came to Indiana and 
                        Michigan
                     had lived in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , or 
                        Ontario
                    , though a few arrived directly from Europe. The number of Mennonite and Amish settlers
                    in Indiana grew slowly, with a total of perhaps 750 members in 1860. Their Indiana total appears to
                    have been about 17,500 as of 1960. The totals for 
                        Michigan
                     have always been much less than for Indiana. Indiana Amish and Mennonites have lived
                    mainly in the northeastern part of the state, especially in 
                        Elkhart
                     and 
                        Lagrange
                     counties.
            Family and congregational ties have generally been strong among Mennonites and Amish. On the other
                    hand, they have cooperated to give aid to schools, missionary and service projects, historical work
                    and publication ventures, relief efforts within and without their communion, youth work, and in
                    other ways. In fact, their efforts in such areas have been considerable in view of their limited
                    number. Such persons have often been conscientious objectors in time of war—from Civil
                    War days through World Wars I and II—but their service to their fellow men even amid
                    derision and persecution is perhaps less well understood.
            The reviewer found certain difficulties in reading this volume. First, it is hard to determine and
                    follow the main threads or developments within Mennonite-Amish elements—details obscure
                    the essential and general developments. Second, relationships between various Amish and Mennonite
                    groups are hard to follow, making it difficult to picture and understand these elements as a whole.
            Professor Wenger's volume is based on long-time research and intimate knowledge of Mennonite
                    and Amish origins. He gives his major emphasis to persons and groups associated with the "Indiana-
                        Michigan
                     Mennonite Conference." Although the sources used are not usually precisely
                    pinpointed, they are substantial, and Wenger has apparently 
                    attempted to be accurate. He makes clear, however, that part of his information is approximate or
                    even "conjectural" (see p. 437). His history is obviously written in part to make
                    Mennonites and Amish more aware of as well as proud of their history and heritage.

            Professor Quarles, of Morgan State College, is one of those scholars in the field of Negro
                    historiography who is doing much to strengthen its foundations against perhaps understandable
                    tendencies toward self-serving formulations. The present writer, for example, has an interesting
                    pamphlet by a Negro slave defending slavery, but no plans for discussing it in print. Who would wish
                    to print it? Professor Quarles is alert to the need for objectivity and follows commendable
                    historical criteria. He identifies no person as a Negro on circumstantial evidence; only those
                    explicitly termed Negroes are so regarded. He does not seek materials necessarily displaying Negroes
                    in admirable situations. He has no occasion to note Negroes in ignominious circumstances, possibly
                    because their circumstances in the colonies were ignominious; but he freely
                    records their activities as predators, to be sure, largely under command of white Loyalists or
                    rebels.
            Indeed, one of this work's major themes is that Negroes served as freely with revolutionists
                    as with Loyalists. Their condition being what it was, their goal was less colonial victory than
                    whatever would augment their chances for freedom. They named themselves Liberty,
                        Freedom, and Free. But though Crispus Attucks was immortalized by the 
                        Boston
                     Massacre, and Negroes served at 
                        Lexington
                     and Concord, their subsequent revolutionary careers were more complex than they were
                    during these two events.
            Patriots early adopted a policy of excluding Negroes from military ranks, especially in the South,
                    where their effect on slave morale was feared. Hence, Negroes responded to 
                        Virginia
                    's Royalist governor, Lord Dunmore, who sought to regiment them against their
                    masters. They served at Great Bridge, where Dunmore was defeated. Increasingly, revolutionary
                    leaders faced the fact that they needed the help of Negroes. Many Negroes served in northern forces:
                    an entire regiment at the Battle of 
                        Rhode Island
                    , though this is the one such unit identified. Hundreds of Negroes from Santo Domingo
                    participated in the unsuccessful siege of Savannah in 1779. Negroes were widely used as laborers, as
                    servants, as spies, informers, and notably as seamen and pilots. An interesting tale is their use in
                    connection with the system of substitutes for military service. A somewhat even less inspiring use
                    was made of Negroes as a supplement to land bounties for enlisted men. Negroes themselves were, in
                    the North, manumitted in exchange for military service, and the record of their cheerfulness and
                    desire to prove their title to regard is consistent. They served in all similar  capacities with the British, especially in the South with its large
                    Negro population. Professor Quarles holds firmly to the record, but permits himself a touch of irony
                    in citing British General Alexander Leslie as thinking the Negroes might perform "a last
                    service" in their often fatal sicknesses: "About 700 Negroes are come down
                        the River in the Small Pox. I shall distribute them about the Rebell
                    Plantations" (p. 142).
            The negotiations respecting Negroes following Yorktown casts an odd light on the libertarian
                    sentiments ordinarily associated with the event, though by and large Negroes gained by the
                    Revolution. The dispersal of Negroes to 
                        Canada
                    , 
                        East Florida
                    , the Caribbean countries, and Africa makes an interesting cosmopolitan tale. Professor
                    Quarles's thorough research and judicious handling of details adds much to previous
                    accounts of the subject. A critical bibliography would have been appreciated.

            Both The Twilight of Federalism and The Antifederalists challenge
                    widely held interpretations of key developments in the early national period of American history. As
                    the authors of these studies construct the history of the period, the Antifederalists in the late
                    1780's and the Federalists in the 1820's were fighting rear guard actions in
                    defense of what each conceived to be a benign political and social order. If Professor Main is
                    correct in assessing the Antifederalist platform as essentially democratic, it was this dynamic
                    element in the lost cause of 1788 that persisted through to victory over the champions of an ordered
                    society, organic in conception—the Federalists as Professor Livermore portrays them.
                    Strong arguments for the traditional aristocratic-democratic polarity of the period are presented.
            Livermore begins with the question: What became of the Federalists after the War of 1812? Were they
                    simply absorbed into the latter-day Jeffersonian party of the Bank, the navy, and protectionism?
                    Were they simply cast into oblivion only to reform under the National Republican and Whig banners?
                    Neither view is sustained. The Federalists, this study shows, continued to be a potent force in
                    American politics from 1815 to 1830, their quest for power a primary cause of the breakup of the
                    Republican party during Adams's administration and their support a major source of
                    Jacksonian strength.
            What may appear to be an orthodox political history is in reality a remarkably able synthesis of
                    social and political history. Leaning heavily upon his construction of the Federalist weltanschauung—their  deep suspicion of the
                    people's ability to rule themselves, their nostalgic longing to return to an organic social
                    order, and their death instinct—Professor Livermore pictures the struggle between
                    Federalists and Jeffersonians in terms pregnant with meaning for our own troubled society. The
                    underlying cause of Federalist failure, he believes, was a revolution in social thought which took
                    place between 1775 and 1825, the deep penetration of the Jeffersonian creed of individualism and an
                    atomistic society which ultimately replaced the concept of an ordered society which the Federalists
                    had tried to build on colonial foundations.
            Because of their talents, wealth, and prestige, however, the Federalists of 
                        New England
                     and the middle states continued to appeal to large blocs of voters. The Federalists
                    were too disorganized to offer battle in national elections, but their very unwillingness to
                    disappear on the level of state politics confronted the feuding factions of the Democratic party
                    with Hobson's choice: to embrace Federalist support after the Hartford Convention was
                    repeatedly shown to be disastrous; yet not to encourage their support was to leave rivals free to
                    win in combination with them. The result was that in the deceitful maneuvering of the election of
                    1824 Federalists were courted vigorously by Crawford as well as Calhoun, by Jackson as well as
                    Adams. That Van Buren and company were able to lure more Federalists into Old Hickory's
                    camp by 1828 than Adams' managers reveals both the meaninglessness of shibboleths and the
                    manipulative skills of the Jacksonians, skills lacked by both Adams men and the Federalists
                    themselves in astonishing degree. As in the 1790's, so in the 1820's, the
                    Federalists found themselves at the mercy of others because of their contempt for the finer arts of
                    political organizing. Jacksonians held out appointments, and scores of Federalist leaders grasped at
                    the fruits which both 
                        Monroe
                     and Adams, despite appearances to the contrary, failed to deliver. The war on the Bank
                    laid foundations for a new two-party system, but a surprising number of Federalists found the
                    Jacksonian household welcome shelter.
            Professor Main's long-awaited study of the Confederation period also reveals that the price
                    of poor coordination is defeat. The Antifederalists failed because of the superior élan and organization of their opponents. With their failure in 1788, Main
                    concludes, the true federalism established under the Articles and the state governments of the
                    Revolutionary era was overthrown. The Antifederalists were outwitted and outmaneuvered, leaders
                    truly representative of the mass of Antifederalists were not elected to the 
                        Philadelphia
                     Convention or to the state conventions, and the result was, in the author's
                    view, a defeat for democracy. By and large, the victorious Federalists were, as Beard insisted, men
                    of opulence, large property holders in contrast to the great majority of Antifederalists. It is also
                    highly significant, Professor Main points out, that Federalist spokesmen by contrast were men of
                    superior education. With all the refinements and research in depth that mark this study in
                    comparison with Beard's primitive analysis, Professor Main reaches conclusions not markedly
                    different on large issues. The division on adoption of the Constitution was not, however, between
                    personalty and realty interests, but between sections having access to navigation and outside
                    commerce and those that were  isolated and, to a great degree,
                    self-sufficient agrarian areas. Thus Orin G. Libby and Beard are, in this study, shown to be closer
                    to the truth about the overthrow of the Articles than such revisionists as Robert Brown and Forrest
                    McDonald.
            This is certain to be an explosive book, not only for its substantial agreement with the Beardian
                    diagnosis, but also because the author believes Progressive historians to have been right in
                    regarding class conflict as an essential feature of the history of the period. It becomes
                    increasingly apparent that consensus, if it is ever to be found, will rest largely upon some more
                    satisfactory definition of "class" than the economic orientation gives us. May the
                    insights of social history such as those used by Livermore not be of use in this arena also?
            That Professor Main is correct in maintaining that the Antifederalists were far more friendly to
                    popular checks upon government than the Federalists and that more poor men belonged on the
                    losers' side than on the winners' side may be granted without conceding that the
                    contending forces were classes in any sense acceptable to contemporary thought. Whether
                    Main's socio-geographic alignments will be accepted by experts in what is now an historical
                    problem of labyrinthic complexity remains to be seen. To this reviewer they are convincingly
                    constructed in this substantial, carefully documented, but highly controversial work.

               Cavalier and Yankee: The Old South and American National Character. By William
                    R. Taylor. (

                    : George Braziller, Inc., 1961. Pp. 384. Notes, index. $6.00.)
            By the time of the Civil War, says Professor Taylor, Americans had come to look upon themselves as
                    constituting two distinct civilizations with different historical and racial origins. The
                    author's purpose is to discover "what social problems produced the need for this
                    kind of historical rationalization, … what kind of men and women contributed to its
                    growth and dissemination—what sort of mentality, in other words, created this legendary
                    past and this fictional sociology, and what sort of needs it satisfied" (p. 16). Taylor
                    undertook this study because of his conviction that the belief in separate cultures was an important
                    cause of the Civil War.
            The author points out that Americans of the ante bellum period were intensely introspective, obsessed
                    with identifying and examining their national character. As this character—or rather,
                    characters—emerged, it proved to have disturbing flaws. The North did not like the image
                    it projected: the Yankee sharper, the product of a "grasping, soulless world of
                    business." So the North turned to the southern planter in an effort to find those desirable
                    qualities that the Yankee lacked. It also created a "Transcendent Yankee," who,
                    while superficially conforming to the unpleasant stereotype, turned out to be a noble, selfless,
                    nonmaterialistic being.
            There were many other tensions that elicited literary solutions. For example, both northerners and
                    southerners were concerned about  the danger to the family posed
                    by the feminist movement and by the extreme social mobility of the times. A major problem in the
                    older southern states was economic decline caused by soil exhaustion and competition from rich new
                    lands to the west. The plantation legend was used in an effort to resolve both problems. Woman,
                    enthroned as mistress of the plantation, became chief guardian of familial integrity. She was given
                    extensive authority and put on a pedestal by her worshiping Cavalier husband—substitutes
                    for the blandishments of feminism. At the same time the planter and his run-down plantation were
                    given a function that transcended mere economic success.
            These examples show how, in Taylor's view, ante bellum novelists tried to examine, resolve,
                    or sublimate the problems besetting American society. He draws his material from the lives and works
                    of William Wirt, James Fenimore Cooper, James K. Paulding, Sarah Hale, Beverly Tucker, William
                    Gilmore Simms, John Pendleton Kennedy, and others.
            The danger in attempting a difficult study of this kind is diffuseness, and this book is diffuse.
                    Each of the individual sketches is interesting and valuable. But taken all together they are too
                    long and contain far too many irrelevancies. Taylor's thesis is hard to follow, and so the
                    total effect of the book is weaker than it might have been. The summary "Epilogue"
                    is helpful, but cannot entirely repair the damage.
            Another defect of the book springs from Taylor's handling of the historical reality out of
                    which this fictional sociology grew. He sometimes makes disturbing assertions about ante bellum
                    America, especially about the South. For instance: "Those novels which give expression to
                    the racial theories of the Old South, the reiterated appeals to an English ancestry (even by those
                    without one) and the Cavalier ethos of war and honor best embody the aspirations and the sense of
                    destiny of Southern society as a whole" (p. 203). Here Taylor himself seems to have fallen
                    under the spell of the legend-makers. Such ideas more likely embodied the aspirations of only a
                    small segment of southern society, mainly the upper middle class, and only a part of that. Most
                    southern whites were small farmers who owned no slaves: tough, hard-bitten countrymen with the
                    earthy mores and ambitions of a section that was largely semifrontier. These men, the majority, had
                    no such inflated aspirations; they would have found the idea supremely funny.
            Other assumptions can be questioned. Was the South really the most expansionist part of the country?
                    Were the nonslaveholding whites, along with women and slaves, really in a subordinate position in
                    the South? And is it true that the division between North and South was psychological, not
                    geographical? Finally, to say that the Confederate government "was not essentially
                    different, even in its constitutional details, from the federal republic from which it had just
                    seceded" (p. 336) is to miss the point of forty years of controversy about the meaning of
                    the Constitution. In short, the persuasiveness of the connection Taylor tries to establish between
                    ante bellum fiction and ante bellum society is diminished because of the unsoundness of his
                    assumptions about the latter.
            
            
               Cavalier and Yankee is thoughtful, interesting, and valuable for the historian as
                    well as the student of American literature. The author's insight into the minds of his
                    subjects is often very impressive. The main defects are the book's lack of focus, dubious
                    interpretations of ante bellum history, and an attempt to prove too much too precisely.

            It is certainly true that diaries form some of our most colorful if not always our most accurate
                    sources of history. Given an intelligent, observant, and active participator in a certain period,
                    and his diary will be extremely useful to the historian. Add to these qualities the feelings,
                    recorded with utmost candor, of a mid-nineteenth-century country boy thrown into strange, often
                    terrifying circumstances, coupled with sometimes lighthearted sometimes grave jottings on love,
                    nature, pranks, and politics, and the general reader has an excellent account of a young 
                        Ohio
                     soldier in the western campaign of the Civil War.
            In the fall of 1861, Owen J. Hopkins enlisted as a private in an 
                        Ohio
                     infantry regiment at the age of seventeen. During the next three and a half years he
                    matured rapidly, traveled with his regiment to 
                        Louisiana
                     and back to 
                        Tennessee
                    , and rose to the grade of lieutenant. Thus he saw much of the Vicksburg campaign, a
                    period of both intense action and "killing inactivity," guard duty in a
                    "rebel" state, and administrative work in a regimental office. These experiences
                    are all related in a clear, vigorous manner which reflects admirably the spirit of the moment:
                    disgust with mud or red tape, helplessness at hunger or unforeseen trouble, hilarity at a victory in
                    his own or another sector of the war. Of all the various moods captured in the diary, however, two
                    stand paramount. The first, the strong feeling for his beloved Julia back in 
                        Ohio
                    , no doubt greatly influenced the second—his constant, serious patriotism
                    despite ribbings and hardship.
            Mr. Bond must have felt a thrill when he first discovered that in early attempts at sophistication
                    the diarist, his wife's father, acquired some mastery of French, for the editor is a
                    long-time professor of French at the University of 
                        Chicago
                    . His full Introduction, well-placed commentary, and numerous and useful footnotes show
                    the care and research which have gone into his task. This volume is no doubt a labor of love. Unlike
                    so many other books of this type, however, it is both a valuable and interesting contribution to the
                    literature of Yankee army life.
            Frank Woodford's Father Abraham's Children, on the other hand, is
                    of an entirely different sort from Under the Flag of the Nation.
                     This series of chapter-long vignettes about 
                        Michigan
                    's role in the Civil War provides a refreshing addition to the exhausting flood
                    of material now appearing on this period. Though limited to the activities of one state, and almost
                    comically proud of its localism, the volume's appeal is not to the inhabitants of 
                        Michigan
                     alone. The book is popularly written and, although reasonably well documented, is
                    obviously intended to present side lights and high points of 
                        Michigan
                     citizens' participation in the war. The word "citizens" and
                    not "soldiers" must be employed, for the volume not only includes several civilian
                    exploits but also the adventures of Emma Edmonds, who, enlisting under male guise, must have shared
                    many of the same emotions as the somewhat better known Calamity Jane.
            The author, the book jacket informs us, is an experienced biographer, and this approach to history is
                    strikingly apparent in his sympathetic treatment of the people who appear in his tales. That he is
                    also chiefly interested in 
                        Michigan
                     history comes readily to the fore. From one of the first 
                        Detroit
                     meetings in the conspiracy aimed at the famed capture of Harper's Ferry,
                    including such notables as John Brown and Frederick Douglass, through what the author certainly
                    considers a major 
                        Michigan
                     contribution at 
                        Gettysburg
                    , to the last great chase of the war—that leading to the capture of Jefferson
                    Davis—Michiganders careen heroically or conspire clandestinely throughout the great
                    conflict. The concluding sentence of the last adventure best sounds the pitch of local patriotism in
                    which the book was written. "With Jefferson Davis safe in the custody of 
                        Michigan
                    , the war was indeed ended!"

               Triumph of Faith: Contributions of the Church to American Life,
                    1865–1900. By Francis P. Weisenburger. ([

                    1962. Pp. vii, 221. Index. $4.95.)
            This book by Francis P. Weisenburger, professor of history at 
                        Ohio
                     State University, presents an orderly and interesting summary of pertinent historical
                    scholarship. Its abundant documentation will prove satisfying to the casual reader and should also
                    fulfill the author's hope of providing new insights and new inspiration for further
                    scholarly work to the serious student of American religious history.
            Weisenburger's present effort stands as a companion volume to his Ordeal of Faith: The
                    Crisis of Church-Going America, 1865–1900 (
                        New York
                    , 1959). In contrast to the trials and tribulations detailed in the earlier volume, the
                    present work sets forth the positive contributions of the church to American life in the same
                    period—from the close of the Civil War to the dawn of the twentieth century.
            The author has chosen to avoid generalities and to present his case through specific illustrations
                    from the lives of hundreds of men and women, many of whom loomed as giants in the last generation of
                    the nineteenth century. Thus he begins with a penetrating analysis of brilliant and sophisticated
                    Henry Adams, from whose life religion had largely disappeared, but who confessed, nevertheless, the
                    belief that without the church the standards of the country would be those of  "tradesmen and Apaches." In contrast to Adams was
                    John M. Harlan, supreme court justice for thirty-four years, who was said to retire at night
                    "with one hand on the Constitution and the other on the Bible, safe and happy in perfect
                    faith in justice and righteousness" (p. 31).
            In twelve chapters limited to 212 pages Weisenburger has dealt with the great preachers of the
                    era—Beecher, Phillips Brooks, Moody, etc.—the faith expressed by the churches,
                    and its relevance in the lives of men. He has made the latter examination under such headings as
                    "Individual Integrity and Conscientiousness," "Decency in Civic and
                    Political Life," "Family and Sex Relationships," "Temperance and
                    Control," and "Efforts to Extend the Circle of Fellowship." The story of
                    the impetus furnished by the churches for social movements such as woman suffrage, prison reform,
                    Negro rights, and world peace is not undertaken here. One could wish that Professor Weisenburger
                    would extend his penetrating analysis to these fields, thereby expanding to a trilogy his treatment
                    of the church in this era of challenge. Certainly in the present volume he has succeeded admirably
                    in delineating the meaning of the church for people in a period of rapid urbanization when faith was
                    tested by the evolutionary hypothesis and the new biblical criticism.

                            Chicago
                         History of American Civilization devotes a volume to each of the major
                    religious faiths of America. Monsignor John Tracy Ellis and Nathan Glazer wrote on Catholicism and
                    Judaism respectively, and now Winthrop S. Hudson, professor of the history of Christianity in the 
                        Rochester
                    -Colgate Divinity School, examines the past and contemporary role of Protestantism in
                    American life. He finds that the shaping Protestantism received in the Colonial period enabled it to
                    fashion a Protestant America in the course of the nineteenth century. In post-Protestant America, as
                    he calls the years since 1914, the influence of Protestantism visibly declined, partly because of
                    Catholic and Jewish competition but chiefly because of internal weaknesses.
            Throughout the volume Professor Hudson associates Protestant strength or weakness with denominational
                    structure and change—this with an insight and clarity that is truly illuminating. As
                    elaborated by the Independent 
                        Puritan
                     divines the concept of denominationalism denied that the true Church of Christ could be
                    identified with any single ecclesiastical system. As this theory gained general acceptance it
                    justified religious diversity and religious freedom without impairing essential unity, which assumed
                    a Calvinist expression in the Colonial period and increasingly a Methodist orientation in the early
                    decades of the nineteenth century. This unified Protestantism, making extensive use of voluntary
                    societies, overcame irreligion and incipient barbarism  on the
                    expanding frontier and sought to reach the unchurched masses in the growing cities by
                    YMCA's, institutional churches, and other religio-social agencies.
            In this Protestant America that took shape the stress was on conversions, not on the passage of
                    "wholesome laws" to usher in a Christian society. More inexcusable, laissez-faire
                    philosophy was invested with divine sanction. But these shortcomings, in time partially overcome,
                    proved less damaging than the "theological erosion" which in post-Protestant
                    America severed the identity between the major old-line denominations (Congregational-Christian,
                    Presbyterian, Episcopal, Methodist, American Baptist, Disciples of Christ, etc.) and the symbols and
                    creeds of historic Protestantism. These denominations became community churches (in degree but
                    scarcely in kind different from "the world"), and their federational agent, the
                    National Council of Churches, preferred an ecumenical to a Protestant witness. Having lost their
                    identity, the old-line denominations have gained far fewer recruits than Adventist, Holiness, and
                    Fundamentalist denominations which with their uneasy allies in other churches, notably Lutheran and
                    Southern Baptist, constitute about half the numerical strength of present-day Protestantism. Hudson
                    thinks that a "neo-Fundamentalist" version of theological conservatism may in time
                    serve to revitalize and reunify American Protestantism.
            Professor Hudson's American Protestantism is a fine piece of historical
                    writing. True it is that he glorifies the past and depreciates the present, sees events in black or
                    white, and by minimizing the social gospel loses the enrichment that movement might bring to his
                    interpretation. But his handling of denominational realignments as affected by social and
                    theological currents is incisive and masterly.

               Vain Endeavor: Robert Lansing's Attempts to End the American-Japanese
                        Rivalry. By Burton F. Beers. Duke Historical Publications. (Durham, N.C.:
                    Duke University Press, 1962. Pp. ix, 207. Bibliography, index. $6.00.)
            Professor Beers carefully analyzes the efforts of Robert Lansing to end rivalry between the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        Japan
                     over Chinese questions. As counselor of the State Department, Lansing advised Secretary
                    of State Bryan and President Wilson concerning 
                        Japan
                    's seizure of German interests in 
                        Shantung
                     and her Twenty-one Demands on 
                        China
                    . After accepting appointment as secretary of state in June, 1915, Lansing strove for a
                    settlement with 
                        Japan
                    . With particular care Professor Beers discusses the Lansing-Ishii notes,
                    Lansing's negotiations with 
                        Japan
                     over intervention in 
                        Siberia
                    , and his efforts to check Japanese ambitions at the 
                        Paris
                     Peace Conference.
            Of first importance in this book are the differing views on Far Eastern policy held by Wilson and
                    Lansing. Believing the 
                        United States
                     morally obligated to help 
                        China
                     attain a better way of life, the President hoped that American missionaries and
                    businessmen could spread Christianity and democratic ideas in that country. Wilson  recognized 
                        China
                    's potential value as a market and as an ally, but these mundane objectives
                    were not uppermost in his mind: he sincerely believed that uplifting the Chinese people was the
                    principal reason for American interest in their affairs. When he became aware that Japanese
                    aspirations threatened 
                        China
                     with domination, he tended to assume inflexible attitudes toward those aspirations. He
                    thought that 
                        Japan
                     in statements supporting the Open Door had pledged not to encroach upon Chinese
                    sovereignty. Lansing rarely disagreed openly with Wilson in regard to Far Eastern matters, but the
                    Secretary did not believe that 
                        Japan
                     had renounced desire to extend her power and influence in 
                        China
                    . While the Secretary sent 
                        Japan
                     protests based on broad constructions of the Open Door, he thought it unwise for the 
                        United States
                     to found her policy on such interpretations of that doctrine. He did not object
                    altogether to the President's moralistic approach to Sino-Japanese problems, but he was
                    convinced that the chief American objectives in 
                        China
                     should have been protection of American lives and business interests. Fearing that
                    excessively stern protests could cause 
                        Japan
                     to embark upon more ambitious plans to dominate 
                        China
                     or to cause her to desert her alliances, Lansing early came to believe that a bargain
                    partially satisfying Japanese demands was desirable. Occasionally Lansing's views gained
                    limited acceptance, but usually the Secretary found himself checked by the President or by
                    international factors beyond American control. Beers concludes that during the Wilson administration
                    the 
                        United States
                     missed opportunities to settle differences with 
                        Japan
                     and that a settlement could have made possible "substantial American
                    accomplishments in East Asia" (p. 184).
            On occasion one may wish that Professor Beers had included more background material about some of the
                    problems which confronted Lansing, but this carefully written book is nevertheless a highly detailed
                    study. Based largely upon archival and manuscript material, this volume is an important addition to
                    the historiography of American diplomacy.

            Seldom have historians been so marvelously endowed with helpful bibliographical tools as in the past
                    few years. The Library of Congress Guide to the Study of the 
                            United States
                         of America, the American Historical Association Guide to
                        Historical Literature, and the National Historical Publication Commission Guide to Archives and Manuscripts in the 
                            United States
                        
                are today essential items in any well-stocked scholarly library. To that list
                    must be added this meticulously wrought and utterly essential bibliography of the periodical
                    literature of the trans-
                        Mississippi
                     West. Users of these books should regularly recite 
                    a prayer of thanks to the dedicated authors who have made them available.
            Professor Winther's fat volume lists 9,244 periodical, magazine, and journal articles
                    printed between 1811 and 1957. All are classified by subject under alphabetized headings and
                    subheadings for ease of use. Thus a student seeking information on Indian agents has only to turn to
                    the section on "Indians" and the subsection on "Indian Agents"
                    to find twelve articles on his subject, ranging from an 1864 "Report of Commissioner of
                    Indian Affairs" in the North American Review to a learned article on
                    "William Ewing, Agricultural Agent to the Indians" in a 1957 copy of Agricultural History. To assure even greater usefulness, a symbol indicates the nature of
                    each entry as journal or diary, official document, reminiscence, or article. An author index at the
                    end of the volume allows users to trace the publications of any writer quickly and accurately.
            Most of the periodicals used by Professor Winther in compiling his listings are professional
                    historical journals or state and regional quarterlies published in the trans-
                        Mississippi
                     West, although he has included such venerable publications as Niles' Weekly Register and the North American Review. He has
                    also searched the files of such modern publications as the Atlantic Monthly, Overland
                        Monthly, the Political Science Quarterly, and Sociological Review, to
                    name but a few. Any user may be assured that virtually any article touching on his subject, no
                    matter what its source, will be found listed on these pages.
            This volume is a revision of Professor Winther's earlier The Trans-
                            Mississippi
                         West: A Guide to Its Periodical Literature, published in 1942, and listing all
                    articles printed between 1811 and 1938. A comparison of these two editions reveals a sobering fact.
                    The 1942 edition contained 240 pages of text and listed 3,501 items; the 1961 edition runs to 564
                    pages and itemizes 9,244 articles. This means that in the nineteen years between 1938 and 1957
                    historians have produced no less than 5,743 articles on the trans-
                        Mississippi
                     West, or 2,242 more than were published in the 127 years before 1938. If the pace of
                    scholarship continues to accelerate at this rate, Professor Winther's next edition will
                    resemble the unabridged dictionary.
            The value of such bibliographical guides as this increases in direct proportion to the multiplication
                    of historical studies. No student of the West should think of launching any project without
                    consulting its meticulously compiled pages.

               Research Opportunities in American Cultural History. Edited by John Francis

                        Kentucky

            The twelve essays in this book are the result of a conference held under the auspices of the Lilly
                    Foundation in 1959 at 
                        Washington
                     University in 
                        St. Louis
                    . The aim of the conference was to explore possibilities for research in certain areas
                    of American cultural history which, it seemed to the participants, had received less attention than
                         others and in which substantial new research remained to be
                    done. This volume is not intended to be a complete survey of the fields of cultural history and
                    their strengths and weaknesses in offering opportunity for research, nor even a compendium of
                    suggestions for the student of American life. It is, as the editor, Professor McDermott says,
                    "simply a statement of work to be done" (p. v). Limited to twelve areas, because
                    in a two-day conference it was felt that more could not be adequately discussed, the participants
                    dug rather deeply into those fields in which, as their essays amply show, enough work remains to
                    satisfy the most energetic researcher.
            The essays fall into three general groups. The first topic, immigration, is by no means exhausted as
                    a field for investigation, as Professors Cappon, McDermott, Blegen, and Peckham show. Lester Cappon
                    points out the possibilities which lie in a reassessment of the colonial period in relation to a
                    study of the components of early American culture and their influences. John McDermott, limiting his
                    remarks to a single group of settlers, the French in the Mississippi Valley,
                    finds much still to be done with this group alone, not to mention similar nationality groups in the
                    same area. Theodore Blegen shows the still untapped potential of the study of areas, periods,
                    elements, and problems arising from old-world cultural transferences to the New World. Howard
                    Peckham discusses opportunities in the history of Indian-white relationships, still relatively
                    untouched from the point of view of the cultural historian, and of the promise of ethnohistory as a
                    scholarly field.
            The second group deals with research in four general areas of cultural history, each analyzed by a
                    specialist in the field. John T. Flanagan, speaking of unresolved issues in the study of midwestern
                    regional culture, suggests the need for texts, for studies of mining, lumbering, commerce, and
                    farming, and for the study of topics such as the character type in midwestern literature and the
                    role of the immigrant in the regional novel. Studies of the book trade, of publishers and publishing
                    houses, of printers and printing, of the economics of authorship—these are a few of the
                    areas, according to David Kaser, waiting for the researcher into the impact of the printed word on
                    American culture. Joseph Ewen, after a survey of things to be done on American science and
                    scientists, lists nearly forty scientists who worked on the American frontier and of whom little or
                    nothing is known! Despite the number of books written on American travel, Thomas Clark finds that,
                    by using travel literature as a base, the researcher may still usefully study such things as
                    population movements, orientation of foreign elements to American conditions, economic history, and
                    political relationships.
            Four additional essays, dealing with popular culture, education, folklore, the visual arts, and
                    American recreation, round out the collection. Professor Richard Dorson suggests the advantages of
                    folklore study for the cultural historian and indicates the tremendous amount of fresh sources of
                    folklore materials to be found in games, occupational stories, newspaper files, travel books, and so
                    on, David Mead, writing of individuals and institutions involved in promotion of popular culture,
                    shows how much the historian may yet do with the history of libraries,  museums, self-improvement associations, workingmen's projects,
                    oratory, pamphlets, lecture series, and even common school textbooks. Edgar Richardson, writing of
                    the relationships between the visual arts and cultural history, notes that among other deficiencies,
                    there exist no adequate studies of American caricature and cartooning, of collectors and collecting,
                    or even of American sculpture. Philip Jordan finds much the same situation in regard to American
                    sports and recreation; music, theater, organized group sports, and such favorite American pastimes
                    as gambling and card playing have as yet received little attention from the historical researcher.
            Besides being packed full of ideas and information, the collection succeeds admirably in doing what
                    it set out to do, that is, to offer suggestions for profitable research in certain selected areas of
                    American cultural history. One should judge, in fact, that there must be a thousand suggestions here
                    that any alert and enterprising scholar might pursue, and about half that many usable thesis topics
                    for the imaginative graduate student. As an indication of the great potential offered by this kind
                    of discussion of American historical research, the conference was clearly a success; we could use
                    many more of them.

            Now in its twenty-ninth year of operation, the Tennessee Valley Authority has
                    become an American institution. For many, however, federal development of water power resources
                    continues to be a controversial question. As one peruses magazines and newspapers he still finds
                    articles attacking the TVA or defending it. Within the past decade a number of important works have
                    appeared which chronicle the early years of the Tennessee Valley Authority.
                    Among these works are Roscoe Martin's TVA, The First Twenty Years, Judson
                    King's The Conservation Fight: From Theodore Roosevelt to the
                            Tennessee Valley Authority, and David Cushman Coyle's Conservation. Each of these contains a brief discussion of the Muscle Shoals
                    controversy, but Preston Hubbard's book furnishes the first detailed description of this
                    important landmark in American history. The volume is an outgrowth of a doctoral dissertation
                    submitted in 1955 to the history faculty of Vanderbilt University. It constitutes the most
                    comprehensive treatment of the struggle which eventually resulted in the establishment of the
                        Tennessee Valley Authority.
            History has its congruities. Demobilization following each of our major wars has been fraught with
                    the question of how to dispose of war materiel and government properties which have come into being
                    during hostilities. Following World War I the problem arose of what to do with the nitrate plant at
                    Muscle Shoals, 
                        Alabama
                    , which had been built for the production of explosives. Certainly part of the
                    controversy involved the issue of whether the production of cheap fertilizer should be the most
                    important objective of peacetime development of  Tennessee River
                    resources or whether the energy of the river should be utilized primarily for generation of electric
                    power. Yet the most important issue concerned the question of who was to control and develop the
                    available resources—the federal government or private enterprise. Contenders for private
                    development who wished to operate the plant at Muscle Shoals were Henry Ford, the American Cyanamid
                    Company, and a combine of power companies.
            Hubbard's account is a fascinating review of the activities of Ford and the American
                    Cyanamid interests in relation to Muscle Shoals and their efforts to circumvent the regulatory
                    aspects of the Federal Water Power Act. The protagonist of federal ownership, operation, and control
                    of water power resources is Senator George W. Norris, Republican liberal of 
                        Nebraska
                    . He is depicted as the leading advocate of federal development of the
                        Tennessee River. Norris proposed development of the Tennessee
                        River basin by the federal government both for the provision of electricity to the
                    people of the valley and for experimentation in the most inexpensive methods of producing
                    fertilizer. The position of proponents of the Norris plan was strengthened by the economic
                    depression of 1929, and Norris' program was assured of success with the election of
                    Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.
            Hubbard's book constitutes a well-organized discussion of TVA history and reflects a good
                    deal of attention to scholarship and style. The reader interested in the author's sources
                    is spared the inconvenience of turning to the back of the book since footnotes appear at the bottom
                    of each page. An extensive bibliography is provided and bespeaks thorough research in primary
                    material. The list of secondary publications, however, is by no means exhaustive nor does it include
                    a single book published since 1950, although a number of significant works on TVA and related
                    history have been published in the last decade. Thus, one does not find the works of David
                    Lilienthal, Roscoe Martin, or the last publications of Judson King and Gifford Pinchot, to mention
                    but a few.
            Surely one of the handicaps which future generations will encounter in assessing conservation and TVA
                    history will be its one-sidedness. It is apparent that to a very large extent sources available to
                    the historian of the conservation fight are expressions of advocates of public ownership, operation,
                    and regulation. One finds relatively few publications defending private ownership and control in the
                    bibliographies of the early and more recent accounts. In TVA literature of the last ten years one is
                    hard put to discover a single volume which is pro-private ownership of the nation's water
                    power resources or, indeed, a volume on the history of the power controversy which is a defense of
                    private power interests. No doubt some will take this dearth as proof positive of the Tightness of
                    the public power cause and the wrongness of the private power interests. Yet such a circumstance is
                    not always the proper basis for such a judgment.
            Preston Hubbard came by his interest in the TVA honestly, for he was born in Winfield, 
                        Alabama
                    , during the beginning of this controversy and for many years lived in 
                        Lawrence County
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    . Having heard arguments on both sides of the power question he was  determined to make a thorough and objective study of the problem once
                    having acquired the necessary professional qualifications. He is currently serving as professor of
                    history in 
                        Austin
                     Peay State College at 
                        Clarksville
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    . His volume constitutes an important addition to the history of the Tennessee
                        Valley Authority and its larger setting in American political, economic, and social
                    history. Professor Hubbard is to be commended for the writing of such a contribution and Vanderbilt
                    University Press for having published the work.

                    $3.75 per volume.) These two volumes provide supplementary readings for basic courses in
                    American history. "The collection as a whole undertakes to present the newer viewpoints in
                    American history. All too frequently the textbook is based on approaches that have to be
                    substantially modified if not altogether discarded. The selections in this book, on the other hand,
                    date almost entirely from 1945—for the greater part, indeed, from 1950. They constitute
                    in this way an anthology of American historical writing since World War II. They indicate the newer
                    directions of American historical thought" (Vol. I, p. v). For the purposes indicated this
                    collection is extremely useful, and it merits careful consideration by teachers of introductory
                    courses in American history. It is, however, important to remember that much which is said to be new
                    is not really new, while much that is new is not actually better than previous writings. Moreover,
                    important as it is for students to be aware of changing viewpoints and interpretations in both
                    recent and previous scholarship, it is at least equally important for teachers and students alike to
                    know and understand the basic facts about important topics and questions in American history. In
                    historical study at least, effective evaluation of viewpoints, new or old, requires much knowledge
                    and considerable understanding of how facts are weighed, how facts differ from opinions, why
                    "final" and unqualified answers are seldom available to numerous questions. The
                    selections in these volumes are drawn from recent books, the proceedings of various organizations,
                    from historical and other journals, etc. They are complete rather than abridged selections. Both the
                        American Historical Review and the Mississippi Valley Historical
                        Review are among the historical magazines quoted, but the number of selections from these
                    outstanding journals is less than that taken from regional, state, and specialized journals.
                    Included among the latter are the William and Mary Quarterly, the Journal of Economic
                        History, the 
                            Pennsylvania
                         Magazine of History and Biography, the Journal of Southern History, Agricultural
                        History, and the Indiana Magazine of History. American Heritage is quoted often enough to
                    suggest that it apparently has received significant acceptance from historians as well as from the
                    public. In short, there seem to be numerous and varied editorial sanctums, but few mansions, in
                    Clio's household.
            
               Immigration and American History: Essays in Honor of Theodore C. Blegen. Edited by
                    Henry Steele Commager. (
                        Minneapolis
                    : University of 
                        New Hampshire
                     Press, 1961. Pp. x, 166. Frontispiece, bibliography, index. $4.50.) This
                    volume includes eleven essays in honor of Theodore C. Blegen by ten different authors. Collectively
                    they offer considerable comment regarding the history of immigration in America, the image emigrants
                    had before coming to the 
                        United States
                    , the impact of the  New World on immigrants, the
                    impact of emigration from Europe to America on developments within Europe, the transit of ideas
                    which accompanied immigration, problems concerning immigration history, and the like—all
                    with something more than a normal Scandinavian accent or emphasis. In the closing essay, Dean Blegen
                    reviews research needs and opportunities in immigration history of the 
                        United States
                    . This modest volume offers a useful commentary on the historical development and
                    current status of publications concerning immigration to this country and related topics. Even so,
                    it must be used with care, for the essays are sprinkled with opinions which the unwary reader may be
                    inclined to accept as fact. For instance, in contrasting 
                        New England
                     and southern elements in the Middle West, Philip D. Jordan writes: "The Yankee
                    was aggressive and hard working, and the Uplander [southerner] was passive and shiftless"
                    (p. 75). Indiana's pioneers were mainly these "passive and shiftless"
                    southerners who cleared an amazing amount of land with simple tools and probably accomplished more
                    physical labor than any succeeding generation of Hoosiers, Yankees or otherwise. In fact, these same
                    "passive and shiftless" southerners pretty well established civilization in
                    Indiana before more than a handful of 
                        New England
                     settlers even arrived.
            
               The Research Function of University Bureaus and Institutes for Government-Related
                        Research. Edited by Dwight Waldo. (Berkeley: Bureau of Public Administration, University of 
                        California
                    , 1960. Pp. ix, 222. Bibliographies.) As the Foreword indicates, "This volume
                    is the product of the Conference on the Research Function of the University Bureaus and Institutes
                    for Government-Related Research, held at 
                        Berkeley
                     [
                        California
                    ], August 17–28, 1959." The conference, and thus the papers
                    constituting this volume, reviewed the origin and historical development of university bureaus and
                    institutes concerned with governmental research, discussed various areas of research in which
                    bureaus and institutes have been involved, considered problems concerning research programs, and
                    methods used, etc. University research bureaus and institutes are mainly a product of the period
                    since World War I. Their beginnings appear to have been closely associated with both the emerging
                    university extension movement and the political ferment associated with the Progressive era.
                    According to Amin Alimard's historical sketch of university bureaus involved in
                    governmental research, "The beginning of the University Bureau movement may be set as 1909.
                    This was the year the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                     established a Municipal Reference Bureau in its extension division" (p. 3).
                    University research bureaus and institutes devote much of their emphasis to research concerning
                    state and local politics and government. Research in these areas is much needed, but universities
                    generally will have to eschew partisan politics and political expediency more than some have to date
                    if they hope to achieve worthwhile results based on research which is honest, nonpartisan, and of
                    maximum usefulness.
            
               Early Midwestern Travel Narratives: An Annotated Bibliography,
                    1634–1850. By Robert R. Hubach. (

                     State University Press, 1961. Pp. x, 149. General bibliography, notes, index.  Paperbound, $6.00.) Professor Hubach offers an
                    extensive and helpful annotated list of midwestern travel accounts for the years,
                    1634–1850. An introductory chapter discusses travel literature and includes a general
                    bibliography concerning such literature. Hubach indicates that travel narratives took various forms,
                    were written for various reasons, and had varying degrees of reliability. By organizing his listings
                    principally on a chronological basis, he gives desirable emphasis to accounts written by Frenchmen,
                    the earliest European visitors to the area. The bulk of the accounts listed, however, were written
                    during the period following the American Revolution, especially during the initial half of the
                    nineteenth century. Hubach offers useful information about the items included in his detailed
                    bibliography. He indicates when they were published or where they are preserved, and he often
                    mentions related information. The 
                        Wayne
                     State University Press is to be commended for publishing this useful volume.

                    suggested reading, index. $3.95.) This is the fourteenth volume in the American Heritage Junior Library series on 
                        United States
                     history. The series was inaugurated late in 1959, and six new titles are added yearly.
                    Profusely illustrated, these books are designed to arouse interest in and increase understanding of
                    the history and heritage of the 
                        United States
                     on the part of children of about ten years of age and older. Steamboats on
                        the 
                            Mississippi
                        
                centers its attention on the use of steamboats on the 
                        Mississippi
                     and its tributaries from 1811 until the 1870's. The narration describes
                    flatboats and keelboats as well as early steamboats, details obstacles and perils to navigation of
                    the Father of Waters, recounts tall tales and folklore associated with transportation on the 
                        Mississippi
                    , and notes the "rebirth" of steamboating on the 
                        Mississippi
                     for a brief interval following the Civil War. At times the author strains to be
                    dramatic and exciting, while he includes but little information about the impact of steamboats on
                    general economic, political, and cultural developments. All in all, however, this volume should be
                    interesting and informative to many adults as well as to numerous teenagers. Moreover, this series
                    by American Heritage is obviously much more desirable for the shelves of school
                    libraries than most volumes normally found there.
            
               Historical and Philosophical Society of 
                            Ohio
                         Bulletin, XX (January, 1962). The Historical and Philosophical Society of 
                        Ohio
                     here offers eight articles about the advent, role, and achievements of the Germans in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , especially during the period from about 1825 until the early twentieth century.
                    Considerable emphasis is given to the cultural life and contributions of the Germans, who played a
                    very significant role in the development of the 
                        Queen City
                    . According to Professor Carl Wittke, the initial Turnverein in the 
                        United States
                     was organized in 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1848 (p. 11). Fortunately some of the old records of the 
                        Cincinnati
                    
                    Turnverein have recently have been discovered and are now  included in the valuable collections of the Historical and
                    Philosophical Society of 
                        Ohio
                     which has its headquarters at 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The increased collection, preservation, and use of such records is essential to any
                    adequate study of the Germans in the Middle West. Since the Germans have been the most important
                    non-English element in Indiana, their status and achievements in Indiana deserve much more
                    consideration than has heretofore been received. If any of the readers of the Indiana
                        Magazine of History know of similar records regarding the Germans in Indiana, the editor
                    would appreciate hearing from them.

                    These two books are reprints of items written by Otho Winger about a generation ago. (Various titles
                    are included in each volume; however, only the initial title in each volume is indicated above.)
                    Although obviously not entirely current in their scholarship, these books offer useful information
                    about Frances Slocum, the Miami Indians, and various Miami leaders. School libraries of Indiana
                    lacking original copies of Dr. Winger's books should add these reprints to their
                    collections of books about Indiana's history and heritage.
            The staff of the Indiana Civil War Centennial Commission has prepared a list of Indiana Civil War
                    regiments and companies by counties. This list recently appeared in the October and December, 1961,
                    issues of the Indiana History Bulletin, which is published by the Indiana
                    Historical Bureau, 140 North Senate, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The compilation is especially useful in locating the counties from which particular
                    regiments were recruited and the county or counties from which the member companies were
                    constituted. The list offers abundant evidence of the fact that during the Civil War men from the
                    same or neighboring counties were almost certain to fight in the same companies rather than in
                    different ones. Anyone wishing the names of members of a particular company or desiring basic
                    information about the war service of particular persons, however, will need to consult the
                    indispensable record known as Report of the Adjutant General of the State of
                    Indiana (8 vols., 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Ind., 1865–1869). Even then, some ability as a detective and a generous
                    amount of good luck are often essential to successful results.
            
               A Dictionary of Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases from Books Published by Indiana Authors
                        before 1890. Compiled by Jan Harold Brunvand. Indiana University Folklore
                        Series, Number 15. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1961. Pp. xxxiv, 168. Bibliography, appendix. Paperbound,
                    $3.00.) This is a listing of proverbs and proverbial phrases from a selected
                        list of nearly one hundred books published by Indiana authors preceding 1890. The listing
                    is the result of composite research since, as indicated in the Preface (p. vii), about a  dozen persons contributed to the research which resulted in this
                    collection. According to Brunvand, there are about fifteen hundred separate sayings in this
                    compilation, about one-third of which are comparisons, slightly more than one-third proverbial
                    phrases, and the remainder proverbs and sententious remarks (pp. xii-xiii). "The largest
                    group of proverbs and proverbial phrases relating to one literary source are Biblical sayings,
                    either allusions to names or places in the Bible, or quotations and misquotations from the
                    Bible" (p. xiii). Various of the items listed probably developed from experience in and
                    observation of pioneer life in Indiana or elsewhere. At least, such listings as
                    "He'll be in ‘fore long, a drippin’ like a ash-hopper
                    an' es wet es a swamp" (p. 4); "A man ‘as tight as the bark on
                    a beech tree’" (p. 7); "Jack of all trades and master of none"
                    (p. 78); and "She's as sweet as maple sugar" (p. 92) quite likely would
                    have been much better understood by most Hoosier pioneers, even by those who were illiterate, than
                    by most Ph.D.'s of this generation.
            
               Indiana Public Affairs Notes, IV (January-February, 1962), published by the Bureau
                    of Government Research at Indiana University, is devoted to a brief but informative discussion by
                    Richard I. Hofferbert of "The Lieutenant Governorship in Indiana." Mr. Hofferbert
                    reviews the status of the office of lieutenant governor in the various states (and notes that eleven

                    gives most of his attention to the increased role and importance of the lieutenant governor in
                    Indiana government and politics since 1933. According to Mr. Hofferbert, "The present
                    lieutenant governor, Richard O. Ristine, is only the second person to fill the office whose party
                    identification was at variance with the governor's" (p. 4).

                    Huffman, which appeared in the Indiana History Bulletin for September, 1961, has
                    deservedly received much favorable comment. Its illustrations of, commentary about, and summary
                    listing concerning automobiles built in Indiana are very interesting and also of historical value.
                    Mr. Huffman is aware "that there are many controversies in a subject of this
                    nature" but thinks his listing of Indiana made automobiles is "essentially
                    correct" (p. 144).

                    performs a useful service in publishing its successive editions of this volume. The absence of any
                    adequate and current general account of state and local government in this state makes Here Is Your Indiana Government of increased value to school and public libraries.

                    Illustrations, tables, purchasing directory, index. Paperbound, $3.00.) This initial
                    edition of The Indiana Almanac and Government Guide has considerable information
                    and data concerning each of the ninety-two counties of the Hoosier States. Useful information is
                    also offered regarding state government and Indiana officials who serve the federal government. The
                    history and current operation of political parties is discussed. All in all, here is much
                    information which can be used to advantage by students and teachers of Indiana government and
                    history, although, to be sure, this volume is no substitute for scholarly publications. Moreover, it
                    includes some unfortunate errors of fact, but these can doubtless be corrected in subsequent
                    editions. This volume—it might be called a Hoosier Political
                    Almanac—despite its Republican sponsorship gives approximately equal space to the
                    Democrats. The value of its sketches and compilations is increased by the fact that this material is
                    offered, at least in the main, in a factual and nonpartisan manner. Such a publication, if
                    continued, can become a useful source of information about Hoosier politics and government. It is
                    hoped that the 1962 edition will include copies of state political platforms, while some information
                    should also be given about minor parties.
            
               Architects in America of Catholic Tradition. By Francis W. Kervick. (Rutland, Vt.:
                    Charles E. Tuttle Co., 1962. Pp.140. Numerous illustrations. $10.00.) Professor Kervick,
                    head of the Department of Architecture at Notre Dame University, includes numerous brief sketches
                    about American architects associated with Roman Catholicism. In addition, several dozen plates
                    illustrating their work indicate the beauty and variety of the buildings these architects have
                    designed. Both sketches and illustrations show that impressive buildings of a secular nature as well
                    as those of a religious nature have often been designed by Roman Catholic architects. A number of
                    the architects named were from the Midwest, while various of the plates show buildings in the area,
                    especially those located in 
                        St. Louis
                     and

                    : Alfred A. Knopf, 1960. Pp. xlviii, 294, lxi. Maps, index. $8.50.) Professor
                    Gipson has at last completed his monumental ten-volume work on The British Empire
                        before the American Revolution. The three initial volumes first appeared in 1936, but they
                    were revised and reprinted under different titles in 1958 and 1960. This volume, the third, in its
                    revised edition includes a new chapter on the Lower Counties on the 
                        Delaware
                     and a summary chapter on the British colonial system at the middle of the eighteenth
                    century. The detailed table of contents—see pages xi-xlvi—is extremenly
                    useful, especially in view of the detail included in this volume, which centers its attention on the 
                        New England
                    
                     and Middle Atlantic colonies plus the Newfoundland and Hudson
                    Bay areas, in which emphasis is respectively on the fisheries and fur trade. The final chapter,
                    which offers Gipson's summary view of "The British Colonial System in
                    1750," is an essay of much significance to persons interested in conclusions reached by
                    Gipson. This chapter, because of its appearance in the revised edition of the third volume, has
                    elements of hindsight from subsequent volumes, hence to some extent it is a summary essay to the
                    multivolume work as a whole.

                            New Hampshire
                        , Volume II. Revised edition. By William Watts Folwell. Publications of the

                    $7.75.) This revised edition of the second volume of Folwell's History of 
                            New Hampshire
                        
                is essentially a reprinting of the original Folwell volume which appeared in
                    1924. It is concerned with the years 1858–1865, the early years of statehood for 
                        New Hampshire
                    . Its emphasis on the tragic Sioux uprising and the Civil War make this revision an
                    "anniversary" publication. Russell W. Fridley, of the 
                        New Hampshire
                     Historical Society, explains in his Introduction: "No attempt has been made to
                    bring this work up to date in the light of later research. Minor errors have been corrected; the
                    maps have been simplified; and new illustrations have been added." Therefore, apparently in
                    substance this new volume is a reprint rather than a revised edition. Not knowing what corrections
                    and changes have been made is disturbing for scholars eager to know what Folwell wrote and thought.
                    Folwell's history has, of course, been superceded by succeeding ones in some respects and
                    on some important points; all students of 
                        New Hampshire
                     history, however, remain indebted to him. His History of 
                            New Hampshire
                        , which ultimately extended through four volumes, remains useful not only
                    because of the author's use of documentary material but also because of his use of material
                    gleaned from his own personal experiences or from other participants in the events described.
                    Editorial corrections of Folwell's text should have been explicitly indicated.

                        Michigan
                     State University Museum makes use of both historical and archaeological studies as a
                    basis for a proposed restoration of Fort Michilimackinac at 
                        Mackinac City
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    . The emphasis, however, is upon archaeological rather than historical evidence as a
                    guide for the restoration. Anyone at all familiar with the early history of the Midwest is, of
                    course, aware that there was a fort of importance at 
                        Michilimackinac
                     during the French and English periods. Such a person, however, is probably troubled by
                    questions such as which of several spellings of the fort's name is accurate, where the fort
                    was located, and how many forts there were of the same or a similar name. The initial fort was
                    located at St. Ignace on the southern tip of the Upper Peninsula. The one here  under study was located at the present 
                        Mackinac City
                     and a later one was built on Mackinac Island. The research and field work upon which
                    this volume is based were mainly completed during the summer of 1959. Since then work has continued,
                    and a subsequent publication will doubtless add additional information to our knowledge of Fort
                    Michilimackinac at 
                        Mackinac City
                    , which existed from about 1715 until near the end of the American Revolution. In view
                    of the importance of Fort Michilimackinac during the eighteenth century, the restoration project and
                    the increased knowledge being derived therefrom are of interest and value to students of Midwest
                    history.

                    Farming was diversified at Ferry Hill Plantation; Ferry Hill had no staple crop, and it apparently
                    had no overseer to supervise its slaves. The plantation was located in what is now 
                        West Virginia
                    . This journal is a useful antidote for students and professors who fail to realize the
                    great variety which existed in the states which came to constitute the Southern Confederacy. As
                    would be expected, Fletcher M. Green seems to have done a very competent job of editing.

                    History Department at Indiana University since 1957, has written a number of well-known books
                    concerning American folklore, especially that of 
                        New England
                     and the Middle West. During 1956–1957 he was a Fulbright professor in
                    American Studies at the University of Tokyo. The present volume is in part a result of his contacts
                    with Japanese folklorists during that year. For a historian to evaluate folklore is always a bit
                    risky, and especially so when the author is both a colleague and fellow editor. Hence, Professor
                    Dorson can speak for himself through his Introduction: "The present book is intended to
                    bring a representative selection of Japanese folk legends to Western readers." And:
                    "In making selections for this volume I have attempted to represent major themes, different
                    geographical areas, and important collections of Japanese oral legends" (p. 29).
