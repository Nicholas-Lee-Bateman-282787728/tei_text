            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> Road. With only a few minor changes in routing, this road, over a century old, still
                    curves up across Indiana from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName> in the southeast to <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>

            rend="sup">1</hi> Until the railroads
                    were built, this most famous of Indiana's state highways was used more than any other route
                    of travel in the state, with the exception of the Gateway route, the Old National Road. Half of the
                    pioneers of northwestern Indiana reached their homes over this road. It passed through fourteen
                    counties and was used by the inhabitants of thirty-five in going to the capital.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Built in the decade of 1830 to 1840 and still serving as one of the state's main
                    thoroughfares, its career to date might be summed up in the phrase—a decade to build, a
                    century of use.</p>
        <p>There was great need for the new road. The immigrant needed a way to reach the lands opened in
                    central Indiana by the New Purchase of 1818. After he had settled, cleared, and started producing,
                    he needed a means of disposing of his surplus; in fact, the prospects of disposing of his surplus
                    generally determined the place of settlement. The new territory as well as the older sections needed
                    more and better connections with the central part of the state and with the capital, which had been
                    transferred to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

        <p>The argument of military necessity for the road was useful in Congress in securing the necessary
                    appropriation to make a treaty with the Indians. In his monograph, "The <placeName>

          </placeName> Trade Route in the Development of the Old Northwest," Elbert J. Benton wrote:

            <p>Together with the economic factors voiced in the demand for national aid in constructing
                            roads and canals, there was a strong military need. The experience of the Northwestern
                            campaigns of the War of 1812 had demonstrated the futility of military operations with
                            inadequate means of transporting troops and supplies. These expeditions were almost
                            invariably failures due to defective transportation…. In Congress this motive was

          </placeName> was another leading factor in the plans for this road. Not only would the land secured
                    directly bring about the westward movement of the Indians, but the road and the lands adjoining
                    would serve as a wedge in bringing about further removals.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    the streams.</p>

                    next two decades. The provision for the survey of the National Road in 1806 was not the beginning of
                    a federal program of internal improvements, but it opened the way for a growing demand that Congress
                    finance these improvements. Congress partially complied with the demand by directing Secretary of

            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>

                    Public Lands in Congress. Hendricks, who was the immediate predecessor of Ray as chief executive of
                    the state, presented a resolution asking the <placeName>

        <p>The construction of a road by means of a land grant from the federal government was not

        <p>In the early days of Indiana a candidate for office hardly dared announce himself unless he favored
                    internal improvements. The subject was agitated as early as 1818, during the administration of
                    Governor Jennings. He, as well as every chief executive of the state down to 1843, when the system
                    collapsed, made it a special point in his messages to the legislature to urge the adoption of
                    measures for the construction of highways and canals and the improvement of navigable rivers.
                    Jennings, in his message to the legislature in December, 1818, urged the consideration of a system
                    of canals and roads to facilitate commerce, enhance the value of the soil, and remove local
                        jealousies.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Roads and canals did remove some prejudices, but while the
                    routes were being chosen local jealousies were usually at high pitch.</p>
        <p>William Hendricks, successor to Jennings as governor, specified to the Assembly in 1822 as most
                    important the improving of the Falls of the <placeName>

                    wished to realize the advantages of her resources. While we have evidence that Governor Ray did not

                    doing, he secured letters from the other two commissioners which bear out the fact that he deserved
                    and desired to have credit for securing the grant. He made the project one of his chief hobbies for

                    Large areas of Indian land or untaxable public domain made it almost impossible for these states to
                    finance road or canal projects for themselves, and they sought federal aid through land grants.
                    Sectional jealousies became strong. The demand of western states for federal aid for roads and

        <p>The simple bribery and high pressure salesmanship practiced by the white man's treaty
                    experts in persuading the Indians to sign treaties giving away, bit by bit, lands that had probably
                    been promised in previous treaties never to be disturbed is obviously and typically illustrated in
                    this council of 1826. The council opened on October 5, with General Cass as spokesman for the
                    commissioners. He explained the proposal to buy more land from the Indians and told them to take all
                    the time they wanted to consider the proposition. The younger Potawatomi chiefs were strongly
                    opposed to ceding any more land, but sixty-two of the chiefs and warriors were finally induced on
                    October 16 to sign the treaty. The Miamis, who were also invited to the council, were more
                    determined not to sell their land and could not be persuaded to sign the treaty.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> No speech by General <placeName>

        </p>
        <p>By Article One of this treaty the Indians ceded a strip of land which averaged about ten miles in

        <p>With the treaty concluded, Governor Ray wished to speed further action on his project. His message to
                    the Assembly in December, 1826, two months later, showed him in good form on his favorite subject,
                    devoting more space to the need of internal improvements than to any other public problem and
                    painting a rosy future for the state, now that the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
          </placeName> Canal and <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> Road projects were ready to be launched.</p>
        <p>One of his statements was an excellent index to the enthusiasm of the man. "Nine-tenths of
                    Indiana soil could be cultivated and would support ten million people. Therefore," he
                    continued, "we must rely on roads as the safest and most certain state policy, to relieve
                    our situation, and place us among the first in the Union." Roads were less expensive than
                    canals, he contended.</p>
        <p>Turning to the Miami and Potawatomi treaties, he reported that, "with the view of
                    extinguishing their title to lands," these treaties had resulted in the cession to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName> of between two and three million acres of land within the limits of Indiana. Having
                    explored a large part of this territory in person, the governor testified to its great value: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>No new country can produce greater inducements to the emigrant— with its rich
                            soil, permanent streams for manufactories, living springs, extensive quarries of limestone,

                            natural position for commerce, it may be esteemed as the first new country in value, now in
                            market in the government. In it an industrious and economical people may grow rich and
                            happy.</p>
          </quote>
        </p>
        <p>He characterized the road provision as the "grand project" and as an important and
                    interesting national and state object. He cited the military value of the road, pointing out that <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> was the only lake belonging exclusively to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> and that it could support a navy. If we should ever have to meet "our old
                    enemy" again, we should expect to meet her in the north; and this would make the road
                    important from a national point of view.</p>
        <p>Secondly, Ray mentioned how valuable the road would prove to emigrants from many of the states in
                    going to homes in the rich new territory which was "the principal object of the
                    treaty." "Such a road," he said, "will point to the heart of <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName>, and she ought to be alive to its success."</p>
        <p>These considerations, plus the incalculable advantages of the road to the people of Indiana, the
                    character it would lend the state, the choice of markets it would create, the money its construction
                    would scatter among the laborers, the inducement it would provide to settle the wild lands of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>, the fact that it would cross the National Road at right angles at the seat of
                    government, the assistance it would give to the farmer and merchant in transporting heavy articles
                    to and from the lake or the <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName> at pleasure, and the general figure it would make upon the map of the state all
                    combined to demonstrate the expediency of the measure, Ray enumerated. He requested that the
                    legislature send a memorial to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> to encourage the ratification of the treaty.</p>

        <p>It is of special interest to note this statement at the conclusion of Governor Ray's eulogy
                    of this project: "The grant severs the remaining Indian possessions; and when the land
                    granted for this purpose is settled, it will weaken the attachment of the Pottowattamie to his

                    struck out of Article Two the clause giving to the state sole right of disposal of the grant, on the

                    dispose of public lands. This was a power of Congress. But this authority was given to the state by
                    the act of March 2, approved by President John <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
          </placeName> Adams, confirming the treaty grant. The act authorized the state legislature to locate

                    "No pledges… will make the land… sell like the finished thoroughfare

        <p>But now the controversies began; born in controversy, the road has lived in that atmosphere. Probably
                    the first strife connected with the project was the affair of personal politics between Ray and some
                    of his opponents over his alleged violation of the constitution by serving as a member of the treaty
                    commission. Then came a dispute with the secretary of war, for which the Assembly blamed Ray. The
                    legislature itself squared away for a two-year battle over the location of the southern terminus, in
                    addition to minor disputes concerning the appointment of commissioners and contract letting. The
                    General Land Office was in disagreement for a time concerning the selection of the lands. After the
                    road was built, probably the most famous tribulation concerning it was the case of the Western Union
                    Telegraph Company <hi
            rend="i">v</hi>. Krueger, a right of way dispute which affords an excellent
                    discussion of the road.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> In recent years the state has had to resort to the
                    courts to repossess its 100-foot right of way.</p>

        <p>During the 1827–1828 session of the General Assembly, the House of Representatives passed
                    a resolution of censure which charged Ray with violating the constitution in serving as an Indian
                    commissioner while governor and asked him to forfeit his office. He was asked to appear and explain
                    his conduct, but he refused. Instead, he followed the example of Governor Jennings, who had been
                    censured for a similar action, and wrote a letter to the Assembly. A resolution against Governor Ray
                    lost by a vote of twenty-seven to thirty-one.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>

        <p>Governor Ray was accused of accepting from the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

          </placeName> pay at the rate of eight dollars per day for double the time he actually served, while
                    at the same time he received his salary as governor.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> He was also charged with
                    entering at an exorbitant price on the expense list his horse, which he had given to an Indian at
                    the treaty grounds.</p>
        <p>In his defense, Ray asked Cass and <placeName>
            <region type="county">Tipton</region>

          </placeName> to write letters concerning his conduct. Three years later, in 1830, he submitted these
                    letters to the Assembly to show that the commissioners did not consider the road grant a separate
                    cession in the treaty.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The <placeName>
            <region type="county">Tipton</region>
          </placeName> letter indicates that Governor Ray's desire to secure a land cession for a
                    road and canal was very ambitious and did somewhat endanger the conclusion of the treaty. The treaty
                    journal reveals that Ray did not participate very actively in the actual council with the Indians;
                    but the journal does not record the proceedings within the commission, as these letters indicate.
                    His insistence on the road grant, both letters agree, prolonged the council. It is obvious that Ray
                    had asked the two to certify that he was chiefly responsible for securing the road grant.</p>
        <p>But the land grant was now at the disposal of the legislature for the construction of a road the full
                    length of the state, a project of a magnitude few people had as yet thought possible; and the
                    quarrel with Governor Ray was dropped as quickly as it had begun. Matters of far greater importance,
                    the location of the road and the choosing of the lands, faced the legislature; and it lost no time
                    in turning to these problems in the 1827–1828 session. It was to act upon two important
                    internal improvement projects—the <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> Road and the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
          </placeName> Canal.</p>
        <p>The road was made first business, and there began a two-year contention over the location of the
                    southern terminus. The phrase "to some convenient point on the <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName>," used in the Indian treaty, was handed down through the act of Congress
                    confirming the grant and incorporated in the bill in the state legislature. On the settlement of
                    this "point" developed one of the bitterest and longest controversies ever waged
                    in the state Assembly.</p>

                    amendments were concurred in and motions were begun for the location of the point. Two weeks later
                    warm and animated debates were being held in the whole Assembly and in committee. Flowery speeches
                    were in order, relative to the merits of the respective rival points. One made by James G. Reed, of <placeName>

                    terminus, not all the action toward the project was lost. On January 24 a bill was approved

        <p>Haste was considered necessary in surveying the northern route, in order to allow the selection of

        <p>The commissioners, convinced of the impracticability of this direct route across the swamps and
                    through the poor land, determined on a further examination; but due to the extreme fatigue of the
                    party they postponed the further survey until October. They began the October survey on the upper <placeName>

                    fifty-five miles from the lake by the river and thirty-five by the road. A furtrading post had been
                    located here since 1823.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Three years later, March 28, 1831, a town was laid

                    was 102 miles in length, or about thirty miles longer than the direct survey across the Kankakee
                    region. The land along the route was generally good. It was the opinion of the commission that, if
                    the lands were speedily and judiciously chosen, one-half the proceeds would open the road and put it
                    in condition. They reported total expenditures for themselves, their help, and their pack horses as

                    make the final choice between the two routes.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> This furnished one more
                    controversy for the Assembly.</p>
        <p>On February 24, 1828, a few days after the first act was passed, Governor Ray corresponded with
                    Secretary of War James Barbour, to find how the land was to be surveyed and how the state was to
                    take possession. The secretary informed Ray that the land should be taken possession of by surveys.
                    He assumed that lands granted by the treaty were to be laid off along the line of the road, where
                    the.land was of good quality, but not necessarily where such sections were poor. Selections of land
                    made under this assumption, however, were later rejected by the General Land Office, which insisted
                    that lands chosen for the part of the road within the Indian country lie contiguous to the center
                    line of the road. Barbour also stated that no part of the cost of the survey would be borne by the
                    federal government. The Indian agent was to attend the surveys, and it was suggested that two or
                    three Potawatomi chiefs should attend and give consent to the point where the road was to strike the <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName> and to the location of the sections of land.</p>
        <p>Governor Ray conveyed this information to the Assembly in his annual message, December, 1828, by
                    which time the survey from the lake to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> had been completed.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> After reporting the results of his
                    correspondence with the secretary of war, Ray appealed to the legislators to show a spirit of
                    compromise, to put an end to their contention, which appeared to be intermingling itself with both
                    the politics and the legislation of the state, and not further to suspend progress on the road. But
                    his appeal to end the contention over the convenient point was futile; the bill was mired down for
                    the whole session and a full year was practically lost.</p>

        <p>Between sessions, public sentiment against the delay increased. The people felt that the legislature

        <p>In his message to the Assembly, Governor Ray stated that Congress had appropriated $60,000
                    for building twenty-eight miles of the National Road (sixteen miles east and twelve miles west of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName>) in Indiana in 1830. Speaking of the <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName> turnpike, Ray called upon the Assembly to adjust their differences over this question,
                    which had already been the cause of "much artificial, fallacious and embittered controversy
                    and excitement." He hoped for a quick and judicious location of the whole route.</p>
        <p>After reviewing the reports of the commissioners on the two routes surveyed between <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> and <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>, he expressed the opinion that the longer route
                    via the southern bend of the <placeName>
            <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
          </placeName> was unjustified and that the extra length of thirty miles would cause the road to lose
                    much of its utility. The marshy lands, he thought, would make a better graded turnpike than rich
                    soil; and the <placeName>
            <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
          </placeName> could not be relied upon for navigation. To end the political and legislative tangle on

                    for that duty.</p>

        <p>On the question of the disposition of the lands, he recommended that either the lands be used as a

                    section could be completed first, the financial problem simplified, confidence inspired, and the
                    value of the remaining lands increased. Upon the supposition that the total distance would be 230
                    miles, he estimated the lands, at two dollars an acre, to be worth $300,000, or
                    $1,280 per mile, which should make a good clay turnpike with strong wooden bridges, since

        <p>During half the session history repeated itself so far as the decision on the southern terminus was

                    On December 31, by a vote of twelve to eleven, it again passed and sent to the House a bill making <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

        <p>Holman's literary talents were rather extensive. He was especially fond of poetry; and he
                    composed many short verses, which were published. Two lengthy poems, both legends of Indian life,

                    which had a large circulation for that period. Because of this piece of fiction, Holman has been

                    Richard M. Masterson, one of the leading jurists of the state and owner of large tracts of land in
                    the surrounding region. The young couple were married in 1810; and the following year, after the
                    birth of their first child, the three set out for their new home in the Indiana Territory.</p>

        <p>On leaving Kentucky, the Holmans journeyed up the Ohio River and landed in Indiana near the present
                    site of Aurora, in Dearborn County. Accompanying them was a large family of slaves which Mrs. Holman
                    had inherited from her father; but because it was contrary to the Northwest Ordinance and the laws
                    of the Indiana Territory to import slaves into Indiana, they were given their freedom.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> It is quite probable that some of them became indentured servants.</p>

        <p>The country was virtually a wilderness, but the Holmans visualized its future possibilities. They
                    chose a spot four miles down the Ohio River from the growing town of Lawrenceburg and about
                    twenty-one miles below Cincinnati, the "Queen City of the West." Nine
                    miles below them was the town of Rising Sun, a thriving community for that day.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The site which Holman had selected was atop a bluff rising four hundred feet above the Ohio
                    River, which sweeps around in a great bend at this place. Forests clothed all the higher ground, and
                    rich bottom lands gave great promise for future development.</p>

        <p>It was on the very summit of the hill that Jesse Lynch Holman built his log house. It was
                    unpretentious, but sturdy and in keeping with the character of its owner. The Holmans decided to
                    name their new home Veraestau, from parts of three Latin words, <hi
            rend="i">ver,</hi> spring, <hi rend="i">aestas,</hi> summer, and <hi rend="i">autumnus,</hi> autumn. Holman hoped that there
                    would be no winter in the new home, no matter how violently the winds might blow about it.</p>

        <p>Holman might have been influenced in the choice of a name by the circumstances of their arrival. It
                    was in the dead of winter when he brought his young wife and child to their new home; and according
                    to tradition, it was a bitterly cold night. After settling his family in the log cabin, Holman had
                    to walk back two miles to the Eagle Hotel <list type="footnotes">

        <p>Holman lost no time in undertaking the arduous task of subduing the wilderness. There was much to be
                    done; and it was a work of conquest, a struggle with the elements for supremacy. Roads had to be
                    built, swamps drained, and lands cleared and made ready for farming. At first most of
                    Holman's time was devoted to the land, but it was not long before his abilities as a lawyer
                    were put to use. Men of brains, ability, courage, and daring were much needed in the new country;
                    and Holman soon became a leader in the social and political life of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
          </placeName>. He became known as a man of affairs, and his neighbors and friends eagerly sought his
                    advice. On May 28, 1811, Governor William Henry Harrison appointed him prosecuting attorney for <placeName>
            <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
          </placeName> to succeed General James Dill.<hi
            rend="sup">19</hi> A year and a half later he
                    received in addition a <hi rend="i">pro tempore</hi> appointment as prosecuting attorney for <placeName>
            <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
          </placeName> and on November 4, 1812, was formally commissioned to that position.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Holman's circle of influence was thus widening steadily. When, in 1814, Isaac
                    Dunn's resignation left a vacancy in the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Dearborn County</region>
          </placeName> representation in the General Assembly, Holman was chosen to complete the term. His
                    actual service began that summer at the special session of the House called by Governor Posey to
                    reapportion the territory for the election of councilors. With the House members from

          </placeName>, and Gibson counties protesting vigorously that the session had been
                    called illegally and voting against every action of the majority, Holman devoted himself to
                    perfecting the phraseology of the reapportionment resolution to meet their criticisms. His name
                    appears often in the record of the session, considering the fact that he was a new member.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

        <p>Meanwhile, Indiana Territory was assuming some of the characteristics of statehood. By 1815 its total
                    population was in excess of 63,000, and there was considerable agitation to bring the area into the
                    Union on a par with the other states. While there is no evidence to prove that Holman took a very
                    active part in this movement for statehood, yet his activity in subsequent events justifies the
                    assertion that he was eager for the change and worked for it. At any rate, when the first state
                    legislature met at Corydon on November 4, 1816, Holman was one of eight men nominated to represent
                    the state in the national Senate.<hi

        <p>One case in particular which came up during Holman's service on the bench deserves some
                    notice, as it expresses rather conclusively his attitude toward the slavery question. It was purely
                    a test case, which was brought into the state Supreme Court on appeal. No mention of it was made in
                    the press of the day, either during the time it was before the court or after the decision had been
                    announced. It seems unlikely, however, that this indicated little interest or feeling in the matter.</p>
        <p>One side of the argument contended that slavery was excluded from Indiana Territory by the Ordinance
                    of 1787, and from the state by the new constitution of 1816. The contrary argument maintained that
                    the Ordinance of 1787 not only did not prohibit slavery that already existed at the time of its
                    adoption, but that it even expressly preserved it, and that the slave property guaranteed by it
                    could not be taken away by the constitution. Judges Scott, Holman, and Black-ford took a middle
                    ground. They held that the <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>

          </placeName> deed of cession and the Ordinance itself were immaterial, and that the question must be

                    emancipate slaves. Such action had been taken in several of the states. The judges reasoned that it
                    was within the legitimate powers of the constitutional convention to prohibit the existence of
                    slavery in the state. They contended that the framers of the state constitution intended a total and
                    entire prohibition of slavery, and they could conceive of no form of words in which that intention
                    could have been more clearly expressed. By this decision, the slavery question in Indiana was
                    brought to an absolute end, so far as any legal basis was concerned.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

        <p>While Holman was serving on the state bench, he was requested to help lay out the town of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Decatur</region>
          </placeName>. In 1819, Holman was named a trustee for the "<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Aurora</settlement>
          </placeName> Association for Internal Improvements," a group of about twenty men residing
                    in <placeName>

          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>

          </placeName>, and Indiana, organized for the purpose of laying out the town. Holman was chosen
                    president at the first meeting of the association, and the legal title of the land was vested in
                    him. It was decided that the company "proceed by themselves or their directors to lay out a
                    town, to build an ox saw-mill and grist-mill, a bridge across Hogan Creek, a warehouse or such other
                    improvements as they may judge proper." The land, except for a small reservation at Hogan
                    Creek, was conveyed to Holman, in trust for the association, on January 14, 1819, and "the
                    original plat of the town was acknowledged by Mr. Holman as trustee… on January 30, 1819,
                    and recorded the same day." Holman resigned as director, trustee, and treasurer of the
                    association, however, on October 24, 1822, because of his duties on the state Supreme Court. He was
                    thanked by the association for the "ability, wisdom, impartiality and integrity with which

        <p>During his first term on the state Supreme Court, Holman was mentioned as a possible successor to
                    Governor Jennings. In fact, early in 1819, he was the only one who was even considered as an
                    opponent of the governor<hi rend="sup">42</hi> But his popularity was not general throughout the
                    state at this time, nor was he very much interested in leaving the bench.</p>

        <p>Apparently his friends were boosting him for the position without his knowledge or approval. In a
                    letter dated May 19, 1819, he attempted to remove the impression from the minds of his
                    fellow-citizens that he would allow his name to be used at the ensuing election. He vigorously
                    condemned those people who were determined on his candidacy. He asserted in the letter that the use
                    of his name in the public press had originated by mistake, which he would have corrected earlier had
                    he been aware of the circumstance. He wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Flattered as I have been by the solicitude of my friends; feeling the warmest sentiments of

                            some unpleasant sensations that I feel myself compelled by domestic concerns to act contrary
                            to their wishes; and to inform my fellow-citizens generally, what I have uniformly declared
                            to those with whom I have conversed on the subject, that it is not my desire to be
                            considered as a candidate for the distinguished office of Governor.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

        <p>He further stated in his letter that it had been reported that his name had been used as a possible
                    candidate, on the authority of a letter which he had written; but he declared that this was
                    undoubtedly a mistake, since he felt certain that he had not written a letter to any person on the
                    subject. When his friends had first requested that he become a candidate, he had unhesitatingly
                    replied that he did not seek the office; but he had later consented to take the subject under
                    consideration, when his friends, continued to insist. In a very short time, he wrote, he had become

        <p>It was also claimed in this letter that, before he had been able to reach his friends, his name had
                    gone forward as a potential candidate. His friends, therefore, had continued to place his name
                    before the people. While this had increased his reluctance to disappoint them and had increased his
                    gratitude to them, it had not altered his domestic duties nor his final determination. Finally, he
                    declared that while he thus declined the offer of his friends, he assured them <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>that their zeal in my behalf, has exerted in me the most grateful
                            feelings—feelings which I hope will have their proper object in stimulating - my
                            utmost exertions, so to discharge the duties of public and private life, that those, whose
                            partiality would now confide to me the highest trust, may never blush to own that they were

        <p>In spite of the expressions contained in this letter, however, Holman had been advised early by
                    Jennings himself that there was a movement under way to make him governor. In a letter from Corydon,
                    dated December 19, 1818, Jennings described the political situation existing at the time and
                    declared that there were several people who seemed very anxious to bring forth a candidate who could
                    defeat him. "Those who are most desirous of affecting me," he wrote,
                    "urge the idea of bringing you forward as a candidate for the office of Governor at the
                    next election."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
        </p>

        <p>The fears of Jennings regarding the ensuing election were without foundation, as future events
                    proved. His opponent turned out to be Christopher Harrison, whom Jennings defeated by an
                    overwhelming majority.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

        <p>On completing his first term on the state Supreme Court bench, Holman was appointed to another
                    seven-year term by Governor Hendricks. His commission was dated December 29, 1823; and he took the

        <p>During Holman's second term on the state Supreme Court, political jugglery ran riot
                    throughout the state of Indiana, and the judges were soon to feel the political ax. Long before
                    their terms expired in 1830, Governor James <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
          </placeName> Ray intimated that he would not reappoint them. In due time, therefore, Judge James
                    Scott, of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Clark County</region>
          </placeName>, and Holman found themselves the victims of the governor's threat. Judge Isaac <placeName>
            <region type="county">Blackford</region>

          </placeName>, however, was reappointed, largely because, according to Oliver H. Smith, he had been
                    the competitor in the gubernatorial race against Governor Ray, who now thought he could make friends
                    in the Black-ford ranks by renominating his former opponent.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
        </p>
        <p>It had been fully expected at first that Governor Ray would not dare carry out his threat. Writing

            <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>

          </placeName> on November 13, 1830, Horace Bassett reported to Holman that it was the general feeling

        <p>The charge was made at the time, and it was very generally believed, that Ray had refused to
                    reappoint Holman and Scott because they had declined to aid him in his senatorial aspirations. This
                    action cost him many friends, and his popularity waned and finally disappeared. The people believed
                    that Ray was prompted more by personal reasons than by the public good; therefore they withdrew
                    their support and confidence from him.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Shortly after Holman retired from the state bench, some of his friends persuaded him to seek election
                    to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Senate to succeed his old friend, General James Noble, who had recently died in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

          </placeName>. In a letter to "Brother Holman," Dennis Pennington, writing from his
                    home in Corydon, expressed elation over such a possibility and pledged his full support.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
        </p>
        <p>There was, however, considerable opposition to Holman's candidacy. Writing from his home in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
          </placeName>, August 13, 1831, his friend David Hoover warned Holman that the new legislature would
                    be definitely against him, and would favor either John Test, Thomas Blake, or James Rariden,
                    although it appeared that John <placeName>
            <region type="county">Tipton</region>
          </placeName> had a slight edge over all the other candidates.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> A rather
                    optimistic note was struck in a letter addressed to Holman from John A. Farnham, dated at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
          </placeName>, August 22, in which he insisted that the legislature would support Holman.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Holman evidently lost no time in attempting to enlist support. That fall he was very active
                    throughout the state in the interest of his candidacy, even going into the home districts of his
                    rivals. By early November, he had completed his tour through the <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName>;
                    and on November 9 he wrote from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

        <p>As the vote in the legislature showed, however, Holman and his friends were mistaken about his rivals
                    and their strength, as well as his own chances of success. The legislature was strongly against him
                    and on the sixth ballot chose John <placeName>

            rend="sup">57</hi> It is quite
                    apparent from a letter written by Seth M. Levenworth to Holman soon after his defeat that the

                        members.<hi rend="sup">58</hi>

          </placeName> of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
          </placeName>, Holman gave his own account of the political manipulations during the election.
                    "It was such a' conflicting sum of intrigue and deception," he wrote,
                    "that much of the mysterious perplexity still hangs over it. And accounts were so confused
                    and contradictory that I grew sick of the details and left <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> in two days after the election was over." He remarked that Test had been
                    talked of as a candidate until a day or two before the election, when he declined. "Rariden
                    was kept in heart by O. H. Smith &amp; <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
          </placeName> Jackson men who did not intend to support him," he declared. "Blake
                    was also supported by a number of Jackson men who did not want him elected—they wanted to
                    push him ahead of me at first," Holman said. As to his own support for senator when the
                    balloting occurred, Holman claimed that he was not able to determine who were his friends. So many
                    told him and his friends that they had voted for him that he was at a loss "to select among
                    them the number of votes I really got."</p>

        <p>Holman claimed that he had less regret over the election than had the great body of his friends. He
                    would as a matter of choice remain quietly at home rather than have a seat in the Senate of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>. He assured his son-in-law that no office of honor or profit could repay the
                    "sickening feelings I endured while witnessing the corruption &amp; duplicity that
                    attended the senatorial canvass." He had done all that his friends had asked of him, and
                    "there was no arrangement left untried that seemed to promise success." He felt
                    that one vital reason for his defeat was the very powerful combination against all advocates of
                    temperance, Sunday schools, and Bible and tract societies, in which he had always taken a strong
                    interest.</p>

        <p>Holman further declared that the rotation-in-office policy had spread in favor, and that the people
                    were now demanding younger men in office. "A man acts wisely in knowing the proper time
                    when he should cease to struggle for public office," he wrote. He also tried to console
                    himself by contending that his family, "especially Richard," required his
                    attention at home. He believed that in many cases where men had filled high offices, "it
                    would have conduced to the welfare of society &amp; the happiness of their families" if
                    they had devoted more time "to the rearing up of their children."<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

        <p>When Holman retired from the state bench after fourteen years of service, he found abundant
                    opportunity to engage in the many activities which had always meant so much to him. He really
                    enjoyed this vacation from political labors. He loved to spend his time with his family at
                    Veraestau, which had become one of the most celebrated homesteads in Indiana. <list type="footnotes">

        <p>The attitude of Holman on the question of Sunday schools is well expressed in a paper which he wrote
                    on the subject. In refuting the arguments against such schools, he compared them to the common
                    schools of the day. He declared that the best teachers of the public schools were also found in the
                    Sunday schools, and that the one school was complementary to the other. He praised the
                    inexpensiveness of the Sunday schools, which he attributed to the voluntary labor of the teachers.
                    He hailed the movement as a "powerful guarantee of civil and religious liberty"
                    and attempted to prove that the Sunday schools were strong factors in shaping the destinies of a
                    republican form of government.<hi rend="sup">76</hi>

                    churches against all such benevolences.<hi rend="sup">89</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The situation had become so acute by the early thirties, that it was decided to form a general
                    association or state Baptist convention, to act as a clearing-house for the many problems facing the
                    denomination. Forty-one representatives met at the Brandywine Church in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Shelby County</region>

          </placeName> on April 26, 1833. They came from fifteen counties and from twenty different churches.
                    Judge Holman was chosen the moderator, and it was he who prepared the constitution for the state
                        organization.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
        </p>
        <p>For the next five years, Holman served as the president of the convention.<hi
            rend="sup">91</hi>
                    During this time, one of the major problems to come before the body was that of general education
                    among the Baptists of the state. The more progressive church leaders believed that the poor
                    scholastic attainment of their ministers was the cause of their opposition to benevolent projects.
                    Holman, with a few of the others who brought about the birth of the state convention, insisted that
                    steps be taken immediately to launch a state-wide educational drive; but the majority at first
                    considered it unwise to hamper in this way the growing spirit of cooperation among their
                        constituents.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>

        <p>The first constitution of the "Institute" was written by Holman. Its purpose was
                    "to promote a more general knowledge of Science, Literature, and Biblical criticism,
                    through the Baptist connection in Indiana." On January 4, 1837, Holman was invited to
                    become the principal of the school; but he declined, because his work on the federal bench, to which
                    he had recently been appointed, demanded too much of his time.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> Yet he probably
                    did more than any other person to support the school in its early years, and his death was a real
                    loss to the Baptist constituency of the state.</p>

        <p>At first there seemed to be no serious opposition to his appointment; during the recess of Congress,
                    Jackson, on September 16, 1835, about two months after Judge Parke's death, signed the
                    commission which gave Holman the office until the end of the next session of Congress. He took the
                    oath of office before Horace Bassett, a justice of the peace of <placeName>

        </p>
        <p>Holman soon realized, however, that the forces against the confirmation of his appointment were very
                    powerful. It was even feared that Jackson would not send his nomination in to the Senate. When
                    Congress convened, the fears of Holman and his friends were increased. In a letter sent from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

          </placeName> on December 19, Amos Lane wrote that Holman's opponents were charging that he
                    was an anti-Jackson man and had opposed the various measures of the administration, that he was
                    "destitute of all the necessary qualifications for the office," and that he was

        <p>It was further believed that Jackson disagreed with Holman's attitude toward slavery.

                    However, both he and his father were firm believers in eventual emancipation, at least
                        theoretically.<hi rend="sup">106</hi> But he was much more interested in the establishment of a
                    colony in Africa for ex-slaves than he was in merely giving them their freedom. He was a very active

        <p>There was still another reason why Holman came to believe that his chances of securing the federal
                    judgeship were in jeopardy. A favorite political sport in those days was the general practice of
                    name-calling. Party labels were applied rather indiscriminately, and often they meant nothing at
                    all. Much confusion resulted. Party relationship was subject to sudden and frequent changes, and men
                    were known by the name of the man they followed at the moment. With such confusion in politics, it
                    is little wonder that Holman found much opposition to his appointment.</p>
        <p>Those who were opposed to him seemed to have such influence over President Jackson that the chances
                    of sending Holman's name in to the Senate began to appear almost hopeless, and friends of
                    the judge urged him to visit <placeName>

                    the capital, he immediately learned of the political bickering in and out of Congress; and he came
                    to the conclusion that the opposition was more against his friends than against him personally. He
                    found the Indiana delegation in Congress very much at odds with each other.</p>

        <head>SOURCES OF INDIANA'S FIRST CONSTITUTION</head>
        <byline>JOHN D. BARNHART</byline>
        <p>A large part of the first constitution of the state of Indiana was copied from earlier constitutions.
                    The original portions constitute less than ten per cent of the entire document. The process of
                    writing the Indiana constitution, however, was not the simple process of copying the constitutional
                    law of another state. Nor were entire articles drawn from a single constitution as a general rule.
                    The process was a selective one. Apparently the members of the convention had before them the
                    constitutional law of the nation and of the states then in existence. They seem to have searched
                    through these documents to find the sections which embodied the provisions they considered suitable
                    for the government of the new state. Occasionally they wrote a new section when a suitable one was
                    not found. There is no reason to suppose that they were afraid of new ideas.</p>
        <p>The selective process resulted in a more democratic state government. This democratic tendency was
                    revealed in the absence of property qualifications, the extension of the franchise to adult white
                    males, representation proportioned to numbers, the prohibition of slavery and indentured servitude,
                    the election of militia officers, and the provision for a state-wide system of education, reaching
                    from township schools to a state university equally open to all, without tuition.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the constitutions of <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region reg="tnu" type="state">Tennessee</region>
          </placeName>, which were closely related to one another, contained most of the sections which were
                    taken over by Indiana. This is interesting evidence that the states of the <geogName>Ohio
                    Valley</geogName> at this time had much in common and that <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>

          </placeName> had made a considerable contribution to them. To some degree this relationship is a
                    measure of the influence of the southern migration into the Old Northwest and an indication of the
                    characteristics of that influence.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <hi rend="sup">1</hi> This comparison of the Indiana constitution of 1816 with the earlier
                        constitutions can be better evaluated by studying the migration of Southerners into the Old
                        Northwest. The following articles provide the background which this brief introduction can
                        suggest only in the briefest form: "The Southern Influence in the Formation of </item>

        <p>The following comparison of the Indiana constitution with similar provisions of other constitutions
                    affords ample opportunity to check these conclusions and, perhaps, to determine other interesting
                    facts about the establishment of state government in the Hoosier commonwealth.</p>

        <p>The text of the constitution of Indiana was taken from the manuscript copy in the Indiana State
                    Library, Indiana History Division. A second manuscript copy is in the William Henry Smith Memorial
                    Library of the Indiana Historical Society. A suitable printed copy is in Charles Kettleborough, <hi
            rend="i">Constitution Making in Indiana</hi> (3 vols., <hi rend="i">Indiana Historical
                        Collections</hi>, <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName>, 1916, 1930), I, 83–125. In this copy liberties were taken in capitalization
                    and punctuation. In respect to capitalization is might be said that it is often impossible to tell
                    whether the copyist intended a capital or a small letter.</p>
        <p>The texts of the other constitutions are taken from Francis N. Thorpe (comp.), <hi rend="i">Federal
                        and State Constitutions…and Other Organic Laws</hi>…(7 vols., <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>, 1909).</p>
        <p>The constitutions are arranged with the similar portions in parallel position to render comparison as
                    easy as possible. Wherever the right-hand column is left blank, a similar provision was not found in
                    the earlier constitutions. It is important to realize that the comparison is that of words, not
                    meaning, the purpose being to show what parts of other constitutions were copied and not what states
                    had similar governmental agencies or constitutional provisions. If the description of an agency was
                    very differently expressed in the earlier constitutions, notice was not taken of it.</p>

        <p>Someone has recently remarked that in 1492, <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
          </placeName> discovered America, while in 1942, America discovered <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>. Allowing for the figurative language, it must be conceded that this observation
                    contains considerable truth. During the past few months innumerable books and articles have appeared
                    in this country relating to <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName> and its history. This awakening of interest in our northern neighbor was long overdue.
                    Canadian historians have been diligent in research into their past and the results of their labors
                    have been available in many scholarly, if rather formidable, works. It was high time, however, that <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>'s story should be made accessible to the public in somewhat more popular form.</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="i">A Short History of <placeName>
              <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
            </placeName>, for Americans</hi> has been written in response to this increasing interest south
                    of the international boundary in Canadian affairs. Professor Burt was especially well qualified for
                    the task because of his scholarship and his familiarity with both the American and the Canadian
                    points of view. He is a Canadian by birth and has been for some years professor of history at the
                    University of <placeName>
            <region reg="mnu" type="state">Minnesota</region>
          </placeName>.</p>
        <p>The present volume is intended primarily for the general reader rather than as a textbook. It covers
                    the entire range of Canadian history, from the early French explorations to the second World War,
                    which means that at many points the narrative has had to be compressed within fairly narrow limits.
                    Professor Burt writes in a lively and interesting style and he has given us the best brief
                    introduction to Canadian history which has yet appeared. He has not limited himself to political and
                    constitutional history but has devoted considerable space to social and cultural matters.</p>
        <p>There are three excellent chapters dealing with the French regime, prior to 1763, in which the author
                    stresses the influence of the frontier element upon Canadian life and emphasizes the essentially
                    democratic outlook of the habitants. The American Revolution and the War of 1812, in so far as they
                    affected <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>, are described at some length; and there is a good account of the evolution of
                    responsible government and of the formation of the Confederation of 1867. One chapter contains an
                    excellent description of the government of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>, which will be of great value to American readers. There is a most interesting account
                    of the expansion of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName> and of life in the West and Northwest. The compression which was unavoidable in a
                    modest-sized volume is especially noticeable toward the end; and the treatment of political,
                    economic, and imperial trends since 1867 is disappointingly brief and sketchy. The reviewer feels
                    that American readers would gladly have known more of these matters.</p>

        <p>Those who have read earlier books by Professor Burt will recognize in this volume points of view
                    which are unconventional and with which they may not always agree. He refuses to concede that <pb
            id="VAA4025-039-1-098" n="96"/> concern for the fur trade had much, if anything, to do with
                    Great Britain's retention of the Northwest posts following the Revolution. In describing
                    the causes of the War of 1812 he chooses to ignore the expansionist tendencies of the American
                    frontiersmen and the demand for the conquest of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>. This factor may have been over-stressed in the past, but should it be omitted
                    altogether? In commenting on the motives which led to the founding of New <placeName>
            <country reg="fr">France</country>
          </placeName>, Professor Burt says that no English colony was established with an idea that it would
                    control a water passage through the continent to the Orient, "or with any thought of
                    discovering such a passage." Some such purpose was certainly present in the minds of the <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName> patentees. The reviewer feels that in a volume intended for American readers, a little
                    more space should have been devoted to Canadian-American diplomatic and economic relations. The
                    Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, for example, is summarized in one brief sentence. On the other hand, the
                    volume contains brief but vivid pen portraits of many of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>'s leaders, such as Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir John A. Macdonald, and Joseph
                    Howe, which make lively reading.</p>
        <p>The book is published in an unusually attractive format. The typography and printing are excellent
                    and there are end papers of most attractive design. An outstanding feature of the volume consists of
                    almost one hundred half-tone illustrations, made from historical prints, drawings, and portraits,
                    and from modern photographs. Together they serve to illustrate almost every aspect of Canadian life
                    and history. There are also a number of maps to illustrate the text. Professor Burt deserves the
                    highest praise for a work which should go a long way toward making <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName> better known to Americans. The one real regret of the reviewer is that this survey
                    could not have been twice as long. There is still room for a similar book containing considerably
                    more material, which might be used as a text in the increasing number of courses in Canadian history
                    being offered in American colleges and universities.</p>

                    is admirably prepared to tell what he terms "the story of the Great Lakes." He
                    writes with enthusiasm and most readers will come to share his feelings, even though they may not
                    care to finish the book at one sitting. It consists essentially of a series of sketches on such
                    topics as the explorations of the French, the founding of the Lake cities, the coming of the
                    immigrants, the development of lumbering and mining—all loosely joined together by a
                    history of transportation. Mr. Havighurst has found time as a professor of English at Miami
                    University, <placeName>

          </placeName>, to supplement his earlier activities as seaman and longshoreman by diligent research.
                    Thus competently, but on a popular level, he revives many dramatic episodes, such as <pb
            id="VAA4025-039-1-099" n="97"/> the fleet that sailed on land, the building of the Soo Canal (which
                    carries "more tonnage than the <placeName>
            <country reg="pn">Panama</country>
          </placeName>, Suez, and Kiel canals all together"), the burning of Menominee, etc.</p>
        <p>Although ships hold the center of the stage, the reader catches glimpses of Brule, Nicolet,
                    Marquette, Joliet, Allouez, La Salle, and Schoolcraft. Paradoxically, it is the nineteenth century
                    names which are unfamiliar. How many Hoosiers will recall Douglas Houghton, of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
          </placeName>, a contemporary of Schoolcraft, the Indian agent! Or the Mormon, James Jesse Strang,
                    known as the "King of Beaver Island" and by other titles far less complimentary!
                    Then there was George Stuntz, pioneer of the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Duluth</settlement>
          </placeName> area, who early regarded the Superior region as the "future heart of the
                    continent" (quite in contrast to Henry <placeName>
            <region type="county">Clay</region>
          </placeName>, who objected to a prospective canal at the Soo because it was "a place beyond
                    the remotest settlement of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>, if not in the moon"). Fleeting attention is accorded such captains as George
                    McKay, Charley Allers, and Tom Wilson (not to mention "Sockless" Jerry Simpson,
                    who seldom is associated with the Lakes) and boat builders like Alexander McDougall, James Davidson,
                    George A. Tomlinson, and Harry Coulby.</p>
        <p>Some one hundred sixty vessels are mentioned by name, beginning with the pioneer steamer
                    "Walk-in-the-Water," which by means of sails and forty cords of hardwood made a
                    trip in three days from the <geogName>Hudson River</geogName> to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
          </placeName>. While the tragedy of the "Caroline" in 1837 is commonly known today,
                    almost equally famous in their time were the disasters encountered by the
                    "Phoenix," the "<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
          </placeName>," the "G. P. Griffin," the "Charles F.
                    Price," and the "Lady Elgin." All types of craft are dealt with, but one
                    has a suspicion that Mr. Havighurst is partial to such full-rigged schooners as the "Lucia
                    A. Simpson," which flourished from 1875 to 1929, the last of its kind. The concluding
                    chapter recapitulates briefly the Great Lakes-to-ocean project, of which many readers probably would
                    prefer a little fuller treatment, even at the expense of a score of
                    "three-masters" and iron freighters.</p>

        <p>Joseph Lane, "Jo" to most people, is remembered in the Hoosier state chiefly for
                    his exploits in the Mexican War as Brigadier-General of the Indiana Brigade of Volunteers. He is
                    remembered in <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> as territorial governor, Indian fighter, delegate to Congress, and senator. And he is
                    known to the people of the country chiefly as running mate of John C. Breckinridge on the national
                    Democratic ticket in the fire-eating campaign of 1860.</p>
        <p>"Jo" Lane—frontiersman, <placeName>
            <region reg="msu" type="state">Mississippi</region>

          </placeName> boatman, soldier, politician, Forty-Niner, farmer, Catholic—has long
                    deserved the full-fledged biographical treatment accorded him by Sister M. Margaret Jean Kelly in
                    what was her doctoral dissertation at the Catholic University of America. The author's
                    treatment of Lane is very creditable, in that she has sketched with good balance and proportion the
                    life of <pb
            id="VAA4025-039-1-100" n="98"/> Lane, from his birth in Buncombe County, <placeName>
            <region reg="ncu" type="state">North Carolina</region>
          </placeName>, in 1801 to his death at Roseburg, <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName>, in 1881. She pictures Joseph, a lad of fourteen, as a clerk in a drygoods store at
                    Darlington, Indiana; as a married man at nineteen; and as state legislator at Corydon at twenty-one.
                    When war with <placeName>
            <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
          </placeName> came in May, 1846, Lane left the State Senate to volunteer as a private in the Indiana
                    Riflemen of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Vanderburgh County</region>
          </placeName>. But thanks to the influence of a loyal friend, Robert Owen, President Polk presently
                    elevated Lane to be Brigadier-General of the Indiana Brigade. Lane saw much action on Mexican soil.
                    During the Battle of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Buena Vista</settlement>
          </placeName>, in which engagement the Hoosier Colonel William H. Bowles gave an order to
                    "Cease firing and retreat," General Lane was credited by a court of inquiry with
                    having "conducted himself as a brave and gallant officer."</p>
        <p>Lane was a good Democrat with ingrown southern leanings, and President Polk rewarded the returned
                    hero—now often alluded to as the "<placeName>
            <region type="county">Marion</region>
          </placeName> of the Mexican War"—with the territorial governorship of <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName>. The author's treatment of Lane's <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> experiences is one based more solidly on documentary materials, thanks to the
                    availability of about 2,000 letters to and from Lane for the period after 1848 that are housed at
                    the <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> Historical Society at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
          </placeName>. The author is inclined to be friendly to and at times apologetic for her subject, but
                    she has woven in materials that suggest varying degrees of approbation and blame. While in <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> Territory, Lane helped to form and perpetuate a Democratic clique that retained him as <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName>'s representative first in the House and then in the Senate until the eclipse
                    of his party in 1860. And so strong was his influence in the <geogName>Willamette Valley</geogName>
                    that when the ballots of that year were counted, <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> gave <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
          </placeName> 5,344 votes; Breckinridge, 5,074; and Douglas, who led over Breckinridge in all other
                    northern states, only 212 votes.</p>
        <p>Finally, the author tells the story of Lane's forced retirement to his farm near Roseburg,
                    that came as a result of the Republican triumph and the Civil War, but how as years passed by the
                    public condemnation for his southern sympathies softened toward the aging warrior—so much
                    so that, with Dr. John McLoughlin, he is remembered as one of a pair of <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName>'s grand old men.</p>

        <p>The full and classified bibliography in this book shows some omissions. There is no listing of
                    earlier biographical sketches of Joseph Lane, such as the one by Eldora Miner Raleigh which appeared

        <p>The style of the book is clear and readable, but not particularly colorful. The text has been
                    prepared with evident care, but some <pb
            id="VAA4025-039-1-101" n="99"/> misstatements and
                    typographical errors have crept in, as, for example, the date April 24, 1847, given as the date of
                    the opening of hostility between the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
          </placeName> (p. 25) ; a "41–174" vote in the Senate (p. 61) which, if
                    true, would admit of some ballot box stuffing; "man" for men (p. 9) ;
                    "Mexirans" for Mexicans (p. 42) ; "though" for thought (p. 70),
                    "Port <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>
          </placeName>" for Port Orford (p. 139) ; and throughout she refers to the Hudson's
                    Bay Company as "Hudson Bay Company" (as for example on pages 70, 71, and in the
                    index). It is doubtful, however, that any of these errors of omission and commission have seriously
                    impaired the value of this biography—a very welcome contribution to western history.</p>

        <p>This volume is the latest biography of William Henry Harrison. It is an interesting and spirited
                    account of the career of Indiana's territorial governor, but it has many shortcomings. It
                    certainly is far from a definitive account and is not likely to be regarded as an improvement upon
                    Dorothy B. Goebel's political biography of Harrison, which Mr. Green criticizes as too
                    unfriendly.</p>
        <p>It pictures the young soldier as he came from <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName> to the frontier of the early Northwest Territory, where he learned Indian warfare under
                    the direction of General Anthony <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wayne</region>
          </placeName>. He later became the delegate to Congress from the territory, as a result of his
                    association with other Virginians in their struggle against Governor Arthur St. Clair. This
                    position, in turn, led to his appointment as governor of Indiana Territory in 1800. A very erroneous
                    conception of the land system and of the Harrison Land Act of 1800 (pp. 79–80) mars this
                    portion of the work. Praise of Harrison in this connection is considerably exaggerated. The <placeName>
            <region reg="msu" type="state">Mississippi</region>
          </placeName> Territory is also confused with the Southwest Territory (p. 70).</p>
        <p>His administration as governor of Indiana Territory is described in a fairly brief chapter, in which
                    the author rightly complains that not enough attention has been paid to the cultural influences of
                    Harrison in the <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName> and in which he admits the error of the governor
                    in favoring the introduction of slavery. He fails, however, to deal with the contest between the
                    friends and opponents of Harrison and the resulting democratization of the territorial government
                    and the movement for statehood. This omission freed the author from the treatment of contemporary
                    criticism of his hero.</p>
        <p>His military career is delineated at much greater length. Here the author finds much to admire and
                    little to criticize. Slight attention is devoted to Harrison's efforts to have himself
                    placed in command of the army in the Northwest. Partisanship for Harrison involves the author in a
                    hostile treatment of General James <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Winchester</settlement>

          </placeName> (p. 154). Although many pages are devoted to the campaign of 1813, the reader is likely
                    to secure a picture not so much of military operations as of camp life and of the problems of
                    supplying the army. <pb
            id="VAA4025-039-1-102" n="100"/> An interesting and instructive diary which
                    is quoted at length almost obscures the general and the campaign.</p>
        <p>Resigning from the army, Harrison entered upon the life of a country gentleman and farmer,
                    establishing his home at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">North Bend</settlement>
          </placeName>. He was often busy with official duties, for he was a member of Congress,
                    1816–1819, of the state senate, 1819–1821, and of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> Senate, 1825–1828. He also served as <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> minister to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
          </placeName>, 1828–1829. The author gives generous glimpses of Harrison's home
                    life, his farming activity, and his brief diplomatic career. After a few years of farming and local
                    politics, Harrison emerged as an unsuccessful candidate for President. In. this portion of the
                    narrative, one learns that the author shares Harrison's hostility to Jackson (p. 275).
                    Hostility to Harrison's critics brings forth the remark that one is an unfriendly
                    biographer (p. 256) and another a "glorious ass" (p. 294). Poor proofreading is
                    apparent throughout the book, but here one finds "skin plasters" for
                    "shinplasters" (p. 310).</p>
        <p>The remainder of the narrative is devoted to the campaign for the presidential nomination of the Whig
                    party, the succeeding campaign for the election of 1840, the journey to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName>, and the month in which Harrison was an occupant of the White House. A concluding
                    chapter treats the myth of the log cabin.</p>
        <p>The narrative concerning the political contests is always lively and interesting, but the author
                    appears bewildered when following the President-elect to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> and during his brief presidency. He is loyal to his subject to the very end, however,
                    finding in the conduct of others a sufficient field for his critical activity. Occasional slips also
                    mar this part of the work. The Whitewater Canal is said to link <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName> with <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
          </placeName> (p. 315). The Mexican War is referred to as adding to the Union the territory from the
                    Rio Grande to the British possessions on the north (p. 343). When pioneers were able to build a new
                    home to take the place of the log cabin, "the new house" was "usually of
                    brick, sometimes of stone and not infrequently of frame [p. 344]." James G. Birney is
                    described as "the first and greatest of the abolitionists [p. 353]."</p>
        <p>A lengthy appendix reveals a considerable knowledge of the literature about Harrison. Careless
                    proofreading is evident in the first paragraph, however, where Dr. Logan Esarey quickly becomes
                    "Dr. Esrey." The author evidently was not aware of the old adage that
                    "persons who live in glass houses should not throw stones," for he criticizes
                    others rather freely, though often correctly. The author also reveals that he possesses and has read
                    120 Harrison sermons and funeral orations. His collection of Harrison titles has reached 1600.</p>
        <p>It is only fair to the author and to his prospective readers to say that he has produced a very
                    interesting book, that it contains many excellent illustrations, and that for many readers its

        <p>There is always room for another volume of historical fiction which appeals to the
                    juvenile's love of adventure, especially when it combines with this appeal the substance
                    that makes for fair-mindedness and demonstrates to youth the all-pervading power of the human
                    spirit. Written by the author of <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
              <region type="county">Wabash</region>
            </placeName>
          </hi> and <hi rend="i">Big Knife: The Story of George Rogers Clark</hi>, this volume
                    becomes a welcome addition to junior high school literature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's treatment of the relations of the white men and Indians is admirably fair. As
                    battles are described one notes the author's efforts to bring out the courage of both
                    frontiersmen and red men. In his story of their diplomatic dealings, particularly those of William
                    Henry Harrison and Tecumseh, there is a studied attempt to justify the attitudes and actions of each
                    in the light of their contrasting backgrounds. The author emphasizes that many Indian tribes,
                    particularly the Piankeshaws around <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
          </placeName>, had been corrupted by the white man's "fire-water"; but he
                    also describes how men of the two races exhibited profound respect and genuine helpfulness toward
                    each other.</p>
        <p>From the opening pages, which tell how the hero received the name Tecumseh—Shawnee for
                    Shooting Star—the reader senses the atmosphere in which the Indians lived at the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century. There are incidental but excellent pictures of Indian and
                    frontier home life, with its simple entertainment and unsophisticated humor, of the Osages who were
                    at home in the saddle and the Shawnees who were fleet of foot, and of Indian military tactics.</p>
        <p>Tecumseh stands out above ail other characters. Perhaps the best picture of this great
                    chief's heroic proportions is afforded in a little incident which dramatically interrupts
                    the swiftly moving story of preparations for the fatal Battle of the Thames. As Tecumseh stood at
                    dawn talking for the last time to his son, a frontier lad who had run many miles from his home that
                    morning just to see this famed chief was so impressed by the fine figure that had been so often
                    described to him and "the face that reminded men somehow of Napoleon" that years
                    later he named his own son Tecumseh, in memory of that hero whom he had seen but for a moment on
                    that October morning in 1813. Mr. Wilson presents his hero as a man of patience, foresight, and
                    loyalty—loyalty even to those for whom he had lost all personal respect but to whom he
                    was bound by agreement. The adult, incidentally, might consider the narrative here a bit overdrawn
                    and sentimental; but to the youthful mind the story of these trying days in Tecumseh's life
                    leads only to an increased appreciation of his stature as a man.</p>
        <p>The style and the organization of <hi rend="i">Shooting Star</hi> are as a whole very commendable.
                    Only in a few spots is the vividness and clarity of the writing marred by a difficult vocabulary and
                    involved sentences. The story displays a fine unity throughout, and yet some chapters are so well
                    self-contained as to constitute excellent short stories.</p>
        <p>A number of famous historical characters march across the pages <pb id="VAA4025-039-1-104" n="102"/>
                    of the book, such as Admiral Perry and Mad Anthony <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wayne</region>
          </placeName>. As to Tecumseh himself, he fails to become in the latter part of <hi rend="i">Shooting
                        Star</hi> the great warrior of <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName>, as he is so often pictured. In fact, his career as a military giant seems to suffer
                    from the effect of an anticlimax soon after he finally abandoned the Indian territory. But perhaps
                    this is only a way of preparing the reader for the hero's final triumph as the embodiment
                    of "the ideal of freedom and human dignity—that ideal for which Tecumseh lived
                    and fought in the <placeName>

          </placeName>, in

            <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
          </placeName>. Thomas and John Atkinson, brothers, were born in Yorkshire, <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England</country>
          </placeName>, the sons of John Atkinson. These brothers emigrated to <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName> in 1681, where they were among the founders of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Bucks County</region>

          </placeName>. The head of this branch was William, who married Elizabeth Curtis. Descendants of this
                    family moved westward, and Atkinsons are found in many western and southern states. The family whose
