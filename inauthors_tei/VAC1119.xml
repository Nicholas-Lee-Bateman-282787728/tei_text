				<head rend="center">PREFACE</head>

				<p>The Great War has left the world in an unstable condition. Bonds uniting society have
					been strained, if not weakened. Dangerous forces have organized for assault upon existing
					social order.</p>
				<p>At this psychological moment, a radical change in the American system of Government is
					taking place. Millions of new women voters, it appears, are about to cast their first
					ballots. It is of critical importance that voters should clearly understand and loyally
					support the principles which constitute sound Americanism. These principles are under
					attack. False prophets have arisen, and, taking advantage of the world's unrest, seek to
					lead us from the paths of true progress into the byways of reckless experiment.</p>
				<p>The words "Reconstruction" and "Reconstruction Policy" are heard on all sides. They have
					no just application to America. There can be no reconstruction until there has first been
					destruction. The words do apply to Northern France, with her ruined cities, leveled
					factories, flooded mines and shell-torn fields. They apply to Germany and Austria, where
					ancient political systems have been disrupted. They apply to Russia, where an entire
					civilization, <pb id="VAC1119-006" n="[6]"/> its laws, its institutions, its traditions,
					have been destroyed. But America, in the Providence of God, needs no reconstruction. What
					she does need is Rededication&mdash;the Rededication of her people to those principles
					which have made America great and have kept America free.</p>
				<p>This book, with the foregoing point of view, will, it is hoped, be of practical benefit
					to beginners in the study of public affairs.</p>

							rend="sc">ECESSITY</hi></head>
					<p>Government of some kind is a necessity for a civilized people. In the nature of things,
						it is requisite that authority be lodged in some person or persons to make and enforce
						rules governing the conduct and relations of human beings. If a man lived like Robinson
						Crusoe alone on a desert island, no Government would be necessary, but when more than
						one person is present, and increasingly as the population grows, conflicting interests
						and reciprocal duties arise. Men and women can not safely be left to decide what duties
						they owe one another. They can not be left entirely free to defend their own rights, for
						this is likely to lead to violence and the rule of might rather than of right. All human
						experience tends to support the statement that there must be Government, with authority
						to make and enforce rules of conduct for <pb id="VAC1119-014" n="14"/> human beings. In
						no other way can peace, security and civilization be attained or preserved.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL CAPACITY</head>
						<p>Races and peoples differ greatly in their capacity to organize and maintain
							Government. It may truthfully be said that the rise and fall of civilizations, of
							nations, of states and of cities have often been determined, and have always been
							powerfully influenced, by their capacity for organizing Government and supporting its
							authority. The difference between the United States and Mexico, her nearest neighbor,
							illustrates the difference between a people such as ours possessing very great
							aptitude for the formation and maintenance of settled Government, and of a people
							almost without such aptitude. Mexico and the United States were discovered and settled
							about the same time. The Mexican Republic secured its independence from Spain as early
							as 1821. Since that time its constitution has, at least until lately, been very
							similar to the Constitution of the United States. Yet, while our nation has grown
							until it is probably the most powerful, and certainly the most prosperous and happy,
							on the face of the earth, the career of Mexico has been one succession of bloody
							revolutions, marked by violence and lawlessness, by robbery and murder, with only <pb
								id="VAC1119-015" n="15"/> one substantial interval of peace and prosperity. The
							difference between the two countries is the result of the difference between the
							capacities of their peoples for the formation of Government and submission to its
							authority.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ANARCHISTS' DENIAL OF FOREGOING TRUTHS</head>
						<p>It would seem that the foregoing statements are so plainly true as to be self-evident
							to every intelligent person, and one would suppose that they would not be questioned.
							Strange as it may appear, these truths are denied, particularly in the present time,
							by considerable numbers of persons in every civilized country. In the first place,
							they are denied by anarchists, those dangerous individuals, who declare that neither
							Government nor law is necessary or right. They assert that every man and every woman
							should be free at all times to do whatever seems desirable. Now it is not strange that
							such distorted and dangerous opinions should be held in countries whose peoples have
							suffered long oppression and cruel injustice at the hands of their Governments. Russia
							is the country where we would most likely find anarchy cherished and praised by
							multitudes of embittered persons, and Russia is indeed the very source of modern
							anarchistic thought. Yet anarchists are found in every <pb id="VAC1119-016" n="16"/>
							country, even in America. They are usually foreigners who have suffered under their
							own Governments and, having come to America, have failed to appreciate its advantages
							or the free gifts which it offers them. On the contrary, they hold the same hatred for
							our republic, its Constitution and laws, which they did for old-world despotism. In
							their ignorance they are determined to destroy our Government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section sc">
						<head rend="center sc">ANARCHISTS IN AMERICA</head>
						<p>Not all American anarchists are of foreign birth. Some native-born citizens of this
							republic have been infected with the disease, but generally the anarchist who goes
							about lecturing, organizing or writing in the interest of violent anarchy, of bomb
							throwing, of murder and of pillage will be found to be of foreign birth. But we do
							find a class of American anarchists of an entirely different sort. Men and women of
							respectable lives and positions, even professors in our great universities, are to be
							found who hold that the State and Government as we know them are unnecessary and evil.
							Some of them declare that sovereignty, which is the supreme power to make and enforce
							laws, exists, not in the whole people, but in different groups. It is said that the
							trade union may, for its members, have a <pb id="VAC1119-017" n="17"/> sort of
							sovereignty, a claim on their obedience, superior to that of the State. In other
							words, there is a disposition among certain intellectuals to abolish the central
							authority of the State, and to substitute the authority of groups. It should seem
							plain to every person of common sense that these groups, whether they be trade unions,
							churches, secret societies or any other association, will certainly fall to fighting
							one another, will destroy order and security, and in this way, if not by bomb
							throwing, reach the same result as the avowed anarchist unless they are held in check
							by the supreme and sovereign authority of the State.</p>
						<p>The third source of the anarchistic movement to weaken or destroy the authority of
							Government is the mob spirit. We are all too familiar with accounts of brutal
							lynchings, race riots and acts of violence in support of strikes. All these crimes
							tend, and are in fact designed, to overthrow law and order and the power of
							Government, at least for the time being. They are therefore distinctly anarchistic.
							Even though the object be local and temporary, the effect of such violence and
							outrage, if the Government were unable or unwilling to check and control them, would
							sooner or later be either to overthrow the Government directly or so to weaken it that
							it would fall of its own weight. In fact it may be <pb id="VAC1119-018" n="18"/>
							truthfully said that every violation of law, every crime, is an attempt to overthrow
							public authority, and is of the essential nature of anarchy, from which it can be
							distinguished only by the fact that the crime of a single burglar, assailant or
							murderer, is limited in scope because directed against a very small number of
							persons.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SUPPORT OF LAW AND ORDER</head>
						<p>The foregoing fundamental principles constitute the basis of Government, and have
							been stated in sufficient fulness to bring us to the very practical point that it is
							the duty of every patriotic voter to cast his ballot in favor of the authority of
							Government, the enforcement of law and order and the security and strengthening of the
							State. It is easy enough for any intelligent person to recognize the crime of anarchy
							when it consists of such an act of violence as the placing of a bomb in a crowded
							building with a view to destroying the structure and the persons who are lawfully in
							it. Every good man or woman will instantly resolve in favor of laws for the punishment
							of such crimes, and will vote for legislators who will enact such laws, judges who
							will apply them, governors, mayors, sheriffs and all other executive officers from
							president to policeman, who will at every cost, and at every peril <pb
								id="VAC1119-019" n="19"/> to themselves fearlessly seek out and punish the
							criminals.</p>
						<p>It is not quite so easy to realize that the members of a mob, impatient instantly to
							bring swift and sure punishment to some guilty criminal, who force a jail or burn a
							court-house and, after securing their victim, hang him to a tree, should, in the very
							nature of things, be identified and punished in order to prevent other mobs. Yet this
							is undoubtedly true. If Government survives in spite of these things it is only
							because, so far, the reign of violence and lawlessness is local and sporadic. Whenever
							such proceedings become frequent or general, our republic will be overthrown, for it
							will receive neither the respect nor the support of its citizens.</p>
						<p>Likewise, in the case of labor troubles, with acts of violence in support of
							strikers, it may often be that the strikers have a just cause with which our people
							sympathize; yet even in such cases violence and terrorism must be repressed with a
							stern hand and punished. The whole force of the Government, all the wealth and all the
							lives of this country, must be mobilized to maintain law and order regardless of
							whether the disturbance may be intended to aid a just cause or not.</p>
						<p>Still another form of disguised anarchy, camouflaged with appearances of patriotism
							and love of <pb id="VAC1119-020" n="20"/> liberty, appeared in this country during the
							war with Germany. Agitators and pro-Germans, as well as pacifists, urged our young men
							not to join the army. A great captain of industry, a very able business man but a very
							ignorant and foolish citizen, was accused of describing professional soldiers as
							murderers. A great newspaper called him an anarchist. The question whether this
							description of the man was correct was submitted to a jury. The plaintiff, the captain
							of industry who had sued for a million dollars damages, received a verdict in his
							favor of only six cents.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY</head>
						<p>The principle involved in these various illustrations of private conduct, which is
							subversive and anarchistic, tending to weaken the authority of Government, is plain.
							It is that if the right be conceded to one person or group of persons to judge whether
							law should be observed or not, whether the Government should be resisted or supported,
							then the same right must be conceded equally to every other citizen. Once admit the
							existence of such a right, and we arrive at anarchy itself, which is the absence of
							binding law and of governmental authority.</p>
						<p>Therefore the first and highest obligation which <pb id="VAC1119-021" n="21"/> rests
							upon the voter who possesses the right to have a voice in public affairs, is to
							scrutinize every question with a view to determine whether it involves the
							strengthening or weakening of Government, and carefully to consider every platform,
							every principle which is being urged, in order to determine whether, openly and
							directly, or secretly and indirectly, their effect, if carried out, would be to weaken
							the principle of authority in this country. Finally, every candidate for office should
							be sternly judged, as to whether he will, without fear, defend the State and public
							order, no matter what the peril to himself.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">FAMOUS INSTANCES IN AMERICAN HISTORY</head>
						<p>Before concluding this topic, I propose to cite a few famous instances, in the
							history of the United States, which show the difference between the brave and
							patriotic exercise of governmental authority, and the contemptible and treasonable
							failure to exercise such authority. In I86o James Buchanan, President of the United
							States, found himself facing a rebellion of the Southern States, which, if successful,
							meant the destruction of the Union. In such a crisis, the supreme executive, charged
							by his oath of office with the duty, and invested by the Constitution with the powers
							to defend, preserve and protect the authority of the National Government, <pb
								id="VAC1119-022" n="22"/> declared himself to be without the power to do so. He
							weakly submitted to the secession of Southern States, and to acts of rebellion against
							the authority of the nation, which had elected him president. On March 4, 1861,
							Abraham Lincoln took the oath of office as Buchanan's successor, and, facing the
							dangers confronting the nation, with unflinching courage raised armies and undertook
							by every means within his power to defeat and overthrow the rebellion, and preserve
							intact the supreme authority of the National Government. Buchanan would have let the
							nation be destroyed. Lincoln preserved it.</p>
						<p>Again, in 1894, at the time of the Pullman strike, Chicago was attacked by mobs,
							train service was interrupted, mail trains stopped and a general reign of lawless
							violence inaugurated in support of a strike by the employees of the Pullman Company,
							against a reduction of wages. The governor of Illinois, Altgeld, in spite of the fact
							that the police and militia were utterly unsuccessful in quelling disorder, refused to
							make the usual call upon the president of the United States, for Federal troops. For
							this infamous neglect of duty, Altgeld has been called "the friend and champion of
							disorder." He protested against the sending of United States troops to Chicago, and
							when they came, demanded <pb id="VAC1119-023" n="23"/> their withdrawal. In marked
							contrast with this failure to defend the authority of Government, President Cleveland,
							with instant resolution and courage, secured an injunction against interference with
							the mails and interstate commerce by the strikers in the Federal courts at Chicago.
							The president sent regular troops to the scene. In a short time order was restored and
							the guilty leaders of the outbreak found themselves in prison. President Cleveland is
							reported to have said that "if it took every dollar in the treasury and every soldier
							in the United States Army to deliver a postal card in Chicago, that postal card should
							be delivered." At the height of the disturbance a resolution was introduced in the
							United States Senate, directing that Federal courts should not prevent the obstruction
							of trains, except that part of the train which carried mails. Senator Cushman K.
							Davis, a Republican from Minnesota, being asked by the railway union to support the
							resolution replied, "You might as well ask me to vote to dissolve the Government."</p>
						<p>American history is rich in illustrations of the courageous defense of authority by
							public officials of high and low station. Unhappily, it is not without incidents of
							the opposite kind. Hence, every voter, man or woman, must choose whether to stand on
							the side of authority, of law and of order, or upon <pb id="VAC1119-024" n="24"/> the
							side of those who would undermine the Government, defy its authority and destroy the
							peace, order and security of person and property for the protection of which our
							Government was founded.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OLDER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT</head>
						<p>In order to appreciate our American system, it is necessary to understand the kind of
							Government that prevailed in the world for thousands of years before the Declaration
							of Independence. It was, with few important exceptions, absolute despotism. The whole
							power of the State was vested in one person, the monarch. Whatever he was called, king
							or emperor, sultan or czar, the monarch was the State. In modern times, hundreds of
							wars have been fought to destroy despotism. England led the way in these struggles for
							freedom. In the year 1215, her great nobles succeeded in limiting the power of the
							king, by the provisions of Magna Charta, to which they forced King John to agree. From
							that date English history records a steady advance toward free representative
							institutions. Power taken from the monarch at first belonged to the barons, and then
							was gradually transferred to a larger and ever larger portion of the people. However,
							prior to 1776, very few Englishmen had the right to vote, and the king was not obliged
							to shape <pb id="VAC1119-028" n="28"/> his policies in accordance with the views of
							the House of Commons. During the nineteenth century, the basis for suffrage in Great
							Britain was gradually broadened. During the World War, which commenced in 1914, the
							British Parliament finally abolished all property qualifications for suffrage. Every
							male citizen over twenty-one years of age, and many women, were given the right to
							vote.</p>
						<p>The story of the rise of constitutional Government and representative institutions in
							Great Britain is one of the most brilliant pages of history, but it stands alone.
							Prior to 1776 the world may have been making progress, but the almost universal form
							of Government was that of absolute despotism.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="cener sc">AMERICA FAR IN ADVANCE</head>
						<p>The soil of North America has been comparatively free from despotism. American
							colonies for the most part had liberal charters and were far too remote from Europe to
							permit of any very active interference in their affairs. The circumstances of their
							situation encouraged the desire for independence and self-government in their
							territories. On July 4, 1776, thirteen British Colonies revolted, by issuing their
							Declaration of Independence. On that day, occurred the true birth of what Lincoln
							later described as "Government of the people, for the people, by the people."</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-029" n="29"/>

						<p>At first there did exist in the colonies and states some very modest limitations of
							the right of suffrage, which had been borrowed from the mother country. Very early the
							movement for universal manhood suffrage began. By the year 1830, or over eighty-five
							years in advance of Great Britain, all property qualifications of the right to vote
							had been abolished in the United States. For generations, therefore, suffrage, the
							right to have a voice in Government, has belonged equally to every white male citizen
							of the United States, over the age of twenty-one. During the Civil War, or rather as a
							result of it, the right to vote was extended to colored men. Now the day seems at
							hand, when women, equally with men, will go to the polls and take their just share and
							responsibility in the conduct of Government and the choice of representatives.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN SYSTEM</head>
						<p>Upon the broad and firm basis of the sovereignty of the people, just described, has
							been erected the structure of American Government. It is not within the scope of this
							book to describe our Government in detail. It is important for every voter to realize
							that certain definite political principles are embodied in our system. Many of those
							principles are old, many are new. The whole taken together, both old <pb
								id="VAC1119-030" n="30"/> and new, constitutes the body of political principles
							which we and all the world as well recognize as distinctive and different from
							anything which has gone before.</p>
						<p>The principle of universal manhood suffrage came to us from France, where it was
							advocated by Rousseau, to be later adopted by the French Revolutionary Government. The
							principle of representative Government came to us from England. The two principles
							taken together were firmly laid by our forefathers, as the foundation stones of the
							American Commonwealth, held together by the cement of a written Constitution.</p>
						<p>Representative Government is obviously necessary for the success of Democracy. The
							people of a country the size of ours can not meet in one great assembly and govern
							directly by a vote of the whole people upon every measure. This was feasible in the
							days of the New England town meeting. It is not so with a great nation. The history of
							England and of the American Colonies taught our forefathers that if the people rule
							successfully, they must do it through their chosen representatives. In this way
							Government could be made practicable and efficient, through its commitment to a small
							number of persons chosen by the people and charged with definite duties. Furthermore,
							representative Government is <pb id="VAC1119-031" n="31"/> in line with the division
							of labor. Certain persons are chosen for Government work; the rest of the people go
							about their business. Men do not make their own clothes in this day and generation.
							They select the material, decide on color, weight and general style, but the carrying
							out of the order is left to the tailor. So with Government; the people decide in a
							general way on what they want; the rest is left rightfully to their
							representatives.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">POWERS OF GOVERNMENT STRICTLY LIMITED</head>
						<p>Our forefathers not only hated despotism and tyranny in its open, avowed and
							unblushing forms, but they knew that it was even more dangerous when concealed under
							an appearance of popular Government. They realized that, even under the forms of a
							republic, and under the semblance of the rule of the people, tyranny, despotism and
							personal sovereignty, might all too easily find their way into American institutions.
							For this reason they determined strictly to limit the powers of their Government and
							of those persons whom the people should elect to office.</p>
						<p>James Madison, fourth president of the United States, gave clear expression to one
							aspect of this matter when he warned against tyranny of majorities in the following
							words: "Wherever the real <pb id="VAC1119-032" n="32"/> power of Government lies there
							is danger of oppression. In our Government the real power lies in the majority of the
							community, and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended not from
							acts of Government contrary to the sense of the constituents, but from acts in which
							the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of constituents...... Where
							there is an interest and the power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done, and not
							the less readily by a powerful and interested party than by a powerful and interested
							prince."</p>
						<p>The American system of Government was the first to be based upon a written
							Constitution. This enabled its authors to define the extent and the limits of power of
							the Government, and its various officers. The Constitution, being the supreme law of
							the land, needs only to be enforced, in order to prevent tyranny of any form from
							gaining entrance to American political life.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS</head>
						<p>The authors of the Constitution, being informed by history, knew that there were
							certain things which were to be dreaded at the hands of Government, and therefore such
							wrongs were strictly prohibited. For instance they knew, only too well, the danger
							that citizens might be arrested unjustly by the agents of Government. They might be
							held in <pb id="VAC1119-033" n="33"/> confinement without a hearing in court for an
							indefinite time, and they might, by an arbitrary decree of the executive, be sent to
							prison, or even to death. Complete protection against such outrages is afforded by the
							Constitution, for we find in it provisions which preserve the right to a speedy and
							public trial by an impartial jury, while the accused has the right to know the charge
							against him, to be confronted by the prosecuting witnesses and to have the help of
							counsel.</p>
						<p>Our forefathers also knew how the history of European states had been darkened by
							cruel punishments. Numbers of the wisest and best men of England had been burnt alive
							at the stake, by decree of court, for no other crime than heresy. Torture in a
							thousand forms had been resorted to, both in war and peace. Against this the
							Constitution safeguards us by prohibiting "cruel and unusual punishments."</p>
						<p>So, too, the Constitution protects religious liberty, and freedom of speech and of
							the press. The various states of the Union are prohibited from passing any law that
							would impair the obligation of contracts. The Constitution of the United States, and
							the Constitutions of the various states are referred to, without giving more space
							here to this class of limitations on the powers of Government.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-034" n="34"/>

					<div3 type="center">
						<head rend="center sc">FURTHER CHECKS ON THE GOVERNMENT</head>
						<p>Besides specific prohibitions, above referred to, the American Constitution was so
							drawn as to prevent the vesting of too much power in any one person, or in any body of
							persons. Government was divided into three separate branches, possessing independent
							powers and duties, each intended to serve as a check against abuse of powers by the
							others. Legislative power, that is the right to enact laws, is vested in Congress.
							Congress is divided into two bodies, the Senate and House of Representatives. No
							measure can become law until it has passed both Houses of Congress. This procedure of
							course involves delay, debate and discussion. Parliamentary Government always has, in
							the nature of things, such characteristics. It is, as the word implies, Government by
							parley, or by discussion. The Senate and House have been called "the cup and saucer of
							the Constitution." As tea, in the fashion of olden days, was often poured from cup to
							saucer, in order to cool the beverage before it was drunk, so legislation passing from
							one branch of Congress to the other gives opportunity for excitement to cool, and for
							sober second thought to have its way. Under a popular Government, it is most important
							for the people to know what is going on if their wishes are <pb id="VAC1119-035"
								n="35"/> to influence Government policy. The double-chambered Congress is the best
							guarantee of publicity that has been invented.</p>
						<p>The executive power of Government, the power to carry on the business and enforce the
							laws enacted by Congress, is vested in the president, He has a checking power against
							Congress, in that he may veto any act, which can not then become law unless it is
							again passed by both Houses of Congress, and this time by a two-thirds vote. On the
							other hand, as Congress has the power to levy taxes and appropriate money, it may, if
							it see fit, put compelling pressure upon the president. , Besides this, the Senate
							must confirm all presidential appointments to office, of ambassadors, judges and other
							officers named, as well as those whose confirmation is required under statutory
							provisions. The president may make treaties with foreign Governments, but only "by and
							with the advice and consent of the Senate."</p>
						<p>The president is commander-in-chief of the army and navy, but Congress alone can
							authorize the creation of either, and, by granting or withholding appropriations, can
							exercise such control over the armed forces of the United States as may serve to
							prevent an abuse of power by the commander-in-chief.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-036" n="36"/>
						<p> It must be realized that this system of dividing power between president and
							Congress, can only be effective in creating reciprocal checks upon the abuse of power,
							by either branch, where the independent judgment of the president and of Congress is
							actually exercised. If, through intimidation or any other improper course, the
							president should come to control Congress so that its approval of his policies would
							be automatic, without the exercise of critical judgment and patriotic courage, our
							Government would rapidly become one of autocratic personal sovereignty. So also, if
							Congress, possessing the power to withhold appropriations and even to impeach the
							president and remove him from office, should so coerce him that the executive ceased
							to exercise the full constitutional authority conferred upon him for the public good,
							the purpose of the Constitution would be defeated, and the country would be apt to
							suffer many, or all, of the evils arising from feeble administration and lax
							enforcement of public law.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</head>
						<p>The most distinctive feature of the American Constitution is its assignment of
							judicial power to the third branch of the Government. Legislatures of the various
							states of the Union, and Congress <pb id="VAC1119-037" n="37"/> itself, may enact
							laws, and the Acts of Congress may have been signed by the president, or passed over
							his veto, but it does not follow that any of these acts constitute valid law. All are
							still subject to the consideration and decision of the courts, and finally of the
							Supreme Court of the United States. It is the duty of that august tribunal, not merely
							to interpret and apply the laws of the United States, but to decide whether the Acts
							of Congress and of the several states are in conformity with the provisions of the
							Federal Constitution.</p>
						<p>This power of the courts to say whether laws are valid or in contravention of the
							Constitution and therefore invalid, is unique. The Constitution has been amended many
							times, and will be amended from time to time in accordance with the expressed wishes
							of the American people. While it is in force, all laws must conform to its provisions.
							Certain principles of Government, certain safeguards for the liberty and rights of our
							citizens, certain supports for the authority of Government itself, were placed in the
							Constitution. Those provisions are the very essence of Americanism. Whoever violates
							them is un-American and disloyal.</p>
						<p>It is to the creation and to the power of the Supreme Court of the United States,
							that we are indebted for the unity, the greatness and the power <pb id="VAC1119-038"
								n="38"/> of our Government. In the early part of the nineteenth century, selfish,
							narrow and local interests attempted to combat the supreme authority of our National
							Government. The various states attempted to set up powers of their own in conflict
							with the Constitution. Had they succeeded there would have been no nation, but a loose
							confederation of weak and quarreling states. The story of the struggle to solidify the
							national authority and to restrain the powers of the states to conformity with the
							Federal Constitution, is brilliantly told in Beveridge's <hi rend="i">Life of John
								Marshall</hi>. To Marshall, more than to any other man, we are indebted for the
							accomplishment of this great work. As Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
							States, he turned the numerous and divergent currents of American political life into
							one great national channel, and he must rank among the few immortals who have been the
							nationbuilders of the world.</p>
						<p>The work had two aspects. On the one hand, it required the courageous restraint of
							the several states, compelling them to limit themselves to their own sphere of
							political action. On the other hand, it involved the assertion and exercise of every
							power essential to the preservation of the National Government. It was Marshall's
							assertion and firm establishment of these national powers which enabled <pb
								id="VAC1119-039" n="39"/> Lincoln to preserve the Union. It was these same powers,
							which, in our war with Germany, enabled the National Government to raise an army of
							four million men by the power of draft; to take over and operate the railroads and
							shipping lines; to control the prices and distribution of food and other
							necessaries.</p>
						<p>In the days of Marshall, there were able and influential men who tried to destroy the
							authority and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. They attempted
							to deprive it of the right to declare laws unconstitutional. They sought to create the
							right of appeal from that court to Congress. Fortunately, all of these foolish efforts
							failed. Nothing remains of such unwisdom, except, that, now and then, some agitator,
							uninformed and unwise, lifts a solitary discordant voice and demands that our courts
							be restricted and deprived of their power to preserve the American principles of
							Government as laid down in our Constitution.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="cener sc">LOCAL GOVERNMENT</head>
						<p>The concluding principle of American institutions, to be mentioned here, is that
							local affairs are left to local Government, while affairs which are of general
							concern, are placed in the hands of a central authority. This principle begins at the
							very bottom <pb id="VAC1119-040" n="40"/> of our political structure and extends to
							the very top. Matters which are local to a town or township are governed by the people
							of the locality. Matters which concern an entire county and not merely a town,
							township or city are controlled by the county Government. Those concerns which are of
							still more general interest and have state-wide importance are placed in the hands of
							the governor, legislature, Supreme Court and other officers of the state. Finally,
							those things not local to any particular state, but which are of national concern, are
							assigned to the control of the National Government.</p>
						<p>The reason for such an arrangement is obvious. The central Government is less well
							informed than the people of a particular locality about those matters which are of
							strictly local importance. The central Government is left free from the encumbrance of
							details involved in local questions, and can therefore better devote itself to larger
							questions and more important decisions.</p>
						<p>It is evident that the two principles of local self-government and of a strong
							central Government, have merit and both are important to the liberties, the happiness
							and the well-being of the American people. However, the operation of each principle
							must be confined to the subjects which are properly its concern. The courts, and
							particularly <pb id="VAC1119-041" n="41"/> the Supreme Court of the United States,
							have been charged with the duty of drawing the dividing line between a just localism
							and a necessary nationalism. The two principles have come into conflict many times.
							They did so at the time of the Civil War, when Southern States claimed the right to
							maintain slavery as a local institution, while the Northern States declared that human
							freedom was a matter of supreme national concern, and this was paramount to the wishes
							of the southern people.</p>
						<p>Even within a state, questions of too much or too little centralization of power not
							infrequently arise. Ought trolley lines to be controlled by the city in which they
							operate, or by the state Government? Ought the valuation of real estate be made by
							local officers, or by a board of commissioners sitting at the state capital? Ought
							police to be controlled by state authorities, as a branch of the state Government, or
							by the city or town in which they perform their duties? Ought judges to be elected by
							the people of a locality where they hold court, or appointed by the governor of the
							state? These and similar questions are always with us, but good sense, self-restraint
							and sound judgment in the end find their way to a proper decision, even though
							mistakes may be made which require correction.</p>
						<p>In general, it may not be improper to say that <pb id="VAC1119-042" n="42"/> the
							Democratic party, from the days of Jefferson, has been more inclined to exalt the
							principle of localism, or of the right of local self-government. The Republican party,
							since the days of Lincoln, has been more inclined to defend and exalt the principle of
							nationalism. The very course of events, beyond the control of Government, has made for
							increasing centralization of Government power, both in states and nation. Thus,
							street-car lines, originally operating cars drawn by horses, were confined to cities
							and their immediate locality, and were naturally under local control. Now the electric
							trolley line has passed beyond local operation and serves to connect all the principal
							cities and towns of the state. This necessarily gives rise to some state control. So
							with railroads. Originally they were local affairs, but short local lines were
							gradually consolidated, so as to afford continuous transportation from state to state,
							until it became inevitable that the National Government should take over the control
							of railroads under the clause of the Federal Constitution which gives to Congress the
							power to control interstate commerce.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">AMERICANISM</head>
						<p>We have now briefly sketched the structure of American Government for the purpose,

							/>FOR AMERICAN VOTERS its parts, but of making plain the fact that it is pervaded from

							of every man and woman worthy the name of American. Nay, more, they require that

							not in the laws designed for their protection, but in the loyal spirit and devotion of
							our people. History shows only too plainly that the laws and governmental framework of
							a country may have all the appearances which characterize the institutions of a free
							and progressive people and yet in reality be only disguises for cruel, unjust,
							tyrannical Government. When, therefore, we talk about Americanism, let us understand
							that what is meant is not a mere glow of enthusiasm, a thrill when we sing <hi
								rend="i">The Star Spangled Banner</hi>, or see the flag carried by our troops. It is
							not even a fondness for the particular part of the world in which we live. Americanism
							means devotion to the institutions, and political principles embodied in them, which
							have been established in free America. If you would be American, worthy the name,
							stand for the laws of your country, its Government, its institutions.</p>

					<p>It is neither possible nor desirable for the institutions of Government in a

					<p>But the power of amendment, contained in the Federal Constitution, like provisions of
						the same sort in state Constitutions, has been carefully safeguarded. An amendment to

						Congress and submitted to the states. Of these, three&mdash;the one authorizing a
						Federal income tax, the one providing for the election of United States senators by the
						people, and the one prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
						liquors&mdash;have been adopted; and the fourth, granting suffrage to women, is now
						pending before the legislatures of the states, thirty-five of them having already
						ratified it.</p>
					<p>Every voter ought to understand the provision in the Constitution of his own state
						touching amendments, as these provisions differ in detail. In recent years there has
						arisen a movement which has for its single object making the process of amending
						Constitutions quicker and easier. This movement is only a part of a larger movement for
						the quicker, more direct and immediate control of the Government by the people. One of
						the earliest problems which confronts a new voter is, what position shall he take with
						respect to this movement, so called, for "more Democracy."</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DANGERS OF EASY AMENDMENT</head>
						<p>A good introduction to the study of this problem is to begin with the proposal to
							make the amending of Constitutions quicker and easier, The <pb id="VAC1119-046" n="46"
							/> root of the question is to be found in the reason for originally imposing checks on
							amendments. No right-minded person would deny the right of the people to alter their
							institutions, when it is certainly the settled wish of a substantial majority that
							they should be so changed. However, the founders of the republic, informed by history,
							with great political wisdom realized that with Democratic institutions, there is
							always the danger of precipitate and ill-considered action. No reader of American
							history can fail to be impressed by the tremendous waves of feeling, of sudden
							emotion, of political prejudice, of intense passion, by which the people are, from
							time to time, moved. Nor will the reader fail, just as frequently, to see how these
							storms subside, making no mark on the history of our country. Individuals are apt to
							get excited, and under the influence of intense feeling, make decisions which in a
							calmer mood they would never think of making, and which, unfortunately, they may
							bitterly regret. This is one of the inherent weaknesses of human nature, which to be
							sure does yield before the advance of civilization, of culture and of self-restraint.
							But it yields slowly. If this be the case with the private individual, it is far more
							true of humankind in the mass. Political decisions are often urged in excited
							assemblies and in crowded halls. Political principles <pb id="VAC1119-047" n="47"/>
							are advocated by gifted orators, and supported by vast processions of enthusiastic
							partisans. This is the way of Democracy, and it is not a bad way but it has its
							dangers. It is no easy thing to create and maintain a great and good Government, like
							that of the United States, when it is continually subjected to the danger of reckless,
							impulsive and dangerous decisions by the people themselves.</p>
						<p>Now the safeguards in the Constitution, making the process of amendment slow and
							deliberate, were designed to make sure that the people had given the subject under
							discussion their full and patient consideration; that they had been informed, as far
							as possible, of all the facts and all the arguments on both sides of the case. Having
							done all this, and having made up their minds, it is reasonable and necessary that the
							will of the majority should have its way. When the majority acts in this deliberate
							fashion, the result will usually be a good one. It is well that it should be so, for a
							majority of the voters, at any given time, are not acting merely for themselves. They
							are acting for posterity. Upon what they do, for good or for ill, depends the
							happiness or the misfortune of generations yet unborn. The fathers of the republic
							were plainly impressed with this solemn responsibility, for, in the very preamble to
							the Constitution, they declare their <pb id="VAC1119-048" n="48"/> purpose to "secure
							the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."</p>
						<p>If the arguments for these safeguards at the time our fathers adopted the Federal
							Constitution were sound, in the light of their knowledge of history, of human nature
							and of political theory, they seem even more conclusive now. Again and again we have
							been, and are being, exposed to the tempests of political passion. Again and again our
							Constitution has been an anchor which enabled the ship to outride the storm. Surely no
							reasonable voter can, in the light of our experience, be sure that our Government
							would be made better if constitutional amendments were made quicker and easier.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">COURTS AND CONSTITUTIONS</head>
						<p>Another revolutionary proposal, which has found some earnest advocates, is that the
							American system of Government be changed so as to deprive the courts, and in
							particular the Supreme Court of the United States, of the power to decide whether laws
							are valid and constitutional or not. Under the English system, Acts of Parliament can
							not be questioned by the courts, whereas, our system makes the court, and not the
							legislative body, the final judge on this question. The argument in favor of the
							change is that the legislature or Congress, which <pb id="VAC1119-049" n="49"/> enacts
							the laws, expresses the will of the voters now living, while the court may thwart that
							will by upholding the will of a former generation of voters as expressed in the
							Constitution but which is now dead and gone.</p>
						<p>A different form in which this proposal has been urged is, to permit an appeal from
							the court to a vote of the people, in cases where the court has held laws
							unconstitutional. The distinction between the two proposals is merely that in one case
							the vote of the legislature would be final, and in the other the vote of the
							people.</p>
						<p>Both proposals are open to the same objections. If either proposal were to prevail,
							it would mean the complete destruction of our American system of Government. Our
							written Constitutions would become scraps of paper, without value or validity. The
							limitations of power, which those Constitutions impose upon public officials and upon
							Government itself, would perish, leaving merely an uncontrolled despotism. True, this
							despotism would not be that of one tyrant, but would be exercised by a majority of the
							people. Yet, as we have seen, even majorities may be wrong. History is full of cases
							where a single human being, a minority of one, had moral right and justice on his
							side, while the multitude who destroyed him were in the wrong, and were <pb
								id="VAC1119-050" n="50"/> animated by cruel and unjust aims. No matter what the form
							of Government, the spirit of Government will always be the main thing. "By their
							fruits ye shall know them" is applicable to Governments as well as to men. A State
							which is so framed as to give power to injustice, to cruelty and to wrong is unworthy
							and ought to perish, even though the ruler may be, for the time being, perhaps for
							election day only, a majority of the people.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OUR CONSTITUTIONS OF SLOW GROWTH</head>
						<p>Our Constitutions were not written overnight. They embody, record and preserve the
							rights, the justice, the liberties, which have been achieved by the struggles and the
							sufferings of countless generations. Those rights have been developed and established,
							not by the vote at a single election but by the deliberate judgment of generation
							after generation of the best, the most enlightened and most progressive people known
							to history, the Anglo-Saxons. How foolish and dangerous it would be to risk the
							perpetuation of those sacred blessings of civilization, which our Constitutions are
							designed to preserve, to the whim, the prejudice, the passion, the interest, possibly
							the ignorance, of a majority of the people on a single day.</p>
						<p>If it be urged that the people must not be made <pb id="VAC1119-051" n="51"/> slaves
							to the dead hand of the past, and that the people of to-day have a right to control
							their own destiny, a complete answer is found in the provisions which authorize the
							amendment of our Constitutions. All that is required to effectuate the settled,
							deliberate and informed purpose of the people, is to take the proper, orderly and
							prudent course of thinking, debating and considering the matter so thoroughly that the
							possibility of serious mistake will be reduced to a minimum. There is no valid
							argument in favor of the revolutionary changes, above set forth, in the American
							system of Government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">RECALL&mdash;OBJECTIONS TO IT</head>
						<p>Another change in the American system, which has found support in some states, is the
							Recall. By this is meant the right of a certain number of voters, say ten per cent.,
							by a written petition, to require any office-holder to submit to a new election, to
							determine whether he ought to be recalled, or compelled to give up his office. The
							argument for this change is that office-holders sometimes fail or refuse to carry out
							the will of the people, or of the majority of the voters.</p>
						<p>The objections to this proposal far outweigh the arguments in its favor. An official
							guilty of misconduct, <pb id="VAC1119-052" n="52"/> or breach of duty, may be
							impeached, and removed from office by the courts, or in some in, stances by Congress,
							legislatures or city councils. If he be guilty of no misconduct, or violation of law,
							he ought not to be compelled to stand again and again in successive elections. Good
							men would be deterred from seeking or accepting office, if the fatigue, worry and
							expense of repeated elections must be undergone every little while, whenever a small
							body of enemies get enough signatures to a petition. The voters themselves will be
							harassed and excited by such constant electioneering. Public business will be
							neglected, and holders of office made cowards. The office-holder, instead of seeking
							to discharge his duty efficiently, will be hunting for popular favor, seeking to
							please the changing whim of the noisy and violent part of the community, whose attack
							he fears. The expense imposed upon the public treasury becomes a serious burden as a
							result of such frequent elections. Experience shows that petitions for Recall
							elections may contain forged signatures and that litigation is likely to result.
							Furthermore, as a rule the Recall election does not produce any different result from
							the original election, being merely an effort of the defeated side to have a new
							trial.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-053" n="53"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">RECALL OF JUDGES</head>
						<p>All of these objections and many more apply to the case of Recall of judges. A
							Government of law requires, more than anything else, brave, honest and able men for
							judges. The terrors of repeated Recall elections would tend to make cowards of our
							judges. A judge would be encouraged to decide cases, not according to the law but
							according to popular passion and favor. Government by law would perish, under such a
							system. Laws would have no vigor or binding force. The whim of the multitude, or of
							the noisy and violent part of the people, would be the real source of judicial
							decisions, instead of the law. It has been said that prosperity rests on credit,
							credit on confidence, and that confidence can only exist where just laws are wisely
							administered and fearlessly enforced so as to give security to contracts and certainty
							to individual rights. These results have long been secured by our present system. To
							make the proposed change would be like the dog dropping the bone to snatch at its
							shadow.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM</head>
						<p>Another innovation attempted in some parts of the country, is the enactment of laws
							by direct vote of the people. The Initiative is the name for this method, where a
							certain number or percentage of <pb id="VAC1119-054" n="54"/> voters may, by filing a
							written petition, require any proposed law which they may initiate, to be voted upon
							at an election. The Referendum is an appeal to the people, after the legislature has
							acted upon a bill, so that they may by their votes at an election have the final
							decision as to whether the measure shall become law.</p>
						<p>The argument for this new method of making laws is that legislatures often fail to
							enact laws which a majority of the people desire, or pass laws which the people do not
							desire. It is a plain departure from the American system, which is one of
							representative Government, in which the people act through their chosen
							representatives. The business of making laws is a very serious one, requiring special
							qualifications, extended study and trained judgment, and our system of legislative
							bodies, surrounded by constitutional checks, was intended to secure these things. At
							the same time, state Constitutions were always voted upon by the people before their
							adoption, and special questions, such as building a schoolhouse, a road, a bridge or a
							railroad, have often been submitted to direct vote.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OBJECTIONS BASED ON EXPERIENCE</head>
						<p>The objections to the Initiative and Referendum are based, not so much on political
							theory, as on actual experience. Voters are usually very busy in <pb id="VAC1119-055"
								n="55"/> the regular tasks of life. They have not the time to study, scarcely to
							read, long documents of many printed pages with technical details, which some one
							thinks should or should not become law. The long list of names of candidates at a
							general election is alone discouraging to the voter, and he often votes with little or
							no knowledge about the particular men. Much more is this the case where the voter
							finds several yards of printed matter, which constitute his ballot, on which he places
							"yes" or "no" to indicate whether these measures or any of them should become
							statutes. Furthermore, enormous expense in printing is caused by the Referendum.
							Elections become more and more costly, as well as burdensome. Sometimes serious delays
							and stoppage of public business occur, as where an appropriation bill, passed by the
							legislature, is referred to the people, who probably can not vote on it until the next
							election, while the money is needed at once. A state university was once embarrassed
							by lack of funds to pay its professors, by this proceeding. On the whole, while the
							people have the right to vote directly on their laws, the best results are obtained by
							leaving it to legislatures. The election of good men to these bodies is all that is
							necessary, and this can be secured by much less effort and expense than the Referendum
							involves.</p>
					</div3>

					<pb id="VAC1119-056" n="56"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PRIMARY ELECTIONS</head>
						<p>Primary elections, within a political party, for the choice of candidates which the
							party is to present at an approaching election, have long been known and resorted to,
							particularly in country communities. Until late years they were used only for
							selecting candidates for local offices. The convention was the favorite and
							established means for the selection of party candidates for national and state
							offices, and, though not quite so generally, for county offices. However, delegate
							conventions developed many abuses which became almost a scandal. It was urged by
							reformers that conventions often failed to express the will of the people; that the
							delegates were often influenced by unworthy motives; and that the people should
							introduce the more Democratic method of holding elections within the party, at which
							every member of the party would be entitled to express his choice. Accordingly this
							movement has gained great headway in the last few years in many states, although it
							has not yet become a nation-wide practise in the choice of candidates for president
							and vice-president.</p>
						<p>Experience has shown that the maxim relied on by advocates of primary elections that
							"the cure for the ills of Democracy is more Democracy" was quite <pb id="VAC1119-057"
								n="57"/> misleading and, in fact, when put in practise, often did more harm than
							good. Primary elections, it is found, tend to keep many good men, comprising often the
							very best material, from making the race for office. It is necessary, under this
							system, for a candidate to make two complete canvasses, one for the primary election
							and one for the general election. The expense, thus doubled, deters many; the physical
							fatigue and danger to health, deter many more. The result is that voters are apt to be
							deprived of the candidacy of the ablest available men, and their choice must be made
							from inferior material.</p>
						<p>Furthermore the primary does not even avoid the dangers and abuses of the convention,
							at least not in every case. Unless a candidate has a majority over all the votes cast
							at the primary, there must still be a convention to choose the candidate.</p>
						<p>Again, cunning politicians have found it easy, under the primary system, to
							consolidate the vote of their own organization upon some particular man, and to divide
							the vote of their opponents, by causing a number of almost equally good men to come
							into the race, thus dividing the vote of the better element in the party, and
							infallibly losing the election to the "slate" candidate.</p>
						<p>Whether this reform, so-called, is as good as the <pb id="VAC1119-058" n="58"/>
							regulation of conventions by careful laws, is a question about which good people
							differ, but it is certain that the primary election does not in actual operation yield
							results that are satisfactory.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ABOLITION OF THE SENATE</head>
						<p>One of the most recent proposals for change coming from a small labor group, is the
							abolition of the United States Senate. Such a thing hardly requires serious
							consideration. The plan of two Chambers was adopted by the authors of our Constitution
							in view of the success which had been achieved by the British Parliament, with its
							House of Lords, and House of Commons. Furthermore, the experience of the colonies,
							under the single-chambered Congress, compared unfavorably with the success of the
							British Parliament. It was found, as has been abundantly attested in many times and
							places, that a single body of representatives is more apt to make mistakes and enact
							foolish and ill-considered legislation, than a two-chambered body, where each measure
							is considered separately by the Upper and the Lower House, and its passage by both
							Houses made necessary, before it can become law. Such an arrangement does cause some
							delay, except where there is practical unanimity in both Houses, but it serves to keep
							the people informed <pb id="VAC1119-059" n="59"/> as to what is going on, and gives
							opportunity for public opinion to be formed and brought to bear upon the people's
							representatives.</p>
						<p>It has been claimed that the Senate of the United States, during nearly a century and
							a half, has been the greatest deliberative body known to history. Certainly it has had
							no 'superior. The talent, the aptitude for public affairs, the personal distinction
							and the gifts of debate possessed by its members, have given it a leading place under
							the American Constitution. Many of the greatest Americans have been members of the
							Senate, and their speeches are such models of patriotism and of oratory, that they are
							learned and recited by nearly every schoolboy. It is true that at times the Senate has
							seemed slow and even obstructive, but these defects are minor matters compared with
							the magnificent list of services which this body, throughout its existence, has as a
							rule rendered to the cause of Freedom and of popular Government.</p>
						<p>While the House of Representatives is chosen on the basis of population, the Senate
							is constituted peculiarly, with two members from each state, whether the state have a
							large or a small population. A stranger, unfamiliar with our institutions and history,
							might regard it as singular for Rhode Island to have as many votes in the Senate as
							the state of <pb id="VAC1119-060" n="60"/> New York. The explanation is that the
							colonies were originally independent commonwealths and when the Constitution was
							formed they asserted their political equality, as Sovereign States. The formation of
							the Senate is the outgrowth of this circumstance. As a matter of fact, the arrangement
							has proved a very fortunate one. Usually the Upper House has been hereditary in the
							monarchical states of Europe. Where the hereditary principle is rejected, as in
							America, it has been difficult in other countries to find a basis for the Upper House,
							which is not merely or nearly a duplication of the Lower House. If the two bodies are
							exactly like each other, there seems little advantage in having two chambers. America,
							alone, has had the admirable arrangement of equal representation of unequal states,
							and it has worked well. One reason is that small states and large states are found
							scattered throughout the entire continent, east and west, north and south. Of course
							any large state might with reason have its territory divided into several states, by
							Act of Congress, thus increasing its membership in the Senate, but such a wish is
							entirely absent, alike in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Texas. Of course
							the small states like those of New England, and the West and South, have no cause for
							complaint. It is not likely that any change <pb id="VAC1119-061" n="61"/> will be made
							in the near future in the composition of the Senate. Its rules may be modernized to
							facilitate business, but it is safe to say that no considerable number of intelligent
							American voters will soon desire its abolition.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GROUP GOVERNMENT</head>
						<p>The most amazing, the most recent and the most revolutionary demand for alteration of
							the American system, is the demand that representation of the people by geographical
							districts be abolished, and representation of occupational groups replace it. This
							idea comes to us direct from Russia, where it has been embodied in the Russian Soviet
							Government, of Lenine and Trotzky. John Spargo, the Socialist, advocates it in <hi
								rend="i">The Psychology of Bolshezism</hi>, page 59 <hi rend="i">et seq.</hi><ref
								id="ref_001" rend="super" target="note_001">*</ref> He declares that the political
							state is unfitted for the technical work of industrial organization and management.
							Instead of our Government representatives being chosen from defined geographical
							units, they should be chosen, he thinks, upon the basis of occupational groups. Each
							industrial group would choose representatives from its own number. This would exclude
							the parasitically idle. What is now termed "Soviet Government" was outlined by DeLeon,
							in a speech at Minneapolis, in 1905. He said: <note id="note_001"><ref
									target="ref_001" rend="super">*</ref>See also <hi rend="i">Bolshevism and the
									United States</hi>, by C. E. Russell, p. 303.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-062" n="62"/>
							<q rend="blockquote">"The mining, the railroad, the textile industries, down or up the
								line, each of these, regardless of former political boundaries, will be the
								constituencies of the new central authority. Like the flimsy card house that
								children raise, the present political Governments of countries, of states, aye, of
								the City on the Potomac herself, will tumble down, their places taken by the central
								and subordinate administrative organs of the Nation's industrial forces."</q></p>
						<p>After making this quotation, Spargo says: "There will be no other Government than
							this. What is here described is Soviet Government pure and simple, for Soviet
							Government is simply the Russian term for Government by councils of labor unions."</p>
						<p>If we assume a House of Representatives of five hundred members chosen by and from
							the various occupational groups, as they existed in the United States according to the
							census of 1910o, it would be composed approximately as follows: <table rows="7"
								cols="2">

							</table></p>
						<p>Spargo complains that more than half of the House of Representatives in 919 were
							lawyers, <pb id="VAC1119-063" n="63"/> and that this is not representative. As a
							matter of fact lawyers are chosen so frequently because, as special students who have
							devoted their lives to the study of history, political constitutions and
							jurisprudence, they are experts in law. Their minds are trained to ascertain the old
							law and its evils, and to draft new laws remedying those evils. The making of laws,
							certainly, is as much a matter of expert knowledge as the making of a locomotive or an
							automobile, in which lawyers would indeed be but bunglers.</p>
						<p>No one can carefully examine the above table and feel the slightest assurance that
							such a Congress would produce better laws, for the welfare of the whole people, than
							we have had under our American system which leaves voters of every occupation free to
							choose those who, in their opinion, would best represent them in Congress. At any rate
							we ought to be well content to let Russia try out the experiment, while we observe its
							results, before the great American Republic embarks on such a doubtful venture. Under
							the Russian system, voters would be limited in the choice of representatives to their
							own group, miners choosing a miner, iron-workers an iron-worker, and so on. A voter
							might know a hundred persons, outside his own particular group, better qualified to
							enact laws than any man in his <pb id="VAC1119-064" n="64"/> group, yet he would be
							compelled to choose the inferior man.</p>
						<p>What is more important is that, under our present system, the voters of a particular
							locality have not only a free choice from the whole population, but the person thus
							chosen acts as the sworn representative of the interests of the whole people. A
							congressman elected by all the voters of his district represents all groups and all
							districts, quite as much as his own.</p>
						<p>Under the occupational or group system, each representative, being chosen by his own
							class alone and under obligations to no members of any other group, class or
							occupation, would inevitably regard himself as the representative of his own group
							exclusively. That prime object of our Constitution which is defined in the preamble as
							being "to promote the general welfare" would go down under a welter of class conflicts
							growing out of the excessive encouragement of classes and of group consciousness.
							Patriotism, in the sense of loyal service to the entire American people, would
							perish.</p>
						<p>In one instance, class consciousness has brought danger to our beloved country, and
							that was when the people of the Southern States became class-conscious through their
							adherence to slavery and pressed their own interest, as distinct from the general <pb
								id="VAC1119-065" n="65"/> interest of the whole people, until the issue was settled
							in the tears and the blood of the Civil War.</p>
						<p>If we would preserve our country and hand down to posterity the rich heritage which
							we have received from our fathers, we must fight class feeling. We must encourage
							national patriotism, and learn to consider the public interest as supreme over all
							private interests, whether that interest asserts itself in the form of trade unions,
							occupational groups, trusts, capitalist syndicates or in any other form.</p>
						<p>Socialists are for the most part un-American, either in birth like Spargo, or in
							feeling if, like him, they think the Russian Soviet form of Government superior to the
							Constitution of the United States. Let no lover of his country tolerate the notion of
							a Government composed of representatives of groups or classes, instead of
							representatives of the whole people. Should such a revolutionary change as that we are
							now considering ever come to pass, we can best form an idea of what our country will
							become by looking at what Russia is, under the Soviet system. Let us have a Government
							which represents the people, the whole people, and nothing but the people.</p>

					<p>The primary purpose of our free public schools is to train American youth in the duties
						of citizenship; and of these, the first and the most universal is the obligation to vote
						wisely. That this is the first object of the State, in maintaining free schools for all
						children, is shown by the fact that America derived two principles from the French
						Revolution which were interdependent. The first was the free and equal right of all men
						to vote, and the second, the duty of the State to provide schools for all youths, since
						if the people were to rule they must be fitted for the task. Schools had previously been
						controlled by the church, and furnished education almost exclusively to the children of
						the nobility and to candidates for the priesthood. With the advent of the modern
						Democratic State, the State school became a necessity, as a matter of self-preservation
						for the Government.</p>
					<p>The important relation of our free public schools to Government, as a place of training
						for the proper exercise of the right to vote, has been obscured by several causes. Girls
						have generally been taught in <pb id="VAC1119-067" n="67"/> the same schools with boys,
						and until recently women 'did not have the right to vote. Furthermore, most teachers
						were women, who, being deprived of any part in actual politics, took little or no
						interest in subjects vitally important for the training of voters. It has generally been
						supposed that the only object of such schools was to train children for getting on in
						the world, to develop their individual powers, stimulate ambition and train them in
						habits of study, industry and punctuality. All of these things are among the true aims
						of our public-school system, but they are subordinate to the imperative necessity of
						educating voters in the sound principles of Government, and in a sense of duty toward
						the State.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL ELECTIONS</head>
						<p>School elections are usually separate affairs from other elections, and they ought to

						<p>Even more important is the fact that at school <pb id="VAC1119-068" n="68"/>
							elections, the policy of the schools, the kind of instruction which they are to give,
							is determined. If school authorities are chosen who are not "one hundred per cent.
							American," the pupils are likely to be instructed by teachers who are not wholly and
							loyally American. It is of the highest importance that no teacher be given charge of
							pupils in an American school who is not an absolute patriot, loyal not only to the
							American flag but to the American system of Government; a lover not only of his
							country as an agreeable place in which to live but as a place where the greatest
							success in Government known to history has been achieved. To continue and increase
							that success must be the teacher's first aim, in the daily performance of school-room
							duties.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">TEACHING PATRIOTISM</head>
						<p>It has been declared by a great authority, that in the first few years of childhood
							more is learned than in the entire remainder of life, Certain it is, that patriotism
							must be taught in childhood and youth, For that, first of all, are our schools
							established and maintained.</p>
						<p>The teaching of patriotism is more important to the future of our country than the
							teaching of grammar and arithmetic. If first voters come to the polls lacking
							patriotism, loyalty and judgment, it is <pb id="VAC1119-069" n="69"/> the fault of the
							schools which have failed to perform their highest duty.</p>
						<p>Too often. it is supposed that the unfurling of the schoolhouse flag, and the singing
							of two or three patriotic hymns, are all that can be done to awaken the love of
							country in the heart of childhood, Unhappily, a slight emotion such as these things
							produce, is neither permanent nor important. In fact it may do harm. An examination of
							the principal patriotic American songs discloses the fact that they give only a
							one-sided view of America. Nearly all of them are devoted exclusively to the idea of
							freedom. <hi rend="i">The Star Spangled Banner</hi> is to wave over "the land of the
							free, and the home of the brave." <hi rend="i">America</hi>, our next most beautiful
							hymn, written in 1832 by a Baptist clergyman, of Boston, is almost wholly devoted to
							praise of "freedom." Every stanza mentions it. God is referred to as "author of
							liberty."</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OVER-EMPHASIS OF LIBERTY</head>
						<p>It is evident that praise of freedom and of liberty, glorious as they are, can be
							pushed too far, particularly when teaching children. God is not only the author of
							liberty, but the author of law. From the time when the Ten Commandments were
							instituted, God has been known to every Christian <pb id="VAC1119-070" n="70"/> people
							as the Lawgiver. It is just as important that children should have law and obedience
							emphasized, as a part of all true Americanism, as it is to emphasize liberty. Children
							get an imperfect idea of their country and of their duty toward that country, if they
							sing only about freedom and not about obedience to authority. The mischief is not
							confined to our American-born children. Immigrants come to our shores in vast numbers,
							quite ignorant of America, of popular Government and of our institutions. One of the
							first things which they learn is to sing these patriotic songs. Their heads are filled
							with the single idea of uncontrolled liberty, and absolute personal freedom. They
							think that when they come to America they have the right to do just what they please.
							Their hearts are often filled with hatred of unjust Government under which they have
							lived, to escape which they have come to this country, "the land of the free." The
							result often is that they resent our laws, our courts, our public authorities. They
							think, somehow, that our Government, having been founded upon the basis of the
							Declaration of Independence, has been perverted by tyrants, when it is proposed to
							subject them to our reasonable laws. A mischief is wrought in their uninstructed
							minds. Many of them remain here as advocates, not of ordered freedom as we <pb
								id="VAC1119-071" n="71"/> know it, but of license, and of anarchy, which know no
							God, no law, no Government.</p>
						<p>The over-emphasis of freedom, and the failure to impress the minds of the young and
							of immigrants with the corresponding ideas of law and of obedience, were also partly
							the result of our Civil War. The great achievement of that terrible war and its
							unmeasured sacrifices, was the abolition of negro slavery. Not only did the negro, but
							his white brother, naturally come to think of freedom as the one great glorious
							characteristic of America. <hi rend="i">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</hi> has the
							beautiful line: <q rend="blockquote">"As He died to make men holy, let us die to make
								men free."</q></p>
						<p>Here again we find emphasis laid almost exclusively upon freedom as the great
							controlling characteristic of the American Government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">LIBERTY HAS LIMITATIONS</head>
						<p>It is true that in many ways we have more liberty than has been possessed by any
							other civilized people in the history of the world. Our people are free to control the
							making of their own laws. They are free to require those laws to be equally and
							impartially enforced against rich and poor, white and black, against every class and
							every interest. <pb id="VAC1119-072" n="72"/> They possess the unqualified right to
							freedom of opinion. Within wide limits, they possess the right to freedom of speech,
							but this right does not include freedom to advocate the overthrow of Government, or
							resistance to its laws. Our people have the right to their own religion and to worship
							God according to the dictates of individual conscience. But this religious liberty
							does not include the right to do things which are prohibited by law, even in the name
							and under the guise of the worship of Almighty God. Mormons claim polygamy to be a
							divine institution, and they may hold this opinion if they like, but if a Mormon
							attempts to carry his belief into practise, by having more than one wife, he is guilty
							of crime and is subject to punishment.</p>
						<p>A fundamental principle of Americanism is, that we must so use our liberty, and so
							exercise our rights, as not to invade the liberty, or rights, of other persons.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PATRIOTISM IN THE SCHOOLS</head>
						<p>Our schools should not fail to correct the error which has permitted the young, the
							inexperienced and the ignorant to get their minds filled with the false and
							anarchistic notions of unrestrained personal freedom. They should be taught the
							doctrines of qualified liberty. The teacher must also make it a daily concern to
							awaken and strengthen a true love <pb id="VAC1119-073" n="73"/> of country, a sound
							patriotism. This does not mean merely an awakening of the spirit of the soldier, by
							dwelling on the glories of war, the victories of our armies, the achievements of men
							who have followed our flag and have died gloriously in its defense. All this is
							necessary, but it is the easiest part of patriotism for the teacher to inculcate. What
							is far more important is to teach the patriotism of peace. The child should be taught
							to see all the advantages, the comfort, the protection, which our Government affords
							to the people of America. Love of country must be taught, so as to develop in our
							young people willingness to sacrifice personal interest for the common good,
							particularly when the time comes to vote. Our youth should be taught that, only by
							sacrifice of self-interest, of class interest, of group interest, for the common good,
							can our republic be preserved. Our ideal must be perfect justice to every man, woman
							and child. Much remains to be accomplished. Constant reform, constant study, constant
							effort on the part of every citizen, to improve and make our social justice more
							nearly perfect, are required, and always will be required.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">HISTORY'S LESSONS IN PATRIOTISM</head>
						<p>The love of country, such as we have been urging, the patriotism of peace, can not be
							instilled <pb id="VAC1119-074" n="74"/> into the mind of youth in any better way than
							by unceasing study of history. It is thus that we can come to realize the achievements
							of the American republic. By reading and learning of the sufferings and sacrifices,
							the unselfishness and the courage of those patriots who have gone before, and, as
							Lincoln said, "have paid the last full measure of devotion," our youth may come to
							know what America means to humanity. The study of history is the school of the
							patriot.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SCHOOLS SHOULD HELP PRESERVE GOVERNMENT</head>
						<p>Our Government has the right and is charged with the duty of self-preservation. The
							school children of to-day will rule the State of to-morrow. What they are taught, and
							what they are not taught, will largely determine the character of their votes and
							their opinions when they reach maturity. The foundation principles on which our
							Government and our institutions rest must be clearly explained and advocated by
							teachers in every state school and college.</p>
						<p>Our Government rests upon religion, law, the family and private property. No person
							who is a disbeliever in the institutions on which existing civilization is based
							should be permitted to teach in any institution supported out of funds raised by <pb
								id="VAC1119-075" n="75"/> taxation. One may rightfully claim the privilege of
							believing that our fundamental institutions are wrong, but such a person has no right
							to teach in our schools. The schools are intended to help preserve the existing State
							and the existing social order, and not to destroy them. Atheists, anarchists,
							free-lovers and Socialists, therefore, should be excluded from the ranks of
							public-school teachers and professors in state universities.</p>
						<p>It is a great mistake to suppose that religion, law, the family and private property
							are matters of indifference in school instruction; that it is the duty of the teacher
							to ignore them, as controversial, or to encourage uncertainty and indecision in the
							minds of pupils, treating these as open questions. They are not open questions, so far
							as public schools are concerned. They are essential subjects upon which instruction
							ought to be given.</p>
						<p>Under our Government, Church and State are separate. Instruction in any form of
							religious faith can not be permitted in our schools. But it is proper and necessary
							that children should be taught respect and reverence for every form of the Christian
							religion, including also the religion of the Jews. The child should be told of the
							mysteries of the universe, of stars and rocks, of flowers and sunbeams, of .man's
							relation to nature, to the past, to the future, <pb id="VAC1119-076" n="76"/> and to
							his fellow man. No intelligent mind can fail to find in these things the basis of true
							religious feeling and conviction.</p>
						<p>Those parts of the Bible which have no relation to the disputes between different
							forms of religious belief, may be read and taught in our schools, and should by no
							means be neglected. The Ten Commandments, the Psalms, the Book of Proverbs, the great
							prophecies which touch the course of ancient civilization, the sayings of Jesus,
							should be persistently presented to youthful minds, as a basis for wise and patriotic
							citizenship.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SACREDNESS OF THE FAMILY</head>
						<p>The sacredness of the family should be taught in school. All proposals to weaken the
							tie between husband and wife, between parents and children, should be treated as
							highly dangerous, and opposed to the interests and happiness of future generations. No
							one thing has done more to lift humanity above the life of animals than the home, as
							we have it, where children spend many years in the process of being trained and
							developed. Animals have no such family life and no such training. The moment any
							creature, other than a human being, is able to find food for itself, and this takes
							place in a very short time after birth, its training in the family is <pb
								id="VAC1119-077" n="77"/> at an end. Children, fortunately, linger many years
							through the period of education in the family circle, and are fitted by such training
							for a life which is far removed from mere animal existence. Every movement which has
							for its object the breakdown of the family, as we have it, tends to break down our
							civilization. Many Socialists have advocated free love, the voluntary change of
							marriage relations at any time. This involves the break-up of the home, and the
							neglect of children. To meet this, Socialists have advocated the rearing of children
							by the State, in public barracks or asylums. No one who values Americanism can
							contemplate the substitution of the asylum for the home as a place for the rearing of
							children, without a feeling of horror. Surely the time to impress the importance of
							the family upon the mind is in childhood, and the public school is one place where
							such instruction can not be omitted, without a failure of duty.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">RIGHT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY</head>
						<p>So, also, our civilization rests upon private property, the right to own and keep
							what one has earned and saved. It is true that one may rightfully claim the privilege
							of advocating Socialism, and the abolition of private property, in whole or in part.
							An American citizen may publicly argue that all <pb id="VAC1119-078" n="78"/> property
							should belong to the State, and all persons become employees of the State. But such
							ideas are 'destructive of our present civilization, which our schools are designed to
							preserve. Socialism should therefore be attacked and exposed, in our high schools and
							colleges, as an agent of destruction. If the Government has not the right to train
							children to disbelieve in Socialism, and to believe in the righteousness and utility
							of private property as an institution beneficial and necessary to the whole community,
							then our Government does not possess the right or the power of self-preservation.</p>
						<p>When school elections, therefore, are held, it becomes the duty of every voter to
							consider carefully the opinions of candidates on these vital questions, and to vote
							wisely and conscientiously, with these matters, touching the character of school
							instruction, carefully kept in view.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PUBLIC LIBRARIES</head>
						<p>It often happens that school authorities are entrusted with the management of
							circulating libraries, as a part of our general system of free education. Where this
							is the case, school elections raise the issue of what books should be placed in such
							libraries, for general circulation and reading. Such libraries are agencies of the
							State, and are maintained <pb id="VAC1119-079" n="79"/> for the benefit of the general
							public. If one were to propose that there should be put in such a public library books
							which teach the art of making counterfeit money, the crime of safe-blowing, the way to
							commit murder by secret poison, without discovery of the murderer, every sane person
							would 'denounce it as an outrage. If it be wrong for the State to teach the art of
							burglary, as applied to a bank, a shop or a dwelling, is it not far worse to circulate
							a book which teaches the art of robbing a whole country? If to steal a little is a
							crime, to steal much can not be right. Therefore, books advocating Socialism,
							Syndicalism, Bolshevism, anarchy, free love or any other revolutionary change of the
							existing State and social order, should he excluded from circulating libraries. If
							such books are deemed to be of scientific value, they should be kept strictly for use
							by scientific students, obtaining a special license from the librarian after he is
							satisfied the applicant is not likely to be harmed himself, or do harm to others.</p>
						<p>That this caution is not a foolish one, is supported by the interview on December 18,
							1919, in New York, with Thomas Buhkanob, the seventeen-year-old anarchist, who was, a
							few days later, after five years' residence in America, deported to Russia. This boy
							declared that he had no trouble in obtaining <pb id="VAC1119-080" n="80"/> the radical
							books he desired, printed in Russian, from the New York Public Library, although the
							director said he was unable to find them listed in the catalogue. Buhkanob also said
							that some rich men "have unwittingly aided the spread of revolutionary doctrines," by
							supplying free libraries in many places, which carried on their shelves and supplied
							to the public books advocating every form of revolution!</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">VOCATIONAL TRAINING</head>
						<p>The latest development of educational theory requires public schools in cities of
							sufficient size to include courses of training in various trades and occupations. In
							this way the pupil learns, at an early age, the technical and scientific methods in
							industry, as well as acquires mere manual skill. The doctrine of equal opportunity for
							every child means that the child should have a fair chance to develop his best
							abilities to their highest point. The complaint is sometimes made that managerial
							talent, in big business, is greatly overpaid, in comparison with the pay of workmen.
							The reason is that managing talent is one of the scarcest things in the market. It may
							well be that a boy who receives technical training in youth, may discover in himself
							an aptitude for the management of industry, He may, <pb id="VAC1119-081" n="81"/>
							therefore, be expected to reach a much higher stage and to become much more useful as
							a member of society if he realizes his highest capabilities. When technical education
							shall have made managerial talent more abundant, its great salaries will decline.</p>
						<p>The social value of manual and technical training, in preventing the growth of class
							feeling, and in encouraging democratic sympathies between hand and brain workers, must
							certainly be of great benefit to the nation. Rousseau, who promulgated the doctrine of
							the equal right of all men to the ballot, and advocated popular education, also urged
							the advisability of every youth learning a manual trade. This, he thought, would prove
							valuable in maintaining sympathy and mutual respect between all parts of society.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">MILITARY TRAINING</head>
						<p>The World War found America without any system for the training of young men in the
							performance of their military duties, as defenders of their country. This question, in
							its relation to the subject of the general defense of the nation, is discussed
							elsewhere. Here it is pointed out that such training would have very high educational
							value. A boy should be taught that it is his duty to defend his country by going to
							war, if such a sad necessity <pb id="VAC1119-082" n="82"/> should arise. Instruction
							in youth in the performance of such a duty, through military training, would probably
							be an effective method for teaching patriotism. Furthermore, other much needed things
							in American life, such as respect for and obedience to law and authority, and a sense
							of the value of discipline, can be secured by a reasonable period in the training
							camp.</p>
						<p>It is proper to say that the opposite view on this question is held by many excellent
							persons. It has been well expressed by a prominent clergyman, who recently said in
							substance that universal military training would create a love of war in the hearts of
							our young men. He thought that men who were trained to fight, would want to fight, and
							would become an effective influence in American politics, favorable to war. The answer
							to this view, if there be one, is that evidence is lacking to show that universal
							military training, for a brief period for American youths, would produce a military
							aspiration for aggressive war. Our people have never shown the slightest tendency of
							this sort. It is hard to believe that they could be induced to love war, for its own
							sake, by any kind of training.</p>

						<p>This chapter can not be concluded in a better way than by mentioning the policy of

					<p>In as much as it is necessary to have Government, and Government is expensive, it
						follows that the necessary funds must be raised by taxation. Government expenditures are
						usually made with extravagance. A really frugal and thrifty administration of a public
						office or undertaking does sometimes occur, but with discouraging infrequency. Even
						worse than extravagance, is the constant recurrence of official corruption. It is
						therefore inevitable that every election tenders an issue of honest and economical use
						of public funds, as against their dishonest or extravagant use. From the election of
						president, senator or congressman of the United States, down through state, county,
						city, school and township elections, the financial issue is always present, and it is
						the prime duty of every voter to give it careful consideration.</p>
					<p>It would seem natural for the public always to be on the side of economy and against
						extravagance. This is not so. On the contrary the public usually neglects this issue.
						Extravagance, disguised under various form of liberal expense, often is more <pb
							id="VAC1119-085" n="85"/> popular than frugality., A city councilman of long
						experience and little principle, once told the writer that the majority of voters
						usually favored city officials who advocated large expenditures and liberal contracts
						for improvements. Let us first see why this is so, and then show why it is to every
						one's interest to favor economy.</p>
					<p>Voters who favor public extravagance may be persons who are not thrifty and prudent in
						their own private affairs. It is only a minority, sometimes a rather small one, who
						exercise good judgment and prudent self-restraint in spending money. We should not
						wonder that such persons are therefore often in the minority on an issue of public
						economy as against public extravagance.</p>
					<p>Again, public moneys are raised by taxation, and more often than not, a majority of the
						voters pay no taxes and do not concern themselves about public expenses, to which they
						think, erroneously, that they ~Io not have to contribute. There are also many persons,
						such as contractors, laborers and those who hold or desire offices or appointments in
						the public service, who personally benefit from liberal disbursements. These are often
						reenforced by persons of generous imagination but unsound judgment, who join in a
						popular outcry for unnecessary, unwise or untimely public expenses, for such desirable
						objects <pb id="VAC1119-086" n="86"/> as new parks and schoolhouses, handsome
						boulevards, magnificent new public buildings, courthouses, coliseums and the like. One
						of the strongest arguments against giving votes to women, in a certain city, was that
						while less than one-third of the male voters paid taxes, the number of women voters who
						would pay taxes would be less than five per cent. of the total number of women
						voters.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WHO PAYS THE TAXES?</head>
						<p>The wide-spread belief of our people that taxes are only paid by the persons whose
							names are on the list as taxpayers, and that the rest of the people pay no taxes, is
							an error which has far-reaching consequences. To correct this mistaken opinion, it is
							necessary only to consider a few of the different kinds of taxes which we have in this
							country. The general property tax is the one upon which states, counties and cities
							chiefly depend for their revenues. The usual form of this tax is a percentage, fixed
							each year, of the assessed value of all property, land, houses, bonds, mortgages,
							machinery, farm products and the like. Each property-holder pays in proportion to what
							he owns, and pays just the same percentage as do his neighbors. But this statement is
							only a half truth. In fact, while the property-holder is the person who is called the
							taxpayer, because <pb id="VAC1119-087" n="87"/> lie goes through the form of giving a
							check or cash to the county treasurer for the amount of the taxes standing against him
							in any current year, he is not, in most cases, the person who really pays.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE CONSUMER PAYS</head>
						<p>If a business room be occupied by a shoe merchant, who rents it from the owner, it is
							plain that the owner gets the money with which he pays the tax on the property from
							the shoe merchant. The merchant, in turn, although the tax is included in his rent,
							does not pay the rent out of his own means, but usually gets the money from his
							customers who buy his shoes; for the tax on the property is added to and concealed in
							the price of the shoes. The tax, therefore, while apparently paid by the
							property-holder, is really paid by the person who buys and wears the shoes. In other
							words, as the popular expression is, "the consumer pays." This illustration applies to
							every article that is used, whether it be clothing or hats, food or fuel, newspapers
							or Victrolas, automobiles or seats at the theater. Now in respect to what individuals
							can consume, there is much less difference than one would suppose. The poor laborer
							and the rich capitalist eat about the same amount of food, and wear about the same
							amount of clothing. At least, the difference between their <pb id="VAC1119-088" n="88"
							/> food and clothes is very slight, when compared with the difference in the value of
							their possessions. So we see that a very large part of the sums raised by taxation and
							expended by Government are actually paid by the whole community, whether so-called
							taxpayers or not, and the whole people pay these taxes in very nearly equal amounts,
							the poor man not such a very different amount from the rich man, but the man with a
							large family of children much more than the man with a small family. As a rule, poor
							men whose names are not on the books of the tax collector are utterly indifferent
							about taxation and public expense. If they understood the very simple truth that,
							broadly speaking, it is true that the consumer pays the taxes, rather than the
							taxpayer so-called, the poor man would see that he is much more concerned in public
							expenses than those who are better off, since the burden is much heavier for him than
							for his wealthier neighbors. It is not claimed that all property taxes are transferred
							to the consumer. The tax on a vacant lot, on an empty store room, or on a piece of
							property which is unprofitable as an investment, can not as a rule be transferred.</p>
						<p>The rule, however, that the consumer pays, applies to residence property, flats,
							lodgings and the like, quite as much as to business property. The owner who occupies
							his own house is also the consumer, <pb id="VAC1119-089" n="89"/> that is, the one who
							uses and enjoys the property; but, if he rent his property to some one else, the
							tenant is really the person who pays the tax which is concealed in the rent.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FURTHER BURDENS OF THE CONSUMER</head>
						<p>Income taxes and taxes on business profits are generally supposed to be incapable of
							being transferred by the taxpayer to the consumer. As a matter of fact, a
							manufacturer, a merchant or a banker, includes the tax on the income or profit of his
							business as an operating expense, which, like the wages of his employees, is to be
							paid for by his customers, the tax being a part of the price charged. If, however, a
							merchant can not sell his goods at prices which pay his operating expenses, including
							taxes, he must quit business. His particular establishment will disappear, as an
							unprofitable undertaking, while those industries which survive are merely those which
							are able to sell goods profitably, that is, at prices to which taxes as well as all
							other expenses and interest on capital, have been added.</p>
						<p>The Federal Government, under our Constitution, can not levy a direct property tax.
							For over a century, it derived its income from tariffs and internal revenue taxes,
							so-called. It is quite plain that a tariff paid upon goods imported from foreign
							countries, <pb id="VAC1119-090" n="90"/> must, in order to make the transaction
							profitable, form a part of the price of the goods in this country. Likewise an
							internal revenue tax, such as the tax on tobacco, is very plainly a part of the price
							of the cigar or cigarette, and is ultimately paid by the consumer.</p>
						<p>These considerations show that every person who casts a vote must contribute to the
							public treasury and ought to concern himself at every election with the question of
							public expenses and of taxation. It is probable that the high cost of living,
							following America's entrance into the World War, will long remain a typical
							illustration of the extreme effect of taxes upon prices. While high war taxes were by
							no means the only cause, they added to the burden of daily expenses which every family
							felt.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">TAXATION AND FARM PRODUCTION</head>
						<p>High taxes reduce the profit of farming and tend to restrict the production on
							American farms. If the farm is not profitable, it can not be cultivated. In order to
							have an abundance of farm products, at fair prices, we need to have maximum
							production. This means that not merely the best farms must be worked to capacity, but
							medium farms, and even poor farms, must furnish all that they can produce. The
							inevitable effect of unnecessary taxes is to reduce <pb id="VAC1119-091" n="91"/> the
							quantity of farm products. The best farms may be able to stand the burden, but many of
							the poorer sort will be abandoned, or imperfectly cultivated. This reduction of
							products is bound to cause an increase in price, which finally reaches the consumer.

						<head rend="section sc">TARIFF</head>
						<p>No question has affected political controversy throughout the history of civilized
							States more than that of taxation. It was this question which lay at the beginning of
							both the American and the French <pb id="VAC1119-092" n="92"/> Revolutions. It has
							been the question of tariff which, more than any other, has been the chief issue at
							elections since the Civil War. It is not unlikely that taxation will be the subject
							over which the fiercest contentions will arise during the remainder of the present
							political epoch in America.</p>
						<p>The dispute over the relative merits of tariff on imports and free trade, or as it
							has been more generally described, between a protective tariff and a revenue tariff,
							has raged, with more or less violence, from Colonial times to the present day.
							Students of politics have more than once declared that this issue was one of the best
							for American political parties to divide upon. At some times, and under some
							circumstances, the advantages of a lower tariff seem reasonably certain to a majority
							of the voters. At other times and under other circumstances, the reverse is true. A
							very brief statement of the two arguments is all that is necessary, since every
							political campaign, in which the tariff issue becomes paramount, furnishes the fullest
							information to every voter.</p>
						<p>Both revenue tariffs and protective tariffs are designed to and do raise large
							revenue for the Government. Both kinds of tariff laws do, to some extent, raise prices
							in America, and therefore both give more or less protection to American industry. No
								<pb id="VAC1119-093" n="93"/> purely revenue tariff has been in force in this
							country since the Civil War, nor has any purely protective tariff been in force during
							that time. Yet there are substantial differences in the tariff, according to the
							political party and policy which for the time being prevails. Tariffs are lower and
							are distributed differently, under so-called revenue tariff laws, from those imposed
							on imports, under the so-called protective policy.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">REVENUE TARIFF</head>
						<p>The revenue tariff, with consequent low prices, appeals to the man who is chiefly
							interested as a buyer in getting low prices. A college professor is often a typical
							instance of a man who. inclines to revenue tariff, because he wants his professional
							income to go as far as possible. Great numbers of people are often influenced by the
							same considerations. The South, with cotton as its chief product, largely sold in
							foreign markets, has always inclined to the revenue tariff, because protective duties
							do not raise the price of cotton, while such duties do raise the price of many
							articles which the planter daily consumes, and therefore desires to purchase as
							cheaply as possible. With the development of American cane-sugar business, Southern
							States, where that industry existed, showed an inclination <pb id="VAC1119-094" n="94"
							/> to insist on protective tariff on sugar. Beet-sugar industry had a similar effect
							in the North.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PROTECTIVE TARIFF</head>
						<p>Protective tariffs appeal to those who are chiefly interested in manufacturing
							articles with which foreign products compete. The price of labor in Europe and Asia
							has always been much lower than in America, where our vast undeveloped natural
							resources create such demand for labor, and where from many causes, living cost and
							the standards of living are much higher than abroad. Hence the foreign manufacturer,
							availing himself of cheap labor, can often sell cheaper in the American market than
							American producers, unless the difference in labor cost is equalized by protective
							tariff.</p>
						<p>Protectionists point to the great development of manufacturing in the United States
							since the Civil War, to the growth of cities, the development of natural resources,
							the demand for labor, skilled and unskilled, the constantly rising wages of working
							men, improvements in the general standards of living, and the growth of the country's
							wealth, as evidences of the benefits of protection. Revenue tariff men 'declare that
							protection raises the price, not only of imported goods, but of the competing domestic
							product, which is true. They say that excessive tariffs have over-developed cities:
							and <pb id="VAC1119-095" n="95"/> have tended to the creation of large fortunes, and
							to an excessive concentration of wealth by the captains of industry. They say that the
							old theory, that when the industry was firmly established protection would be
							unnecessary, or that competition among different concerns in the same trade would tend
							to lower prices, has either been forgotten, or the expected result has been
							circumvented by the formation of trusts and monopolies.</p>
						<p>No absolute rule, no positive standard, has been established, by which the tariff
							question can be said to have been conclusively settled. It is certain that protective
							tariffs have done much to develop our country and to bring prosperity, both to capital
							and labor. On the other hand, it can not be denied that the tariff has given rise to
							abuses, particularly in the enactment of tariff laws. Lobbyists have secured excessive
							tariffs in the interest of favored industries.</p>
						<p>There are times when revenue tariff men find a good argument in the existence of
							unduly high prices, which can be ascribed to protective tariffs. There are other times
							when prices are so low as to make business unprofitable and largely paralyze industry,
							throwing men out of work. At such times the people generally turn toward protection,
							as an aid to the recovery of prosperity, by excluding foreign-made goods from the
							American market.</p>

					<p>It is an accepted principle that taxes for support of Government should be levied
						according to the ability of each taxpayer to pay them. Few forms of taxation conform to
						this principle more exactly than the income tax. Even the general property tax, under
						which a uniform percentage is levied on the property of all persons, is often less
						equitable than the income tax, since property may yield no income whatever and may put
						the owner to great trouble to pay his taxes, even to the extent of having his property
						sold for the purpose. Not so with the income tax, since the tax is not payable unless
						the income is forthcoming, from which it is to be paid. Still the income tax will not
						serve as a substitute for all property taxes, since persons would be encouraged to leave
						property unimproved instead of making it productive of income, with which to pay the tax
						levy. Landowners would be rewarded in many cases by an increase of value on which no
						taxes would be paid, in the absence of a property tax. The Federal Government, through a
						constitutional amendment, now has the power to collect <pb id="VAC1119-097" n="97"/>
						income taxes, but many state Governments have not this power.</p>
					<p>Inheritance taxes are also paid without sacrifice or hardship, since the owner is dead,
						and the tax is practically a fee which the State imposes on the privilege of
						transmitting property to others, either by will or descent.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DANGER OF GRADUATED RATES</head>
						<p>As long as income and inheritance taxes are levied at a uniform rate on all incomes
							and inheritances, no serious controversy arises as to their merits. If a great many
							persons pay the tax, and pay it at the same rate, the amount varying only in
							proportion to the amount of the income or inheritance, it is quite certain that no
							injustice will be attempted against the taxpayer. However, there is a marked tendency
							in late years to graduate the rate of taxes on incomes and inheritances, so that while
							small incomes and small estates pay at a very moderate rate, the rate itself
							increases, more or less rapidly, in proportion to the size of the income or of the
							estate to be inherited. During the World War sixty or even eighty per cent. was taken
							in some countries from those having very large incomes. It was even urged by British
							Socialists, that all income over two thousand five hundred dollars per year should be
							taken by the State.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-098" n="98"/>

						<p>Furthermore, the very smallest incomes are not subject to a tax, partly as a matter
							of public policy, because the tax might interfere with the supply of comforts and even
							necessaries to many families, and partly because the expense of collecting such small
							sums from so many persons amounts to as much or even more than the tax itself
							yields.</p>
						<p>The invention of graduated income and inheritance taxes has led many wealthy persons,
							and many more persons of quite moderate means, to feel the danger of unjust treatment
							to which they are exposed. In a country where such a tax is laid on only a few
							persons, while the whole community possesses the right to vote, persons subject to a
							system of steeply graduated taxes can hardly be blamed for feeling that they are often
							unjustly treated, being made to bear burdens out of proportion to those carried by
							their fellow citizens. Socialists have seized upon the instrument of graduated
							taxation, as a means by which all private property may be lawfully appropriated by the
							Government, without compensation to the owners, thus accomplishing the Social
							Revolution at which they aim, and yet doing so under the forms of law and without
							violence.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ECONOMIC LAW LIMITS TAXING POWER</head>
						<p>Aside from the injustice of an excessive tax burden on a few citizens, while their
							fellows contribute <pb id="VAC1119-099" n="99"/> nothing directly, or an unduly small
							proportion, there are definite economic laws which ought to be observed in imposing
							income and inheritance taxes. If the tax takes an unreasonable part of an income, the
							taxpayer will cease to exert himself to produce the income; and rather than submit to
							gross injustice will see to it, or at least through negligence bring it about, that
							his property yields very little. The high taxes on incomes and profits during the
							World War brought this truth into prominence, as will be shown by a single
							illustration. In a concern, where sixty per cent. of the profits was taken as a tax by
							the Government, there had always been extremely frugal and economical management.
							After the tax was imposed, the offices suddenly took on an air of magnificence. Every
							luxury and convenience were obtained and paid for as part of the expense. Salaries of
							office employees were liberally boosted, and an immense amount of alterations and
							expensive changes were indulged in. The reason was that the Government was paying
							sixty per cent. of all this extra expense. If the expenses had not been incurred and
							profits had been correspondingly increased, sixty per cent. would have gone to the
							Government, as taxes, and only forty per cent. to the owners. It was a good time to
							get these long desired luxuries. Had the tax been <pb id="VAC1119-100" n="100"/>
							eighty or ninety per cent. as many demagogues urged, the temptation to forego profits
							would have been much stronger. The economic law is simply that large incomes and large
							profits are mostly the result of great efforts or great self-denial, and the effort
							will not be forthcoming, the self-denial will not be practised, if the inducements
							which call them forth are destroyed.</p>
						<p>The same principle applies to inheritance taxes. If the tax levied takes too large a
							part of the estate, so that the owner feels he is being unjustly treated, he will find
							a thousand ways to avoid that injustice, by failing to make the efforts and to
							practise self-denial necessary to acquire or to retain large wealth. Economic law
							overrides every other law.</p>
						<p>Every voter will be wise if he stands resolutely in favor of moderation, both in the
							total amount of money to be raised by taxation, and in an unequal or graduated system
							of taxing, under which the rate is different for incomes and estates of different
							size. In time of war and in short periods of great emergency, popular support of
							Government will and ought to cause such unequal burdens, even if the inequality seem
							excessive and unjust, to be borne without complaint, and without successful efforts to
							evade them. In time of peace, only very moderate differences in the rate of taxation,
							should <pb id="VAC1119-101" n="101"/> be permitted. For the same reasons, income taxes
							should extend downward to fairly small incomes, in order that all, or as many as
							possible, should bear a just proportion of the cost of Government, in such a form that
							they are aware of their contribution.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE SINGLE TAX AND INCREMENT TAXES</head>
						<p>A movement for tax reform, so-called, which has come into prominence since the
							publications of Henry George, is known as the demand for the "single tax." The
							advocates of this program who follow Mr. George are now recognized as forming a branch
							of the Socialists, although they do not call themselves such.</p>
						<p>The foundation principle which they assume is that there should be no private
							property in land, and that instead of the present unjust system of private ownership,
							all land should belong to the State. This proposition is also one of the main
							contentions of the Socialists. The followers of Henry George, therefore, propose that
							taxes should be levied wholly on land, it being conceived that in this way the State
							can measurably abolish the injustice of private ownership. The single taxer hopes to
							relieve all other forms of property from the burden of taxation, and he also aims to
							transfer largely, if not wholly, the value of land now privately <pb id="VAC1119-102"
								n="102"/> owned, from the owner to the State, by taking all or a great part of the
							annual rental value of the land in the form of taxes. It will be seen that this taking
							of property by taxation, for the purpose and with the result of substituting State
							ownership for private ownership is a central doctrine of modem Socialism.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE THEORY OF SINGLE TAX</head>
						<p>The theoretical doctrine of the single taxer is that all men are equally entitled to
							share in the land, which is the bounty of nature, like air and sunshine. Unhappily,
							human society, and the feeding, clothing and housing of its members on a basis of
							justice and of peace, is a very practical undertaking, which centuries of experience
							have shown can not be successfully carried forward on mere abstract theories of
							natural justice. Since the use of land requires the application of labor to the land,
							the practical question is, what arrangements, laws and institutions are best adapted
							to induce men to labor? Is private property in land or is the Government ownership of
							land the better arrangement, in the light of human experience?</p>
						<p>Another argument for the single tax, which has impressed more persons than the theory
							of natural rights, is the doctrine of social value, or <pb id="VAC1119-103" n="103"/>
							unearned increment. Every one knows how land, which has been purchased for a small
							sum, at a time when the population was small, has risen in value by reason of the mere
							increase in population. This may happen, even though the landowner has never made the
							slightest effort to improve or to use his land, either for his own benefit or that of
							the community.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FARMERS' OBJECTION TO SINGLE TAX</head>
						<p>The doctrine of the single taxers has found little support, outside of those persons
							who believe in Socialism. The farmers of America quickly saw the injustice of levying
							all taxes on land. The farmer does occasionally have times of great prosperity, but he
							also has bad years, when crops are poor or prices low. However, all years are alike on
							the farm, in that they are years of hard labor. The heat of summer can not be avoided,
							if the harvest is to be gathered. Short days of six or even eight hours' labor will
							not suffice, if hay and grain are to be harvested in time to prevent their
							destruction. Even in planting time, long days of plowing are necessary, if the seed is
							to be put in when the weather permits in time to yield sufficient crops for feeding,
							not merely the farmer's family, but also those who live in cities, or are employed in
							factories, on railroads, <pb id="VAC1119-104" n="104"/> in mines and other forms of
							industry. Now farmers, while they usually get a comfortable living as a result of
							their arduous toil, caring for the stock and crops, milking cows, late and early,
							whatever the season or the weather, do not as a rule become particularly rich. They
							could see nothing but injustice in the proposal to tax their property, consisting
							almost wholly of land, while personal property, stocks, bonds, mortgages, office
							buildings, hotels, dwellings, stocks of goods. in ware-houses and department stores,
							ships, in short, every kind of property except land, escaped all taxation. Such also
							has been the view of nine-tenths of the American people. In his <hi rend="i">Taxation
								and the New State</hi>, J. A. Hobson, the English radical, points out the iniquity
							of the single tax, under which one man's savings of a thousand pounds, if invested in
							land, would be wiped out, while his neighbor's like investment in industrial stock
							would go scot free.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DIFFICULTIES OF INCREMENT TAX</head>
						<p>One part of the single tax argument was not so easy to answer, namely that which
							pointed to the increased value of well located city property. It was said that the
							owner toiled not, neither did he spin, to produce this great increase of value, which
							had come into existence merely from the growth of <pb id="VAC1119-105" n="105"/>
							population. The most obvious answer, and a true one, was that this unearned increase
							of value arose in many other cases, and was not confined to land. Many industries
							beginning small, when the city was small, have grown to great size with the growth of
							the city. Banks, newspapers, department stores, groceries, in short, almost every kind
							of business in a growing city exhibit the element of increased earnings arising from
							mere growth of population.</p>
						<p>Attempts to tax the unearned increment in land have been made in Germany and England
							by taking a percentage on the increase in value of the land. Germany imposed a tax of
							thirty per cent. and Great Britain twenty per cent.<ref id="ref_003" rend="super"
								target="note_003">*</ref> This seemed fair enough, but experience showed that men,
							under such a law, refused to sell their property, so that land did not pass freely to
							those who could make the best use of it, a thing most important for the public
							interest. Since profits on sales of land may be counted as part of the income of the
							seller, laws imposing taxes on incomes or profits reach the unearned increment of
							land, and make it yield the same proportion of tax as the rest of the seller's income.
							Unhappily, it has been discovered that large income and profit taxes have the same
							effect <note id="note_003"><ref target="ref_003" rend="super">*</ref>Abandonment of
								this tax was proposed by the British chancellor of the exchequer April 19, 1920,
								because of its failure as a revenue producer.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-106" n="106"/> in preventing sales, on a large scale, of land, stocks
							or other forms of wealth, that the straight tax on unearned increment has. People will
							not sell, thereby avoiding the taking of profit in large transactions, and to that
							extent reduce the volume of general prosperity.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST SINGLE TAX</head>
						<p>There is, however, a still more complete answer to the argument of the single taxer.
							Henry George held that the growth in land values operated constantly to draw to the
							landowner the wealth of the rest of the community, who were compelled to pay higher
							and higher rents for the privilege of a place on this planet. Therefore, George held
							that the unearned increment of land value produced an extreme concentration of wealth
							at one end of society in the hands of the landlord, and a constantly increasing mass
							of poverty at the other end of the social scale. This serious charge was, however, not
							based on any statistics, any scientific proof of the proposition from an actual study
							of the facts.</p>
						<p>We now know that George's supposition was entirely wrong. In 1860, the percentage of
							rent to the whole national income received by labor, capital, land and industry, was
							8.8 per cent. Since 1860 the growth in national wealth has been enormous, and the
							total annual income is at least ten times as <pb id="VAC1119-107" n="107"/> great. Yet
							in 1910, the percentage which rent took of the whole annual income of the nation, was
							precisely what it had been fifty years before, namely 8.8 per cent. In other words,
							land income has not grown in value any more rapidly than any other income.<ref
								id="ref_004" rend="super" target="note_004">*</ref> It is true we can find
							individual cases of excessive unearned increase in land values, but it is also true
							that we can find many more cases of decline in land values. Land is subject to
							fluctuations in value, both up and down, like everything else.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DANGERS OF RADICAL TAXATION</head>
						<p>It is obvious to every fair-minded student of politics and social tendencies, that
							the power of taxation is one which revolutionists are attempting to seize and utilize.
							In other times, the one instrument for revolution was the army. In our time a new one,
							the tax law, is quite as much to be dreaded. In fact, the power to tax is quite as
							able to destroy private property, and the existing social order, as the Red Armies of
							Lenine. The taxing power is in fact more dangerous than military force. When a
							revolutionary army attempts to overthrow a Government, no argument is needed to
							explain to the people what is threatened. Every man, however humble, every woman,
							however feminine and secluded, knows at a glance that a revolutionary <note
								id="note_004"><ref target="ref_004" rend="super">*</ref><hi rend="i">Wealth and
									Income of People of the United States</hi>. By W. I. King. Pages 160-162.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-108" n="108"/> army is about. Not so with the tax systems of the
							revolutionist. He comes armed with lawful authority. He uses no violence and creates
							no disorder. A large part of the people are not disturbed by attentions from the tax
							officer of the revolution. They have no property to be taxed or taken by him.</p>
						<p>Moreover, revolution by taxation is gradual in its process. A coup d' état
							accomplished by an army means the sudden death of the existing Government; revolution
							by taxation means a slow process, like starvation. At first only a few individuals,
							perhaps the very rich, will see their property taken, under forms of law. Then more
							persons, this time those of moderate means, will suffer. Gradually the process will
							extend downward throughout the whole mass of society. All, or nearly all, property
							will have passed to the Government. Freedom will have perished. The Government will be
							the only property holder. Industry will be in the hands of politicians. Competition in
							industrial effort and skill will be replaced by competition in political effort and
							skill. Bureaucracy will have replaced Democracy.</p>
						<p>Therefore, voters should watch the exercise of the taxing power with the utmost
							vigilance to the end that it be used for the just support of the Government, and not
							for a revolution in disguise.</p>

							thing that is thy neighbor's."</p>
						<p>Private ownership of property, as distinguished from ownership by the Government, or
							community, rests upon the foundation of utility. It is more advantageous, more useful

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">POVERTY OF AMERICAN PIONEERS</head>
						<p>The natural state of man is one of utter poverty. The history of America is a recent
							and modern repetition of human experience, in all lands and ages. The first colonists,
							or settlers, finding themselves in a continent of inestimable natural resources, were
							everywhere utterly poor. At first, they lived in tents, dressed in the skins of
							animals and ate such fish and game, such nuts and berries, as they could get, to
							supplement the small stores which they had <pb id="VAC1119-111" n="111"/> brought with
							them. Then came the log cabin, the clearing in the forest, the planting and gathering
							of meager crops, the weaving, in the home, of rough goods, for home-made clothing. As
							yet there were no roads, no schools and no towns. A traveler who went from New York to
							Louisville about 1820 records that he found amazing poverty in the frontier
							settlements. Often an entire village would lack blankets for an extra bed for the
							traveler, nor could they well spare bread, meat or potatoes for his meals.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PRESENT ABUNDANCE AND ITS CAUSES</head>
						<p>All this has long since changed, and evidences of wealth and comfort abound in every
							part of the United States. What brought about this change? Undoubtedly, it was the
							result of human effort. It is in the human will that we find the source of all
							production of wealth. Whatever stimulates effort, whatever most encourages energy is
							what the world needs to lift itself from poverty to comfort. The existing wealth which
							we see all about us is the result not merely of manual labor but of manual labor
							directed by superior intelligence. No matter how hard the unskilled laborer may toil
							in the wilderness, he will not greatly improve his position unless he possesses more
							than average intelligence, by the light of which he directs his work. Even men of
							average <pb id="VAC1119-112" n="112"/> intelligence, left to themselves, could not
							have produced the miraculous transformation of America from a savage wilderness to a
							highly civilized and wealthy country. Such a gigantic task was for gigantic men, who,
							possessing extraordinary, natural gifts, were able to and did direct the work of less
							gifted men into the most useful lines.</p>
						<p>We owe our present national wealth not only to human effort, mental and physical,
							applied to the raising of crops, the building of railroads and factories, and the
							like, but also to the fact that those who have gone before and achieved this amazing
							result exercised severe self-restraint, in that they saved a part of the product of
							their labor and put it into enduring form for their posterity.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CONDITIONS OF FUTURE PROGRESS</head>
						<p>Therefore, improvement in the condition of humankind requires such a social system as
							will best stimulate effort, mental and physical, and organize that effort so as to
							secure the highest efficiency. There is also needed whatever will most encourage
							thrift, the habit of saving, the practise of consuming, from day to day, a part only
							of what has been produced, thus preserving as much as possible for permanent increase
							in the world's stock of wealth.</p>
						<p>"Work and Save" has been the program by <pb id="VAC1119-113" n="113"/> which America
							has achieved success. Whatever encourages working and saving helps to improve the
							comfort, and increase the abundance which we all desire and need. Whatever discourages
							working and saving, helps to decrease the supply of comforts, and to lessen the
							available amount of the good things of life. Whenever men begin to demand an easier
							way of living, shorter hours of labor, fewer work days, more holidays, they choose the
							path' which leads backward, toward the poverty of the pioneers. Working and saving, to
							the utmost limit, compatible with health and the right kind of enjoyment and
							happiness, is indeed the straight and narrow path, but it is the path that leads to
							more abundance. The path of ease and indolence, of less work and more play, is the
							path which is broad and easy, but it leads downward to poverty. This is true, not only
							for individuals, but for communities and nations. Our system of private property with
							its rewards and encouragements for individual effort and self-denial has been an
							essential element of American progress.</p>

							so it does. This inequality is declared <pb id="VAC1119-114" n="114"/> dared by Marx
							to be unjust, since all labor is of equal value. The answer is that this assumption of
							the equal value of different kinds of labor is false. The value of labor must be
							measured by its utility to the whole community. A farmer who uses improved implements
							and, as a result, raises a hundred bushels of corn, is clearly rendering more valuable
							service to the community than his neighbor who, without improved implements but with
							the same amount of labor, succeeds only in raising ten bushels.</p>
						<p>A shoemaker, on his bench, who can make by hand one pair of shoes with so many hours
							of work, certainly does not benefit the community nearly so much as the inventor who
							designs machines which will produce a hundred pairs of shoes in the same time with the
							same labor. So, also, the man who directs only his own labor is of less value to the
							community than the man who can organize industry so that multitudes of men will be
							able to cooperate in production. Some will raise cattle; some will slaughter; some
							will tan the hides; some build machinery; some will use the machinery which turns the
							leather into shoes. The total result of this cooperative industry, under our present
							system is that in the place of one pair of shoes, produced by a certain amount of
							manual labor, we will have a hundred pairs, better in quality and cheaper in
							price.</p>

						<p>Again, if we were to provide by law that one yard of poor cloth should sell for the
							same price as a yard of fine cloth, there would be no inducement to make fine cloth,
							and none would be made. If an inventor, or captain of industry, knew that his utmost
							exertion would only yield him the reward of ordinary unskilled labor, he would
							inevitably perform merely the work of an unskilled laborer. There might be occasional
							exceptions, but in a Socialist State, where every child learned from infancy that
							slight effort would be rewarded quite as highly as great effort, the whole average of
							exertion and of production would rapidly fall. A person can learn to perform the work
							of unskilled labor in a day or two, but it takes many years of intensive study and
							training to produce a great engineer or chemist. If all were to receive equal rewards,

						<head rend="center sc">PRIVATE PROPERTY STIMULATES THRIFT</head>
						<p>Our system of private property, ,rewarding effort according to its value, has been

							can invest his savings in loans which will bring him interest, in land which will
							bring him rent, or in business which will bring him profits, is encouraged to save for
							such investments, <pb id="VAC1119-116" n="116"/> because he can then look forward,

						<head rend="center sc">AGE OF INVENTION AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATION</head>
						<p>The proof of the success of our system of property, in the encouragement of both
							production and saving, is found in the history of our country from Colonial days to
							the present time. But by far the greater part of our progress has been made since
							1776. In that year, two events took place, the signing of the Declaration of
							Independence and the publication of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. One was the
							declaration of our political freedom, the other a reasoned statement of the laws of
							economic freedom. Certain it is that after these two events, and particularly after
							the French Revolution of 1789, with its political and economic gospel of emancipation
							for the people of Europe, the productivity <pb id="VAC1119-117" n="117"/> of labor
							suddenly leaped to heights before undreamed of. The age of mechanical invention was
							ushered in, to be followed by the age of creative business organization. Wealth began
							to be produced in amounts previously quite impossible. Machinery replaced hand labor,
							the railroad supplanted the stage-coach. The steam engine, followed a century later by
							the gas engine, came to perform the work of millions of hand laborers. Few can doubt
							that this amazing awakening of the human mind, and direction of its energies toward
							the production of wealth, was closely connected with the dawn of the modern age of
							political freedom. It was, without doubt, cause and effect, in that the new freedom
							awakened and stimulated human intelligence to a degree and kind of effort which had no

						<head rend="center sc">NEW WEALTH BENEFITS ALL</head>
						<p>This new wealth, though so unequally distributed, because unequally produced, was

							for talent and industry to rise from unskilled labor to the full use of their powers,
							was never before so freely opened and so widely enjoyed. The age of machinery and of

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">POLITICAL: COMPETITION VERSUS INDUSTRIAL COMPETITION</head>
						<p>Compare such a system of selection with what Socialism offers as a substitute. It

						<p>Herbert Hoover states that the various sorts of Socialism are based on the notion
							that productivity can be maintained under altruism, or unselfishness, and that the

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF INDUSTRY</head>
						<p>Another way of phrasing the Socialist demand is "the Democratic Control of Industry."
							The truth is, that we now have a far more democratic control of industry than we have
							of politics. It is the demand of the whole people, their needs, their desires, even
							their whims and fancies, which determine what shall be manufactured, in what fashion
							and quantity and the value or price of the thing. All the people, men and women and
							children, who have their needs and whims, have a voice in this universal democratic

							public will, or <note id="note_006"><ref target="ref_006" rend="super">*</ref><hi

							<pb id="VAC1119-123" n="123"/> demand, cooperating with the natural supply of talent,
							and of persons who have had the necessary training. The various kinds of work which
							are performed in the world are being constantly appraised and valued by society at
							large. That the result must be near what is natural, reasonable and just, is apparent.
							Carpenters, machinists, engineers and bricklayers, spinners, weavers, designers and
							unskilled labor, all have much the same relation to one another, in every modern
							country, if the various rates of compensation be compared.</p>
						<p>Socialists mean something quite different from all this, by the democratic control of
							industry. They mean that the workmen shall choose and dismiss their managers and
							foremen. This involves the substitution of political skill in getting votes, for
							industrial skill in the performance of work. Thus the world's industry, instead of
							being controlled and made productive by the direction of master minds, chosen by the
							hard processes of competition, will be controlled by the multitudes who possess no
							qualifications or fitness for the duties of industrial management. After the French
							Revolution of 1848, the experiment of Government workshops was tried, in response to
							popular demand. The control of the factories which were engaged in making uniforms,
							was placed in the employees. They chose <pb id="VAC1119-124" n="124"/> their own
							foreman and superintendents, and made their own rules. After a year or two of
							disorganization and lack of discipline, the shops were closed. It was proved by actual

						<head rend="center sc">THE RUIN OF RUSSIA</head>
						<p>It seems probable that for many years, perhaps for many centuries to come, the

							the ruin which Socialism has wrought in Russia.</p>
						<p>A French Socialist went to Russia to observe what was taking place. He had every

							likewise gone down........... Bolshevism has been able to engender only famine and

							things be otherwise since the Russian peasant, worn out by <pb id="VAC1119-125"

								cemetery."<ref id="ref_007" rend="super" target="note_007">*</ref></p>
						<p>Amid the conflicting accounts of what has occurred in Russia, some things seem
							certain. Peasants refused to sell food to the cities and take worthless paper money
							for it, although they were willing, it seems, to exchange for manufactured articles.
							The cities had nothing to exchange, because they produced nothing. Factories were
							seized by the workmen. Owners and managers were driven off or killed. Workmen,
							choosing their own bosses, making their own rules as to wages, hours and other
							conditions of labor, achieved nothing but failure.</p>
						<p>To meet this, Lenine declared he would put dictators in the factories, and said the
							employees should have nothing to say about wages, hours of labor, or other conditions,
							but must work as they were ordered by the dictator. The dictator is understood to have
							been from the old managerial class which the Government had undertaken to banish, and,
							to secure him, an enormous salary was necessary. Thus the democratic control of

						<p>Not only the Utopian romances of earlier and more recent times are flavored with this

						<p>The reason for all this is not far to seek. One of the strongest bulwarks of the
							institution of private property is the family. Love prompts a man to exert himself to
							the utmost throughout life to provide for and protect his wife and children. Plainly,
							if private property is to be done away with and the State is to take over nearly every
							form of property, the family, as we have it, must go. Children must be cared for by
							the State, lest the father be too much interested in working and saving for their

							want his own separate estate, for his wife.</p>

							<pb id="VAC1119-135" n="135"/> "What is property? It is robbery," wrote the Frenchman,
							Proudhon, in 1840. "Rob the Robbers," echoes Lenine in 19i8 in Russia. Accordingly, it
							appears that practically all owners of every kind of private property in Soviet Russia
							have been violently dispossessed without compensation. Lands and houses, forests and
							minerals, live stock, agricultural tools, banks and their assets, railroads,

						<p>Moderate Socialists, however, claim that by the abolition of private property, it is

						<head rend="center sc">MODERATE SOCIALISM IS DECEPTIVE</head>
						<p>The two methods on which moderate Socialists chiefly rely to secure a peaceful and

								<item>Taxation in various forms and steeply graduated so as to transfer a large part

							</list></p>
						<p>Can the claim of moderate Socialists that they propose to compensate owners for
							property taken, be relied upon? John Spargo, moderate Socialist, speaking of hoarded
							wealth says, "The inheritance of <pb id="VAC1119-139" n="139"/> such accumulated
							property would, however, necessarily be denied, society being the only possible
							inheritor of property." Whether private property be taken at the death of a living
							owner by complete abolition of inheritance and the right to make a will, so that the
							whole estate would escheat to the State, or whether it be taken more slowly, by large
							inheritance taxes or transmission taxes, is a negligible difference. It is a question
							merely of confiscating all at once, or a step at a time. Lenine took the shorter
							process, the Russian Soviet law providing "inheritance, whether by law or by will is
								abolished."<ref id="ref_022" rend="super" target="note_022">*</ref></p>
						<p>Single taxers, led by Henry George, have proposed to transfer all taxation to land
							and to make the tax equal to the entire rental value of the property. Can any
							fair-minded person see a substantial difference between this method and pure
							confiscation?</p>
						<p>J. Ramsay Macdonald, moderate, says, "The Socialist denies that he proposes a policy
							of confiscation. Is he not, however, to confiscate as a matter of fact ? The State did
							not confiscate when the telegraphs were nationalised, nor does it propose to
							confiscate the telephone service in a few months from now. Switzerland did not
							confiscate the railways when it nationalised them. Neither Glasgow nor London
							confiscated their trams when they municipalised them. If there had been a shadow of
							confiscation <note id="note_022"><ref target="ref_022" rend="super">*</ref><hi

							were the victims, not the shareholders."<ref id="ref_023" rend="super"
								target="note_023">*</ref></p>
						<p>The fallacy of the argument that Socialism will not confiscate, is shown in the last
							sentence above quoted. The property of the taxpayers was taken, in order to compensate
							the owners of telephones and trams. But who will compensate ,the taxpayers? The answer
							formerly was that the state or city, operating telephones, trams or railroads would
							operate them at a profit. This profit would go into the public treasury, and thus, by
							lightening the burden of taxation, in effect, compensate the taxpayer for what he had
							been compelled to pay in taxes. This argument would have merit, if it were true. It is
							not true.</p>
						<p>Certain European states and cities, particularly in Germany, proceeded, in the
							lifetime of the present generation, to nationalize or municipalize some forms of
							industry, such as railroads, street-car lines, telephones and telegraph lines. These
							were sometimes operated with sufficient economy and business judgment to yield a
							profit to the public treasury. Thereupon, Socialist writers began to say that the
							people, or the proletariat, had not been benefited by the change. The cry arose
							against "State Capitalism." It was said that the employees of State railroads <note
								id="note_023"><ref target="ref_023" rend="super">*</ref><hi rend="i">The Socialist
									Movement</hi>. Macdonald. Page 160.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-141" n="141"/> did not have any better wages, or conditions of labor,
							than before. They did not fix their own wages, when employed by the state or city, any
							more than they did when employed by private persons or corporations. Everywhere it was
							proclaimed that mere transfer of ownership and control from private to public hands
							after compensating former owners, was not Socialism at all, but only capitalism in a
							new form.</p>
						<p>To meet this, two remedies have been suggested by Socialist writers, either of which,
							if put in practise, utterly destroys the pretense that Socialism will reimburse
							taxpayers, who are made to pay the purchase price of nationalized or municipalized
							property. The first method is to operate all public undertakings, such as railroads,
							street-cars, waterworks and the like, at cost. In this way the profit disappears, the
							taxpayer receives nothing to compensate him for his special tax contributions to the
							purchase price, but the general public does get the benefit of reduction in rates, if
							there be a reduction.</p>
						<p>But Socialist writers have found little comfort in a mere reduction of cost of
							service to the public, or to the consumer. Nor do they find any satisfaction in the
							cooperative system, because they say it benefits only the consumer. The same objection
							was made to it, as to the operation of public utilities by <pb id="VAC1119-142"
								n="142"/> the Government at cost. They said that employees of cooperative stores
							were just like the employees of any private concern. They did not fix their own wages,
							nor their own hours or conditions of labor, and were just as much as ever under the
							control of capital. In short, what Socialists really and finally demand, in the last
							analysis, is that the profits of every industry shall go to the workers in that
							industry. This was the precise plan and purpose of French Syndicalism, and of Russian
							Bolshevism.</p>
						<p>We have had, as every one knows, a Bolshevist movement in this country, looking to
							direct overthrow of the Government. We have also had a Syndicalist movement, carried
							on by such organizations as the I. W. W. Few people realize that the appropriation of
							the profits of industry to the workers in that industry has been proposed and
							advocated in America under the forms of law.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE PLUMB PLAN FOR RAILROADS</head>
						<p>In August, 1919, American labor leaders presented to Congress a plan for the purchase
							of railroads, owners to be compensated from the proceeds of a sale of United States
							bonds. These bonds and the interest thereon would, of course, be a Government paid by
							the taxpayers. The interesting part of the <pb id="VAC1119-143" n="143"/> proposal was
							twofold. First, the control of the railroads, by a board of directors, was firmly
							fixed in the employees of the roads, since only one-third of the directors were to be
							appointed by the Government, representing the whole people, including taxpayers, and
							two-thirds by the employees. This, of course, would give railroad employees practical
							and effective control over their own wages, hours of labor and conditions of work. The
							second interesting feature was that the profits were to go to the workers, up to five
							per cent. of the gross income. Any profit above this should be applied to
							improvements, or to a reduction of rates charged the public.</p>
						<p>It will be seen that, as no part of the profits was to go to the Government, which
							had paid for the roads, no part of them would go to pay the bonds or interest, out of
							which, or their proceeds, the railroad owners had been compensated. In other words the
							taxpayer would not be compensated for his special forced contribution. In the second
							place, the employees would prefer to fix wages so high that they would get all of the
							profits. This would be much quicker, surer and more advantageous than to leave
							something for profits. Profits would be uncertain in amount, postponed as to time of
							payment, and, most important of all, would go to the employees only in part.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-144" n="144"/>

						<p>The advocates of the Plumb Plan, although proposing no violence, and intending to
							observe the forms of law, and to compensate the owners of the railroads to the extent
							of their appraised value, actually would take the property of the taxpayers, without
							compensation, and give it to the railroad employees.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CONCLUSION</head>
						<p>The conclusion is inevitable, that while the methods of moderate Socialists differ
							from the radicals, their aims are the same, and are all the more dangerous because
							covered with a deceptive appearance of fairness, legality, order and
							constitutionality.</p>
						<p>In support of the view that moderate Socialist propaganda is quite likely to lead
							people to more and more radical opinions, attention is called to the interview carried
							by the Associated Press on December 18th, 1919, with Thomas Buhkanob, the
							seventeen-year old Russian anarchist. This boy, who had lived in America five years,
							had attended New York's public schools, and said he earned twenty-one dollars a week,
							talked frankly on the subject of his revolutionary views. He declared himself opposed
							to any form of Government, even though it protected his life and property, enabled him
							to earn a good living and to dwell in peace and comfort. He said that a police or fire
							department, a street cleaning system, <pb id="VAC1119-145" n="145"/> water-works, a
							lighting system or any other public service would be acceptable to him only if they
							did not involve the exercise of "authority." He had no sympathy for Bolshevism even,
							because it represented a form of Government or authority, for both of which he
							professed contempt. When asked what led him to hold such views, he answered that "the
							first step had been Socialism, a theory favored by some of the teachers in his New
							York public school. It was not radical enough," he said, "and so he took up
							anarchy."</p>
						<p>That the relations between mild Socialism and radical Bolshevism are much closer than
							many good people suspect, is shown by the statement of Doctor Michael Misleg,
							Treasurer of the Russian Radical Novy Mir, on which Trotzsky worked before leaving New
							York, to join the revolution in Russia. Misleg who was sent to jail for contempt, told
							the joint legislative committee of investigation that "Bolshevism and Socialism are
							synonymous and Socialism is the ideal Government."<ref id="ref_024" rend="super"

					<p>Some of our best citizens who are utterly opposed to Socialism, nevertheless favor
						Government ownership of certain industries, as for instance, railroads, telegraphs,
						telephones or coal mines. They say that we may have Government ownership and operation,
						without having Socialism, and that the question, with regard to any particular industry,
						is merely one of expediency. This is true, in theory. It is impossible to say that the
						Government might not own and operate railways without becoming Socialistic. If the
						railroads were so operated, on such a basis of profit as would pay the principal and
						interest on the price paid for the railroads, it would not be Socialism, but has been
						correctly called "State Capitalism" by the Socialists themselves.</p>
					<p>Such an ideal result, however, seems most improbable. It is true that the Government
						has built the Panama Canal, has constructed harbors, improved rivers, operates the
						post-office, light-houses, the coast guard, an army and a navy. It has, in time of war,
						operated the railroads, although at an enormous loss, in spite of increased rates to the
						public and restricted service. So also, local Governments <pb id="VAC1119-147" n="147"/>
						conduct public schools, fire departments and hospitals, besides maintaining police
						forces, building roads, sewers, bridges and the like.</p>
					<p>As we consider this list of Government enterprises, we notice at once that they are
						never conducted for profit. The post-office department is supposed to pay its own way.
						The Panama Canal is operated at a loss. Most public services, such as fire and police
						protection, the use of highways and sewers, of hospitals and schools, the security
						afforded by army and navy and coast patrol, are all free.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GOVERNMENT WASTE</head>
						<p>The absence of profit, as an object of Government enterprise, has the natural result
							of extravagance. To be sure, there are exceptions, but they are few and far between.
							It is a pitiful fact that all our public enterprises tend to a standard of
							expensiveness and inefficiency, far below results obtained in private business.</p>
						<p>Spargo, who has unceasingly advocated Socialism, Collectivism and State ownership
							and operation of all the means of production, transport and exchange, when confronted
							by this difficulty, makes the following significant assertion. "Government industrial
							enterprise, as we know it, has succeeded, on the whole, even less well than capitalist
							industrial <pb id="VAC1119-148" n="148"/> enterprise. It has been extravagant and
							uneconomical; it has developed a formidable bureaucracy; it has been marked by
							favoritism and other evils attendant upon political influence."<ref id="ref_025"
								rend="super" target="note_025">*</ref></p>
						<p>The controlling cause of Government extravagance and inefficiency, on the economic
							side, is the absence of the profit motive, that spur which continually urges the
							manager of private business to make war on waste and to fight for efficiency. Another
							cause for failure in public enterprise is that the men in charge are chosen for
							political reasons. If we add to these certain elements, the highly probable one that
							Government operation for profit will be assailed by the public who, already educated
							to having Government service free or at cost, will demand the lowest rates, we see the
							difficulty growing. To this must be added the demand of Socialists and trade unionists
							that the profits of industry should be transferred to the workers in that industry.
							Reasonable people should realize that profits in Government enterprise are not to be
							relied on.</p>
						<p>Our experience in Government operation of railroads, which resulted in hundreds of
							millions of dollars' loss each year, is corroborated by like experience of the British
							and Canadian Governments. Aside from the railroad experiment, it must be remembered
								<note id="note_025"><ref target="ref_025" rend="super">*</ref><hi rend="i">The
									Psychology of Bolshevism</hi>. John Spargo. Page 60.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-149" n="149"/> that practically none of the Government enterprises
							mentioned at the beginning of this chapter as already in existence consists of
							productive business. The placing of production, of the necessaries of life, in the
							hands of the Government would be the sheerest experiment, failure in which would mean
							a rapid decline of the supplies of food, fuel, clothing, shelter, in short, of all
							that we know as essential for life and health.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE GOVERNMENT AS LANDOWNER</head>
						<p>All Socialists, including Lenine, admit that land owned by the Government must
							nevertheless be used by individuals. The Russian Soviet Constitution provides for
							allotting the use of land among the people. The fertility and amount of land, and the
							number of persons in the family receiving the allotment who are able to work, are all
							to be considered. Some such plan would have to be adopted by any Government which
							became the universal landlord. Let any man who has a knowledge of practical politics
							in an American community, reflect upon the probable distribution of land by political
							methods under Government control. Electioneering art, rather than business ability,
							would be the means by which most men would gain authority to distribute the land, and
							this would quickly come to be treated as patronage.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-150" n="150"/>

						<p>Now, the interest of society will be best served if land goes to those who are able
							to make the best use of it. Society is not concerned in the equal distribution of
							land, but rather in the really able farmer having as many acres as he can manage,
							because he will produce the largest crops and the most cattle.</p>
						<p>Society needs to have persons who can not conduct successful farms left without
							land and placed under the direction of the able and intelligent farmer. It is plain
							that Government ownership and distribution of land would not secure this result. On
							the contrary, such a decline of production would take place as to make starvation and
							famine a probability.</p>
						<p>The Russian Soviet Constitution speaks of "borrowers of land," who are the persons to
							whom the land has been allotted. Such a name is correct. Would not a person who
							borrowed land from the Government, whose tenure is uncertain, who can not transfer it
							to others, either in life or in death, be inclined to get as much as he can in a short
							time, without regard to decline in fertility? And would not the deterioration of land
							be another cause for scarcity and famine?</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OUR GOVERNMENT LAND POLICY</head>
						<p>It should not be forgotten that our Federal Government formerly owned nearly all the
							land in this <pb id="VAC1119-151" n="151"/> country west of the Alleghanies. Some of
							it was granted to soldiers of the Revolutionary War, as reward for services, and some
							was reserved for Indian tribes. Most of it went in small farms to actual settlers,
							under laws authorizing such grants. Since there was for a long time an abundance of
							land for all who wanted it, either for the purpose of actual settlement or as a
							purchase at a nominal price, the distribution took place rapidly and fairly.</p>
						<p>However, it was seen, as a result of the Civil War, that railroads were a supreme
							necessity, both to build up the country, and to strengthen the military connection
							between its different parts. Accordingly, as private capital hesitated to embark in
							the hazardous enterprise of building railroads thousands of miles long through a
							country having neither cities, towns, nor settled population of any kind, it devolved
							upon the Government either to build the roads itself, or to procure them to be
							built.</p>
						<p>The latter policy was adopted. Public lands were granted, generally in alternate
							sections, and for a considerable distance on either side of the route for the proposed
							new railroad, as an inducement for railroad construction. An empire of land was thus
							given away to railroad builders. It was magnificent extravagance, by no means free
							from official corruption. It was successful. The several railroads <pb
								id="VAC1119-152" n="152"/> to the Pacific, thus lavishly endowed, were built. But
							the whole chapter of our western railroad land grants is an impressive illustration of
							the way Government does business. Results are indeed often secured which are of noble
							proportions, but the waste which seems inseparable from Government activities is
							manifest in that chapter of American history on a scale which defies concealment. With
							such a record of land ownership and administration by the Government, we should
							hesitate before we place all the land once more in its hands.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS</head>
						<p>While few persons advocate Government ownership of land, a considerable number
							incline to favor Government ownership of railways. Our experience in such Government
							operations, during the Great War, which resulted in increased rates to the public,
							decreased efficiency of service, and an appalling deficit, are indeed serious warnings
							against such a policy in times of peace, but even such experience does not convince
							everybody.</p>
						<p>Let us try to imagine what our railroads would be like if Government ownership and
							operation were adopted as a permanent national policy. To begin with, even at the risk
							of repetition, let us remember that the guiding principle of the private owner is <pb
								id="VAC1119-153" n="153"/> economic interest, that is, he is controlled chiefly by
							the fear of pecuniary loss and the hope for pecuniary gain. We may be sure that the
							guiding principle of the Government would not be economic interest, but political
							interest, with the result of greatly increased expenses and greatly decreased
							efficiency.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">IMPROVEMENTS AND EXTENSIONS</head>
						<p>Railroads constitute the greatest single industry in America. They use more capital,
							take in more revenue, let more contracts and pay out more money, than is done in any
							other business. They are the greatest users of steel products and the greatest
							consumers of coal. When in Government hands, how would the questions of building new
							railroads, and of improving and extending old roads, be determined? In this, we have a
							guide to the correct answer of much importance in the record made in Congress for many
							years past in the matter of legislation for the improvement of rivers and harbors. We
							know that this is the scandal of both parties. Political interests of members have
							dictated river and harbor improvements in so many instances as to make the whole
							matter a national joke, if it were not a national shame. Whichever party is in power
							has managed to secure the expenditure of large sums in the states of its influential
								<pb id="VAC1119-154" n="154"/> members. In one case, a navy yard was located on a
							dangerous river and a million dollar dry-dock built for very large vessels, only to
							have it discovered that a granite ledge in the river made it impossible to bring ships
							of suitable size to the dry-dock until vast sums had been spent in blowing up the
							ledge. This is only one of many thousand examples of money unwisely spent to promote
							political interest. We may be sure that the same thing would be likely to happen in
							respect to the improvement or construction of railroads and railroad facilities. Roads
							would most likely be built where they served politics rather than business.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SUPPLY CONTRACTS</head>
						<p>When it came to the letting of contracts, there would likewise be an absence of
							economic interest, and to a large extent, the presence of political influence. Party
							favorites would be likely to benefit. We need only look about us and remember how the
							public has often suffered in the letting of contracts for building roads and bridges,
							court-houses, post-offices, schoolhouses and the like. Even matters of school supplies
							and supplies for fire and street cleaning departments, and other of the smaller but
							still important branches of Government work have by no means been free from waste and
							corruption.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OPERATION OF RAILROADS</head>
						<p>We can not justly close our eyes to the influences of political interest on railroad
							operation, in the employment of men, their discipline and discharge. The private
							owner, guided by economic interest, is influenced by considerations of efficiency and
							of discipline. He is alert to weed out the inefficient members of his force, and to
							discover, reward and promote the efficient ones. With Government in control, there
							will always be present the temptation to retain or to employ men who are good
							politicians, good vote-getters and party workers, even though they possess neither the
							qualifications nor the industry for good railroad work.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FACILITIES UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTROL</head>
						<p>In the matter of furnishing facilities to the patrons, it can not be unlikely that
							the Government, guided by political interests, will play party favorites. The
							temptation to furnish cars to a mine owner, who is a political supporter of the
							administration, and to withhold them from a political adversary, will always be
							present and will not always be resisted. If we consider the thousands of factories,
							mines, packing houses, mercantile houses and all other forms of industry, which are
							dependent on railroads for their daily supply of <pb id="VAC1119-156" n="156"/> cars,
							we can see at once the power which the administration will wield, in withholding or
							furnishing cars, according to whether patrons are tractable and give their support to
							the administration, or not. The same considerations will be likely to influence the
							character of service on the railroads in the various states. The temptation to favor

						<head rend="center sc">RAILROAD DEFICITS AND PUBLIC BURDENS</head>
						<p>As we have seen in our chapter on The Burden of Taxes, all the extravagance, all the

							roads in higher rates, but it is not improbable, that, guided by political interests,

							to conceal losses in this way than by raising railroad rates. The taxpayer as a rule,

						<head rend="center sc">NO ADVANTAGE IN GOVERNMENT OPERATION</head>
						<p>As for the advantages which are supposed to be possible under Government ownership
							and operation, they are either illusory, or are to be obtained through Government
							supervision and control of the railroad business in private hands. Tribunals, which
							exercise the power of rate regulation, have already been in existence long enough to
							show that this work can be effectively and properly done. It is to be hoped that
							tribunals for industrial adjustments, in case of disputes over wages or other labor
							conditions, may be established and have equal success. One thing is certain, and that
							is that the claim that Government operation would of itself avoid the danger of
							railroad strikes, is untrue. Strikes of Government employees in Europe and America
							have recently shown that such a hope is illusory. It is not likely that the American
							people will soon forget the strike of the Boston police force, in September, 1919,
							when they left the city at the mercy of a pillaging mob.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP IS PATH TO SOCIALISM</head>
						<p>While the argument of expediency is, in our judgment, very strongly against
							Government ownership <pb id="VAC1119-158" n="158"/> and operation of railroads, the
							matter has a more sinister aspect. This demand originated with the Socialists,
							although many who are not Socialists have been attracted by its illusory advantages.
							The persistent placing of nationalization of railways, mines and all other forms of
							industry, at the head of all Socialist programs from that of Lenine to that of Sidney
							Webb and John Spargo, ought to awaken thoughtful men. It is only too plain that
							Socialists regard the nationalization of railways as a step toward the nationalization
							of all forms of property. Once nationalized, the railroads can not be operated for
							profit, since that would be merely capitalism, in the hands of the State, instead of
							private persons. The employees of railroads would doubtless find working for the
							Government a soft job, as is the case with other Government employees. They would find
							discipline lax, hours perhaps shorter, pay probably greater, temporarily, and the
							demand for efficiency much less intense and persistent than in private industry. They
							would, therefore, speedily join hands with workers in industries not yet
							nationalized, to extend Government ownership and operation, until, as far as we can
							see, Socialism would, at no distant day, have triumphed over individualism. The
							present social order would have been overthrown.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-159" n="159"/>

						<p>That this is no idle dream, but a definite part of the program of the highest class
							of Socialists, is not left to conjecture. These men and women hate violence and
							confiscation, so they say, as much as they hate Lenine and his rule by murder and by
							robbery. They want only a peaceful revolution, by votes, and not by violence, slowly
							and not by catastrophe. Unlike Lenine, they have founded their ideal state upon a
							democratic basis, in which the rule of the majority, expressed at the ballot box, is
							to prevail. Yet they aim at as complete a social transformation as Lenine himself has
							achieved in Russia.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DANGER OF GRADUAL NATIONALIZATION</head>
						<p>That the gradual nationalization of all forms of industry and property, commencing
							with railroads, is a definite expectation of scientific Socialists is proved
							abundantly from their writings. We need only cite Edward Bellamy's book, Equality. In
							that book he describes the process by which the complete socialization of industry was
							achieved. It is precisely what we have sketched here. At first one industry, the
							railroads, was taken over. Next, the same result was achieved, through the force of
							example, and the combination of railroad workers with those in other industries,
							until, a step at a time, the whole State was socialized. Individual freedom, <pb
								id="VAC1119-160" n="160"/> enterprise and invention, the direction of his own life
							by every citizen, the economic spur of interest, the spiritual energy from free
							personal ambition, in youth, manhood and old age, must all have disappeared from
							Bellamy's Utopia. But this point he omits to mention. He dreams only of ideal people
							and affairs, and he does not correct his dream by the careful study of human nature,
							human life and human history.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GOVERNMENT TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONES</head>
						<p>Another demand for the nationalization of industry, which is closely associated with
							the railroad question, and has in fact preceded it in the public mind, is the taking
							over by the Government of telegraphs and telephones. It is not necessary to argue this
							at length. We know that the telephone and telegraph were invented, established and
							perfected in this country, by Americans, and that all this was achieved under the
							individualist system of society. We know that in Europe some States, unlike America,
							kept or took control of telegraphs and telephones. We know that State control of these
							means of communication has resulted in a degree of efficiency far inferior to that
							which we have in American cities, as well as outside of them. All of the arguments
							touching railroad operation apply to the telegraph and telephone systems. But <pb
								id="VAC1119-161" n="161"/> there is one other argument against State ownership and
							control of these means of communication. It is unquestionably the fact that the
							Government would, under such circumstances, be able to exercise a censorship over
							private communications between citizens, as well as in matters of public interest.
							The temptation of the administration to suppress unfavorable news, which would bring
							discredit upon persons in power, would be very influential. The very news which
							reached the people, at times of crises, when they needed to know the whole truth in
							order to vote wisely, might be suppressed by Government gag. A few years ago, there
							would have been some reasonable ground for saying that this would be a fantastic and
							unreasonable fear. Now, however, we know by the Government censorship of cables from
							Paris during the Peace Conference, that the Government is entirely able to suppress
							important information of a public nature through its control of the wires.</p>
						<p>The general conclusion which we draw is that Government control of industry means the
							transfer of power from our people to the Government. It means that, after our
							forefathers fought and died to overthrow the older forms of Governmental despotism, we
							would by nationalization of industry, erect, above ourselves, a new despotism more
							deadly, more powerful, more intense, than the old.</p>

					<p>The phrase, "Social Justice," is sometimes used with the implication that there now
						exists wide-spread social injustice. In this sense, it is claimed by agitators that
						labor is oppressed by capital, that a few at the top of society embezzle the wealth
						produced by the labor of the multitude. No such claim can be supported by the facts,
						since it is untrue. Nevertheless, it is true that the present organization of society is
						not perfect. The mind of man has been applied to the problem of social relations and of
						the production and distribution of wealth, from the earliest times. Progress has been
						made, improvement has been achieved, sometimes very rapidly, sometimes slowly, but most
						rapidly of all in the last hundred years. In that time the laborer's standard of living
						and his real wages have risen, as at no previous time in the history of the world.</p>
					<p>Much remains to be done, and always will remain. The progressive development of human
						reason and of the science of economics will, no doubt, forever work for the improvement
						of humankind. It is in this sense that we use the term, <pb id="VAC1119-163" n="163"/>
						"Social Justice," as a proper aim for every man and woman.</p>
					<p>From time to' time, many proposals are made, many experiments attempted, which are
						expected to help in the adjustment of the relations between men. Many of these prove to
						be only illusory. 'Many do positive harm. Some do a little to improve the world. A very
						few proposals prove to be of great benefit. We shall mention briefly some of the reforms
						which have been urged in recent years.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">COOPERATION</head>
						<p>In England and elsewhere cooperative stores have long been in existence, having for
							their aim the reduction of prices to the consumer. The plan was very simple. Capital
							was supplied at a fixed rate, say five per cent. Members of the society, buying at the
							cooperative store, would pay the usual retail prices. At the end of the month the
							profits would be divided among the purchasers, in the form of a percentage on what
							they had bought. The plan seems very attractive, and, in fact, has succeeded. Not only
							many hundreds of retail stores have been established, but wholesale buying undertaken
							and production attempted. The plan has not taken root in America to any extent,
							although the high prices following the World War <pb id="VAC1119-164" n="164"/> have
							encouraged certain labor unions to attempt it. There is no political or economic
							objection to cooperation, either in the form above described or in the cooperative
							sale of farm products, such as California Fruit Growers have attempted. The
							elimination of unnecessary expense between the producer and the consumer seems to be
							within the reach of economic science, and should be persistently studied and
							attempted.</p>
						<p>Unhappily, cooperative stores in Great Britain are not so successful in solving this
							problem as it was hoped they would be. It was found necessary to put the cooperative
							shops in expensive locations, provide them with show windows and all the apparatus of
							the best department stores, as otherwise they did not secure patrons. The management,
							in order to make a show of success, was tempted to put prices a little above the
							ordinary retail price, in order to make a larger rebate of profits, or dividends, at
							the end of the month to purchasers. Nevertheless, the experiment, if made in America,
							will be watched with interest.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PROFIT SHARING</head>
						<p>The experiment of profit sharing has been attempted in France and England by a
							considerable number of employers, each adopting his own <pb id="VAC1119-165" n="165"/>
							methods. The same thing has taken place in America, and is a hopeful sign of improved
							relations between labor and capital. Indeed, at one time, many persons thought that it
							was the final solution of the problem of labor and capital. Such an expectation has
							not, so far, been realized, and indeed is not likely to be. The fundamental causes of
							friction remain unchanged.</p>
						<p>In the first place, employees may question the percentage of profit which is assigned
							as a bonus to labor, and insist upon a larger share. This does not differ from urging
							higher wages, and might become the basis for strikes. Again, the employees may
							question the honesty of the accounting system, or the competency of the management.
							Employees may feel that mistakes have been made and losses incurred, at least a
							portion of which results in injury to them, and that these mistakes and losses might
							have been avoided, particularly if the employees had been in control.</p>
						<p>Employers, on the other hand, may say that sharing profits is neither just nor
							practicable, unless losses are also shared. In lean years many concerns incur
							deficits. Are employees to help make these good? In prosperous years, a large
							proportion of the profits are set aside to meet possible future losses in well-managed
							concerns, and the full <pb id="VAC1119-166" n="166"/> profits are not distributed. The
							employee has no interest in accumulating a reserve to be enjoyed probably by future
							stockholders, or even by future employees.</p>
						<p>Mr. Schwab advocates profit sharing from the employer's point of view, but he opposes
							a division of the general profits of the business. He urges that the employees should
							receive a share of the profits of the particular unit of work upon which they are
							engaged. This would operate to encourage greater efficiency, on the part of the
							workmen. If the workmen, engaged upon a unit of work which proved to be an
							unprofitable enterprise, should share in the profitable contracts, or units, it would
							be unjust to the workmen on the successful undertaking. They would be discouraged from
							putting forth their highest efforts for the benefit of others. The workmen on the
							unprofitable job would not be stimulated to the same effort, if their reward were to
							come out of the general profits, instead of depending upon the commercial result of
							their own particular undertaking.</p>
						<p>A similar view is taken in the <hi rend="i">Report of Industrial Conference Called by
								the President</hi>, dated March 6, 1920, in which this system is called "gain
							sharing." On page thirty-nine occurs the following language: "Under such plans the
							employees <pb id="VAC1119-167" n="167"/> can see clearly the immediate relation
							between their own efforts and the resulting return. There enter no complicating
							factors of gains and losses made in the purchasing and selling departments for which
							the productive shop employees are in no way responsible. And here also the
							distribution to employees can be made at such frequent intervals as to bring effort
							and return into more immediate relation."</p>
						<p>Profit and gain sharing are matters of business judgment, not susceptible to
							regulation by law. Such experiments give hope of improved relations between labor and
							capital. Some trade-union leaders view profit sharing with disfavor as weakening the
							union, and tying workmen more rigidly to their jobs.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND SHOP COMMITTEES</head>
						<p>In those business undertakings in which profit sharing has been most successful, it
							is not unusual to find that provision has been made which gives the workmen a voice in
							the management of the business. This has often been found most helpful, both to
							employer and employee. They not only come to understand each other's difficulties and
							hardships better, but starting with this new sympathy between master and man, a spirit
							of helpful cooperation develops. This does not amount to <pb id="VAC1119-168" n="168"
							/> what is called by some labor agitators "the democratic control of industry." Such
							control would involve the loss of direction by superior intelligence, and the
							management of affairs by the average judgment of employees, many of them quite
							unfitted for such responsibility. The control, in the last analysis, remains with the
							owner. It may happen, it has happened, that employees finally become the owners. In
							such case, it is believed their control would not be democratic, that is "one man, one
							vote," but in proportion to the amount of stock held by each employee.</p>
						<p>The principle of collective bargaining in general is strongly approved, in the <hi
								rend="i">Report of Industrial Conference</hi>, above referred to, pages thirty to
							thirty-two. This approval extends equally to the type of bargaining in which employees
							act through the trade union, and to that type in which they act through some other
							plan of employee representation, provided the representative of the men is chosen by a
							majority. The <hi rend="i">Industrial Conference Report</hi> proposes to leave the
							enforcement of collective bargaining, at least for the present, to good faith
							alone.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">MINIMUM WAGE</head>
						<p>A proposed reform, which, unlike cooperation and profit sharing, does involve the
							enactment of law <pb id="VAC1119-169" n="169"/> and the formation of a judgment by
							voters, is the minimum wage. There has been wide-spread complaint against the low
							wages paid to certain classes of labor, as, for instance, to the most poorly paid
							class of department store employees. It was urged that girls, so employed upon wages
							insufficient to provide them with the necessaries of life, were led, through economic
							necessity, to sacrifice their virtue in the attempt to gain further income. There was
							much in this appeal to stir the emotions, but no better illustration can be given of
							the necessity for critical examination of the facts before making a decision.</p>
						<p>In the first place, it was pretty well established, by careful research, that the
							question of virtue depended upon considerations of training, environment and personal
							qualities, rather than upon wages. The poorest paid girls are by no means worse, upon
							the average, than those more highly paid. But a more conclusive argument is, that
							those whose labor is not worth the minimum wage, prescribed by law, will not be
							employed at all.</p>
						<p>What is to become of them? Are they not entitled to earn what they can? Is society to
							lose the benefit of such labor as they can perform? Are they to be made to lose the
							self-respect which comes with effort, and forced to become objects of charity, <pb
								id="VAC1119-170" n="170"/> in our anxiety to see that greedy employers pay decent
							wages? Would it not be far better and more effective, in the case of an employer who
							underpays his employees, to make the facts public, and turn trade from his
							establishment until he corrects his unfair practises? The American people are prone to
							cry out for the law to remedy Social Injustice, when a quicker way to reach it is to
							be found in their own action. It is an evil thing to be always looking to the State to
							do what the people can do for themselves.</p>
						<p><hi rend="i">The Industrial Conference</hi>, in its report March 6, 1920, insists on
							such wages as insure reasonable living conditions, and protect the community and
							individual from the ill effect of lack of competence. It does not give any sanction to
							a minimum wage fixed by law, such as has been discussed above, under this title.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PENSIONS</head>
						<p>Another method, by which some reformers think that Social Injustice can be
							alleviated, is by having the Government grant pensions in large numbers, and on
							various grounds. We are all familiar with the pension for wounded, disabled, or aged
							soldiers. The industrial pension is of quite a different nature. It is also quite
							different from pensions for retiring <pb id="VAC1119-171" n="171"/> teachers,
							policemen and firemen. All these cases rest upon the theory that the pension is
							deferred pay.</p>
						<p>One form of pension, or industrial insurance, which has been tried in Germany and
							Great Britain, and on a smaller scale in France, is a pension for very old persons,
							particularly for those whose income is below a certain very modest figure. This
							proposal has the merit that old age can not be feigned, if birth records have been
							carefully kept. It seems plain that such a plan is open to the objection that it
							discourages saving during the years when the earning power is unimpaired. Men would be
							encouraged rather to look to the State for support in their old age than to their own
							industry and thrift. Deliberately to encourage such state of mind is to undermine the
							morale of workers. This objection is partly met if it be required that the pensioner
							himself contribute throughout his life, or for a period of years, to the pension fund,
							and that the pension be proportioned to these savings. The whole arrangement seems
							much inferior to a system under which just wages are paid, and frugality made the
							basis of provision for old age.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</head>
						<p>Another kind of pension, which existed in Germany even before the war, is an
							allowance for unemployment <pb id="VAC1119-172" n="172"/> or disability. Students of
							the German system criticized it very freely. They declared that it was teaching the
							German people to feign sickness in order to draw sick benefits. One writer stated that
							they took regular instruction in feigning symptoms, so as to pass the tests. All this
							is most demoralizing, tending to break down individual character, instead of
							stiffening it by self-reliance.</p>
						<p>Other pensions have been proposed, but have not found many advocates. Such proposals
							assume that other persons, who have worked and saved, who have used their strength and
							intelligence to the best of their ability to perform their share of the world's work
							and to provide for themselves and their dependents, ought to contribute to the support
							of those who are not merely unfortunate, but those who have failed in industry and
							frugality. Such a proposition seems to have less justice than injustice in it. To tax
							efficiency and self-denial for the benefit not merely of the unfortunate but for the
							benefit of the self-indulgent and inefficient, is repugnant to common justice.</p>
						<p>These considerations do not deny the fact that there are many unfortunates who are
							entitled to be helped. It is believed that all of these can be generously cared for
							under provisions for orphans, the infirm, the aged, the sick, the widow with small
							children <pb id="VAC1119-173" n="173"/> for whom she can not properly provide. This
							duty is not shirked, either by private or public philanthropy. Certain it is that
							nothing is easier than to demand State pensions, grants, bonuses, or the like, and
							nothing more demoralizing to our people and the whole community than to let such a
							habit get fastened upon us. It should be discouraged and opposed, except where the
							most careful consideration of the whole subject shows that there is no other way to
							provide for the deserving.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WAGES IN GENERAL</head>
						<p>Socialists, and some labor leaders who are not Socialists, describe the wage system
							now existing as "wage slavery." The words contain a false implication, and have served
							many an agitator in making revolutionary appeals to excited audiences. Human slavery
							involved the ownership of human beings, by other human beings. Slaves were bought and
							sold like horses. What the slave produced belonged to his owner. What he got was food,
							clothing and shelter. He had no right to change his owner, his work or his home. He
							had no voice in Government and no standing in court, any more than an ox. Can any
							person with an honest mind declare that the term "wage slavery" is a just description
							of the present system?</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-174" n="174"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WAGES AND NATURAL LAW</head>
						<p>The first influence which affects wages is the natural law of supply and demand.
							Society demands a certain kind of service, in certain quantities, as for instance, the
							raising of wheat or making of shoes. When the number of persons in these industries is
							not large enough to meet the public demand for shoes and wheat, the public must pay
							more in order to raise the earning power of men in such work and thereby attract more
							men to that occupation. On the other hand, if too many men raise wheat or become
							shoe-makers, an over-supply will result in lower prices. The earning power of labor in
							that kind of work will tend to fall; and men will leave the farm and the shoe factory
							for other jobs where there is a scarcity of labor and wages are higher. Since some
							occupations are more agreeable, and some less; since some branches of industry require
							great natural skill, or prolonged training, while others require little skill and
							little training, it is but natural that wages should be higher in those lines which
							are unattractive or where the requisite skill or training is hard to get, and lower in
							those branches of industry which are over-supplied with labor.</p>
						<p>There is yet another factor in the fixation of wages, under natural law. Capital, or
							saved wealth, wealth produced by former generations but not consumed by them, is
							necessary in many forms of industry. <pb id="VAC1119-175" n="175"/> The cobbler
							requires only a bench and a few tools, but the modern shoe factory, by which shoes are
							produced in abundance with a minimum of labor, requires a great investment. Capital,
							like labor, tends to move freely under the law of demand and supply. Where profits in
							an industry are large, as, let us suppose, in the making of shoes, capital tends to
							flow into that industry, thereby stimulating a demand for labor. Wherever profits are
							small or uncertain, capital is anxious to withdraw from such business, and, no matter
							how much the business requires more capital, it may be difficult or impossible to
							obtain. A perfect illustration of this is our American railroads, which for some years
							before the World War had become to a large extent unprofitable enterprises. Government
							had kept the rates so low and labor had forced operating expenses to so high a point
							that investors refused to put money into the railroad business. As a result our
							country was seriously hampered when the war broke out by lack of engines, cars,
							switches, yards, stations, double track and the like. This condition has not been
							remedied. The country has grown, but railroads have not grown with it.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OBSTRUCTIONS TO SUPPLY AND DEMAND</head>
						<p>The free movements of labor and capital, under the law of supply and demand, do not
							always take <pb id="VAC1119-176" n="176"/> place. Labor does not, in practise, move
							freely from one trade to another. For this there are many reasons. A laborer knows
							only his own trade, and may be unwilling or unable to master another. He may prefer to
							live in the locality where he has his home and friends. A laborer may be prevented
							from entering a trade, which is short of men, by the regulations of a trade union. He
							may be out of work and yet not know that there are places where labor is needed.</p>
						<p>So with capital. One business may be oversupplied with capital, that is, there may be
							too many shoe factories, too many machines, so that a part are idle. But the capital
							is locked up in those empty buildings and those idle machines. It can not be withdrawn
							to supply the farmer with labor-saving machines, for raising and gathering his
							crops.</p>
						<p>If it were not for these and other obstructions, or limitations, which interfere with
							the full operation of the law of supply and demand, it is conceivable that wage
							adjustments would take place naturally and easily, without struggle and without
							conflict.</p>
						<p>Trade-union leaders particularly deny that the price of labor should be regulated by
							supply and demand. They claim that this treats labor as a mere commodity, like wheat
							or cattle. They say that the human element, the welfare of the laborer himself, <pb
								id="VAC1119-177" n="177"/> must be taken into consideration. In this they are right.
							The welfare of the laborer must be taken into consideration, but economic law itself
							to some extent protects the welfare of the laborer.</p>
						<p>If wages, hours of work or conditions of living be such as to impair the health, the
							vigor and the efficiency of the laborer, it is inevitable that the best results in
							production will not be attained. Workmen would rapidly 'deteriorate, thus reducing
							their output, and increasing the demand for labor, which in turn could only be
							supplied by improvements in wages, hours, or living conditions. It is true that these
							natural laws, left to themselves, appear to work slowly and with cruelty. Hence the
							labor leader is right when he says the human element must be considered. Employers who
							are intelligent, just and far-sighted do not wait to learn the result of the
							underpayment of labor. They anticipate it and provide against it by reasonable, just
							and humane provisions.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OTHER NATURAL LAWS AFFECTING WAGES</head>
						<p>If wages can not in the long run be depressed below the standard fixed by supply and
							demand, neither can they in the long run be raised above the level fixed by natural
							law. Let us suppose that the employees on American railroads succeed, either by <pb
								id="VAC1119-178" n="178"/> a strike or threat of a strike, by arbitration or
							decision of a Government tribunal, or even by an Act of Congress, in lifting their
							wages to a point far beyond the level which would be fixed by the operation of supply
							and demand. Suppose that railroad wages are boosted far above the level of wages for
							similar work, or work presenting the same general features of requisite skill and
							endurance, by reason of the fact that rail employees use the pressure of trade-union
							organization to obstruct the operation of the law of supply and demand. The question
							is, can such an artificial boost be maintained, or will natural law in the end have
							its way? The answer is, of course, that natural law will prevail, as will now be
							shown.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FARM INDUSTRY AS RELATED TO WAGES</head>
						<p>It has been pointed out that prosperity involves an abundant supply of necessaries,
							including farm products, at moderate prices. This depends upon abundant production by
							the farmer, and such a result, in turn, can not be had unless a sufficient number of
							men engage in farming, either as owners or laborers, or both. Furthermore, the farmer
							needs to be supplied with improved labor-saving machinery if he is to reach a maximum
							output.</p>
						<p>But every one of these elements is, in turn, dependent <pb id="VAC1119-179" n="179"/>
							upon the existence of another factor, the factor of probable profit. The prospect of
							profit does not exist if farm wages are too high, if farm machinery can not be had,
							either from high interest or high prices, or if railroad rates for carrying farm
							products exact too large a part of the farmer's income. High railroad wages mean high
							rates for transporting farm products to market and encourage high wages in other
							industries; thus tending to raise the wages of farm labor, by reducing the labor
							supply on the farm. These things reduce the reward which should urge the farmer to his
							highest exertion and maximum risk.</p>
						<p>We have pointed out elsewhere that we can not have abundance of farm products without
							the produce of poor farms and medium farms, as well as of farms of the highest grade.
							Artificially high wages, like unnecessarily high taxes, will inevitably cause the

							finds that his higher pay buys less than he could formerly get with his old wage. The

						<head rend="center sc">IMMIGRATION, THE BIRTH RATE AND WAGES</head>
						<p>Other illustrations of the control of wages by natural law are to be found in the
							results of immigration and emigration, and in the rise and fall of the birth rate.
							High wages in America, far above the general world level, tend to attract foreign
							laborers in great numbers. At first sight, this would seem to have a tendency to lower
							American wages, but this has not always been so. In fact, the most usual and obvious
							result of immigration has been that the immigrant takes over the unskilled work, while
							native Americans, and earlier immigrants, are moved up to the higher levels of labor.
							Thus, Irish and Germans have advanced in the social scale, their places having been
							filled by Italians, Russians and Hungarians. The market for skilled labor is enlarged
							or restricted by the increase or decrease in the supply of necessary unskilled
							labor.</p>
						<p>High wages also tend to encourage early marriages and the rearing of large families,
							and thus indirectly accomplish their own destruction. On the other hand, low wages
							make for late marriages and small families, thus decreasing the labor supply, and in
							the end bringing about higher wages.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">WAGE CONTESTS</head>
						<p>If these principles were generally understood, contests over wages, strikes,
							lockouts, the interruption <pb id="VAC1119-181" n="181"/> of industry, bitterness,
							class antagonism, would seem worse than foolish. No policy, which is selfish to the
							extent that it is anti-social, or opposed to the general interests of the rest of the
							people, can, in the long run, win out. It may for a time have temporary success,
							though involving great loss, but finally natural justice will assert itself.</p>
						<p>Natural justice, however, often moves slowly. There are temporary obstructions to the
							operation of natural economic law. Hence, it becomes advisable and necessary to
							provide tribunals of the highest standard for the investigation and decision of wage
							disputes. Such tribunals should take into consideration the whole problem, the bearing
							of the dispute on general industry, particularly upon the farmer and his
							prosperity.</p>
						<p>When all these elements have been considered by just and wise men sitting as members
							of a wage tribunal, they will reach a result which conforms in general to natural
							economic law. They will make sure that their decision gives the workmen all to which
							they are entitled under that law, without lessening that degree of well-being, which
							is equally the just right of men in every other branch of industry. It is the office
							of the wage tribunal to remove the obstructions and hardships involved in the slow
							grinding processes of natural law. This is all <pb id="VAC1119-182" n="182"/> they can
							do. If the decision of a wage tribunal is artificial and anti-social, it will in time,
							though with great hardships to the people, be destroyed by natural economic

						<head rend="center sc">HOURS OF LABOR</head>
						<p>No demand of labor has been more persistent and aggressive, than the demand for a
							shorter working day. The ten-hour day has been reduced to nine, and even to eight
							hours. The forty-eight hour week has been reduced to forty-four hours. Still the
							demand for shorter hours goes on. Miners ask for the six-hour day. Edward Bellamy, in
							his <hi rend="i">Equality</hi>, thought a four-hour day was long enough for labor. In
							Moscow, under Lenine, clerks in stores, left to fix their own hours of labor, even in
							drug stores and food supply stores, have generally fixed the day to begin at ten <hi
								rend="sc">A. M.</hi> and to close at three or four <hi rend="sc">P. M.</hi> The rest
							of the time places of business are closed.<ref id="ref_026" rend="super"
								target="note_026">*</ref></p>
						<p>What is the limit to this sort of thing? Reduction of working hours, as every one can
							see, may go too far. Labor leaders claim that this is to be settled by humane
							considerations. So it must, but only so far as humane considerations coincide in
							substance with the inevitable regulation of natural law. The point at which hours of
							labor are determined, <note id="note_026"><ref target="ref_026" rend="super"
									>*</ref><hi rend="i">Literary Digest</hi>. Feb. 7, 1920.</note>
							<pb id="VAC1119-183" n="183"/> under natural law, is the point of maximum efficiency
							and production. Anything less is wasteful and anti-social, and so is anything more.
							But the question is not merely whether a man can produce as much in one working day of
							eight hours as in one working 'day of nine hours. The real question is also one of the
							number of working years that the man can remain in industry, and productive. It may
							well be that an eight-hour day will enable a man to live and work a great deal longer
							than if he worked nine or ten hours a day. Natural law is humane. In the long run it
							is impossible to have a better guide.</p>
						<p>But the problem of the working day in a particular industry can not be considered and
							decided properly if it be separated from a consideration of hours of labor in other
							forms of industry. It may as well be accepted, first as last, that the farmer will not
							see the city dweller reduce working hours by artificial pressure, without reprisal. If
							a factory hand works fewer hours than are sufficient for his maximum output, somebody
							must make good the waste of time, the loss of product, from which society suffers. The
							somebody who makes good will be the rest of the people in general, and the farmer in
							particular. No adjustment of hours of labor should fail to recognize that the farmer's
							working day is a <pb id="VAC1119-184" n="184"/> long day, under requirements of his
							occupation. Long before sunrise the farmer must be feeding his horses and milking his
							cows. Long after dark he must wade through the mud or' stumble over the frozen ground
							of the feed lot, as he looks after his sheep and cattle.</p>
						<p>It is useless to expect the farmer to work long hours in the heat of harvest-time or
							in the cold of winter, while his city brother begins work at eight o'clock in the
							morning and quits at four, with a Saturday half-holiday, unless the farmer and his
							laborers are paid for their extra labor. The people who pay for those extra hours of
							work on the farm, will be the rest of the community in general, and' in the long run,
							include the very men who have the shortest working day. It will be taken out of them
							through increased prices of farm products.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF PRICES</head>
						<p>The control of prices by Government has long been a favorite instrument for the
							prevention of Social Injustice. In former times, particularly when war or famine had
							brought about scarcity and want, Governments attempted to fix the prices of such
							articles as bread, sugar, meat and other necessaries, and punish violators of such
							laws with great severity. As a rule such laws did but little good, <pb
								id="VAC1119-185" n="185"/> and often did great harm. In the first place they were
							easily evaded. The rich found methods for obtaining illicit supplies, while the poor
							continued to wait, cold and hungry, in long lines for many hours at the baker's, the
							butcher's, the grocer's, or the coal dealer's place of business. Only too often they
							would arrive after a dreary wait to find the supplies exhausted. But a result of
							price-fixing, which was even worse, was often a decline in production. If the price of
							wheat and flour and bread are put low enough to bring them within reach of the people,
							such supplies may not be produced in the old quantities, or may not be imported from
							other countries, on so large a scale. Thus price-fixing, as a general rule, tends to
							defeat itself. Government interference tends to hurt business, to do more harm than
							good, and is, on the whole, unintelligent, as compared with the intelligence which
							business men trained by experience use in the conduct of their own affairs.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the opposition of orthodox economic students to
							price-fixing by Government, experience has shown that there is a limited area where it
							is necessary. A monopoly of some particular service or supply has often been regulated
							by Government price-fixing to the advantage of the public. Railroads and all other
							public utilities belong <pb id="VAC1119-186" n="186"/> to this class. The people are
							dependent upon them, and can not go elsewhere to be served. Bungling as are often the
							decisions of rate commissions, they are better than none. It is essential to improve
							the character of such tribunals, and to work out systems of rate regulation which are
							fair alike to the business and to the public.</p>
						<p>It is just possible that this method of price-fixing may be extended to other
							businesses. Since 1890 it has been the American policy under the Sherman Anti-Trust
							Law to prohibit and punish the formation of trusts or industrial monopolies. Under
							this law many of the larger and more dangerous combinations, such as the Tobacco
							Trust, the Standard Oil Trust and others, have been broken up. The results have not
							been altogether bad, but they have been disappointing. It may be that this policy of
							prohibition will be abandoned, and that monopolies will be regulated by Government
							fixation of prices.</p>
						<p>During the World War, the most successful attempt to control the prices of a few
							necessaries which has ever been made took place. The farmer received a guarantee of a
							good price for his wheat, in order to encourage production. The miller was required to
							operate under a Government license, which restricted his prices and his purchases.
							This system was extended to the jobber and the retailer. <pb id="VAC1119-187" n="187"
							/> Finally the individual consumer was rationed, that is, he was allowed to buy only
							so much of the regulated article, in a certain length of time, for each member of his
							household. By thus controlling the article at every stage of progress, from original
							production to ultimate consumption, it may be said that the cause of Social Justice
							was effectively supported.</p>
						<p>It should be clearly understood that Government price-fixing, though sometimes
							necessary, is always open to objections. The system offers great temptations, if not
							opportunities, for corruption of Government officials. The raising or lowering of the
							price of some necessary of life, by even a slight amount, often involves incalculable
							sums of money, which are to be made or lost by interested dealers. We should never
							sanction Government price-fixing except where there is no other way left to protect
							the people from monopoly rates and scarcity prices. Government regulation of rates and
							prices is like fire, a wonderful servant, but once out of control, it becomes a cruel
							and terrible master.</p>

					<p>We can not too often recall to our minds the primitive poverty and privation which
						characterized the lives of our pioneer forefathers, and the contrast between those times
						and the present. The moment we fix our attention upon the occupants of the log cabin
						which belonged to the early days of every American community, we see that their lives,
						though hard, were self-sufficient and self-reliant. Food and clothing, in fact nearly
						all necessaries, were produced by the family through unremitting effort. Indeed they had
						but little opportunity to travel, or to obtain supplies from other places. If near a
						river, there might be a flat-boat for downstream transportation. On land, horseback
						trips were the only means of journeying, until primitive roads afforded passage for
						rough wheeled vehicles. In contrast with all this, we perceive that, in our time, life
						is characterized by dependence, Land by freedom of movement. The city dweller obtains
						his supplies from all parts of the continent, nay from all parts of the world. Cotton
						comes from the South; wheat from the West; beef, coffee and pepper from South America;
						sugar from Cuba; tea from China, <pb id="VAC1119-189" n="189"/> and so on through the
						whole list, and this is true of every laborer's family, much the same as of the
						well-to-do. The farmer too, in his turn, is dependent on remote sources for supplies of
						implements, fertilizers, clothing, hardware and many other articles.</p>
					<p>How did all this come about? It came through the invention of the steam and gas
						engines, and their use in transportation. It came through the invention of labor-saving
						machinery, which required the concentration of great supplies of labor, in cities, where
						factories were located.</p>
					<p>Side by side with the advance of the mechanical arts in the nineteenth century went the
						growth of business organization. The new enterprises, so different from the old both in
						character and size, it was soon evident could not be carried on nor developed by
						individuals working alone like the pioneer working on his clearing in the forest. The
						individual had not the capital, nor the capacity, for such giant undertakings. There
						must be financial institutions, such as savings banks, to collect the savings of all the
						people, and invest them in these new enterprises, so that they might have the necessary
						capital. There were required corporations, by which the capital and the labor of
						multitudes of men might be concentrated under unified control, in order successfully to
						establish and conduct the enterprises which modern invention had made possible.</p>


					<pb id="VAC1119-190" n="190"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CORPORATIONS</head>
						<p>A corporation is an artificial person, created by law, which enables many individuals
							to combine and act as one man, with a limited liability for each shareholder, and with
							control vested in a small board of directors. It possesses the advantage of limited
							liability for debts incurred, thus encouraging investment in new enterprises, shares
							are transferable, and the enterprise is not dissolved by the death of members of the
							corporation. The corporation was not looked on with favor by the English law of
							earlier days, and there is no natural right to form a corporation, at common law.
							There must be authority obtained from the legislature or from Congress before a
							corporation can be organized, so that, from first to last, corporations are to be
							regarded as intended to promote the general welfare, even more than private advantage.
							Any corporation which fails to promote the general welfare of the community from which
							its authority is derived, fails to do that which was the purpose of its creation by
							the Government.</p>
						<p>So rapid has been the growth of corporations, such vast amounts of capital have been
							concentrated under the control of a few men, that we have been disposed to fear their
							excessive power. Yet, no one <pb id="VAC1119-191" n="191"/> can observe the work which
							private corporations have performed in America without realizing that no such progress
							as we have made has ever before taken place in this world in the same length of time,
							nor could such progress have been achieved by private individuals without the
							corporate form of organization.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SUPERVISION OF CORPORATIONS</head>
						<p>A properly conducted corporation is therefore not to be feared, much less hated, but,
							rightly viewed, it is seen to be one of the foremost agents of American progress.
							Unhappily, while corporations are thus capable of uses which benefit every man, woman
							and child in the community, increasing the supply of enjoyable comforts in every home,
							adding to the variety and interest of every life, nevertheless corporations have also
							their grave abuses. It becomes necessary for supervision and control of corporate
							activities to be undertaken by the Government and continually improved and made more
							efficient. It is not sufficient for the State to charter a corporation and then leave
							it to wander over the high seas of commerce, like a pirate of old. On the contrary it
							must be watched, supervised, regulated and controlled by the State, just in proportion
							as its capacity for abuses grows. It is not unnatural <pb id="VAC1119-192" n="192"/>
							that America created corporations more rapidly than she developed systems for their
							supervision and control. The task of developing our country was so urgent and so vast,
							our people were so impatient for new railroads and factories, banks and stores, that
							they clamored for legislatures and Congress to hurry with the grant of franchises in
							order that the development of American business might be rushed. No just person need
							wonder that railroads were built and allowed to grow to vast proportions before it was
							seen that they needed stringent regulation and Governmental control. No one need
							wonder that vast commercial combinations, such as we are accustomed to call by the
							name of "trusts," sprang into being, secured capital in quantities hardly dreamed of
							before, and, entering regions with scarcely an inhabitant, in a few years built great
							manufacturing cities with all the appliances of modern city life, nor that the
							enormous power which they thus secured over the lives of men was left, at first,
							unregulated, unsupervised, uncontrolled. That such power was open to abuse and was
							abused, in many instances, is too plain for argument.</p>
						<p>It is not within our scope to discuss the details of corporate supervision by
							Government. In fact, it is a comparatively new branch of Government. It requires
							experts of the highest ability to work out <pb id="VAC1119-193" n="193"/> scientific
							supervision of corporations, so that they may benefit the community as they were
							designed to do without being led into abuses, as they have at times been. Many laws of
							great value have already found their way to our statute books on this subject. We need
							only mention the Interstate Commerce Law, designed to regulate railroad rates and
							prevent discrimination, the Federal Reserve Law, for the better supervision and
							regulation of banks, laws to prevent child labor, and laws to secure sanitary
							practises in packing houses. None of these laws is perfect. In fact, the whole field
							of legislation is new. It requires time, thought, experience, patience and skill of
							the highest order to perfect them. It is enough to point out that this great work is
							now recognized as one of the important branches of Government, just as, long ago, it
							was recognized that the organization of courts of justice, juries, and the whole
							apparatus of civil and criminal law formed one of the great and difficult tasks of
							Government.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PREJUDICE AGAINST CORPORATIONS</head>
						<p>To sum up what ought to be the voter's attitude of mind toward the corporation
							problem, we think he should divest himself of prejudice against the corporation, as
							such, and direct his attention toward its abuses. He should realize that corporate
							regulation <pb id="VAC1119-194" n="194"/> is an expert and technical field for
							legislation, as yet comparatively new, which demands all the intelligence, honesty and
							patriotism of which the American people are capable. The control and regulation of
							corporations must not be such as to cripple them. They must be made attractive to
							investors, since the community will itself suffer, if capital be driven or frightened
							away from useful and necessary corporate investments. Yet they must not be permitted
							to exercise monopoly powers to the injury of the farmer, the cattle raiser, or other
							producers of raw materials of which great corporations may become almost the only
							purchasers. They must feel the strong hand of Government extended in friendly sympathy
							for their protection and encouragement, so long as they do good to the community and
							general public, but quick to punish injustice, fraud and oppression. At every step the
							corporation must feel that the power of Government is above it and superior to it.
							Corporations must never be permitted to control our Government. Government must always
							effectively control corporations.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">LABOR ORGANIZATIONS</head>
						<p>The organization of capital, by which its control was consolidated in corporations,
							was accompanied by the organization of labor into bodies of <pb id="VAC1119-195"
								n="195"/> workmen, formed for the protection of their interests and assertion of
							their rights. The labor organization was not only natural, even inevitable, but it was
							in a very high degree beneficial to working men, and through them to the general
							public. No survey of labor legislation, and of the improvement in the wages, hours and
							general conditions of labor, which has taken place in America since the Civil War, can
							fail to recognize the advantages and benefits of trade unions.</p>
						<p>The trade union has, however, a marked difference from the corporation, because it
							has grown up by the voluntary association of workers with one another. The trade
							union, as a rule, is not incorporated, not governed by any statute, pursuant to which
							it has been formed. Nevertheless, these extra-legal organizations have grown to
							gigantic proportions in many industries. They have, in important instances, managed to
							get all or nearly all workers, in particular classes of labor, to join the union.
							These organizations have a membership extending from ocean to ocean. With this large
							membership they have managed to secure a high degree of discipline, and a singular
							submission of the rank and file to the policy and orders of the leaders.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-196" n="196"/>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">TRADE UNIONS VERSUS I. W. W.</head>
						<p>The trade union has been organized distinctly as a trade body, and not as an
							organization of all workers of every kind employed in any branch of industry. Thus,
							railroad men are organized into many unions, of which the leading ones are the
							conductors, the engineers, the firemen and the trainmen. In this respect the
							Industrial Workers of the World, popularly called the I. W. W., have an entirely
							different method of organization. They, reject the idea of unionizing the particular
							craft, and attempt to combine all classes of workers engaged in a branch of industry
							into a single organization, this being in direct opposition to the trade-union idea.
							The I. W. W. method necessarily tends more to the equalization of wages, as by mere
							numbers the unskilled or slightly skilled workers are able to out-vote the small
							number of the highly skilled and, therefore, to deprive the latter of a part, if not
							all, of their advantage as skilled workmen.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ABUSES OF UNIONS</head>
						<p>The fact that the trade union is not an incorporated body is a public disadvantage,
							because the contracts of the union are not enforceable, and the union funds, which
							often amount to many millions of dollars, are not available for judgments of damages,
								<pb id="VAC1119-197" n="197"/> where union contracts are Broken. Some of the
							soundest thinkers of our day favor the incorporation of trade unions under laws framed
							for the purpose. Such a step would give labor leaders better control of their
							organizations, and would probably tend to favor the election of able and conservative
							men to office. One of the chief dangers of trade unions in the past has been the
							growing tendency toward the selection of violent fighting men for leadership. The
							various candidates for office in the unions sometimes outbid one another, or try to do
							so, in the promises they make as to the increase of wages which they will secure if
							elected. This method of electioneering, by promising pecuniary advantage to their
							followers, is extremely dangerous, and contrary to the general welfare of the American
							people. Leaders, bound by such promises, if elected, often find themselves committed
							to make demands which can not be justified, either on economic or moral grounds, and
							can in fact have no hope of success, except through coercive strikes, and even through
							violence.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE EMPLOYERS' SIDE</head>
						<p>When impossible demands, or at least unjustifiable ones, are made by a union, and
							supported by a strike, the employer naturally seeks to protect <pb id="VAC1119-198"
								n="198"/> himself, his business and his property, by engaging other workmen to take
							the places of those on strike. In many instances he would be quite able to do so,
							except for the violent interference with, and intimidation of, new employees by the
							strikers or their sympathizers. Such interference with the employer's rights is
							intolerable from the point of view of law, order and the public welfare. A sound
							public opinion ought never to tolerate violence, threats, or intimidation of workmen
							who desire to take places left vacant by strikers. If the American Government can not
							make good this position, and protect non-union laborers willing to take the place of
							strikers, it can not survive.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE EMPLOYEES' SIDE</head>
						<p>Nevertheless, it must not be supposed that employers can hope to receive the support
							of public opinion, unless their own conduct toward their employees has been just and
							fair. The employer must be able to show that his wages are just, and, by that, we mean
							the highest wages possible to be paid, under the conditions of the particular
							business, and consistent with the profitable and successful conduct of the business.
							Hours of labor must likewise be reasonable; and the conditions of the worker, with
							regard to health, safety, convenience and comfort <pb id="VAC1119-199" n="199"/> ought
							to be the best possible. In such circumstances, where the employer is able to show a
							clean record on his own part, he is entitled to the support of good men and women,
							through their contributions to a favorable public opinion. If the employer falls short
							of these exacting requirements, he will not be supported by the public, and he ought
							not to be.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ARBITRATION OF LABOR DISPUTES</head>
						<p>It may often be true that fair-minded employers and fair-minded union leaders, with
							the best intentions in the world, are unable to agree. Under such circumstances,
							arbitration by disinterested tribunals is the best known method by which just
							settlements may be attained. Public opinion should support demands for arbitration,
							where employer and employee are unable to agree. Even where arbitration has been
							agreed to by both sides, and after full investigation a decision has been rendered by
							the arbitrators, it often happens that the union fails to carry out the terms of the
							agreement. Sometimes the leaders of the union are at fault, but more often the men
							themselves break away from their leaders and get out of hand. It seems plain that the
							whole standard and reputation of the unions would be raised if this evil could be done
							away with by establishing legal methods for the enforcement <pb id="VAC1119-200"
								n="200"/> of awards of arbitrators. Awards thus made, after voluntary submission of
							both sides to the arbitration, are, in effect, contracts between the two parties and
							should be enforceable at law, equally against both sides. Employers indeed are easily
							reached by the law, if at fault, as they sometimes are, but the enforcement of
							contracts and awards against labor unions is a serious problem which requires a just
							and intelligent solution by the American people.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ARBITRATION NOT ALWAYS APPLICABLE </head>
						<p>A more difficult, and as yet unsolved, problem is the question, are all disputes
							between employer and employee such as to be suitable for arbitration, and should sound
							public opinion insist upon arbitration in all such matters? An illustration of this
							problem occurs where an employer has a non-union or open shop, and his men demand the
							right to organize and join the general union of their trade. Trade-union leaders
							insist that this is a fit subject for arbitration, where an agreement can not be
							reached otherwise. Employers take the ground that the recognition of the union is a
							fundamental question to be decided by the employer, and that the question of open or
							closed shop can never be submitted to arbitration. There is much force in this view,
							in respect to businesses of a character which <pb id="VAC1119-201" n="201"/> d1o not
							affect the public interest in any marked degree. It is hard to see why the owner of a
							foundry or a furniture factory should not be entitled to run his business with an open
							shop, if he desires. He can quit business if he wants to, and no way exists by which
							he could be compelled to recognize the union and go on with his business.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, an illustration of an employee's right, which ought not to be
							questioned under any circumstances, and therefore appears to be unsuitable for
							arbitration, is the right of the employees to bargain collectively with their
							employer, and for this purpose to organize in their own shop, and select qualified
							representatives to present their side of the case to the employer. This is indeed very
							different from unionizing the shop, which involves joining the general union of the
							trade and exposing the shop to the invasion of agitators from other places. Employers
							may, now and then, deny the right of collective bargaining by shop organizations, but
							in doing so they are opposing the best thought and most expert judgment of our time
							and our country.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">EMPLOYEES IN PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC BUSINESS</head>
						<p>A broad distinction ought to be made between the relations of labor to ordinary
							private employers, <pb id="VAC1119-202" n="202"/> and those which employees sustain to
							their employers, when the business is that of the Government, or serves to perform an
							important function of Government. It must be evident to every fair-minded person that
							soldiers, in the service of the Government, have not the right to strike. Such an act
							would be insubordination and would be followed by severe punishment. Desertion in the
							presence of the enemy might be followed by death at the hands of a firing squad. This
							results from the essential nature of the employment. Authority is the very essence of
							Government, and the right to resist it would be the right to destroy Government
							itself. So, also, policemen and firemen, when they engage in such important public
							service, ought to be considered as having waived the right to strike.</p>
						<p>This question arose in Boston, in 1919, where the police formed a union and, in
							defiance of the rule of the department, affiliated with the American Federation of
							Labor. Certain members of the force were discharged for violation of this rule,
							whereupon the entire force of police quit. The result was a day and a night in which
							the city of Boston became the prey of its criminal classes. Governor Coolidge saw the
							point involved clearly and defined it, when he said that "the act of the police force
							was not an ordinary labor strike, but a <pb id="VAC1119-203" n="203"/> desertion." His
							firm stand in using troops to maintain order while he organized a new police force to
							replace the deserters, was followed in many places by a prompt surrender by firemen
							and policemen of union charters, which they had obtained.</p>
						<p>It seems equally plain that postal employees ought to be regarded in the same light
							as soldiers, policemen and firemen, for the reason that the public interest and the
							proper performance of Government functions could not endure to have the mail service
							interrupted by a strike.</p>
						<p>These observations involve one other point of great importance, which is, that means
							must be provided by which grievances can be presented and receive fair consideration.
							To fail to make such a provision would be inexcusable. However, the cases of trouble
							with soldiers and sailors of the United States Government have rarely occurred, and
							have never taken the form of strikes, or organized rebellion. Police and firemen have
							only recently shown such a tendency, and postal strikes are unknown in this
							country.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">RAILROAD EMPLOYEES</head>
						<p>Much more serious is the labor question, in the case of railroads. Railroad
							corporations have long been recognized by the courts as having a public or <pb
								id="VAC1119-204" n="204"/> quasi-public character. They are said "to be affected
							with a public interest." In a sense, they perform a function of Government, even
							though operated by private companies. Their duties are prescribed by law, and their
							rates to the public are fixed by the Government. If private capital did not supply
							adequate railroads, the Government would have to go into the railroad business itself.
							The interruption of railroad service, for only a few days, would result in
							incalculable suffering. The health, comfort and even the lives of our people would be
							endangered. It is plain that the interruption of railroad service, by strikes, would
							be intolerable, and the assertion of such a right on the part of railroad employees is
							inconsistent with the authority of Government and the general Welfare of the American
							people.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OTHER PUBLIC UTILITIES</head>
						<p>There are many other public services in which strikes appear to be equally
							inadmissible. City people are dependent on street-cars, electric lighting facilities,
							telephones and water supply to such an extent that their interruption means
							unspeakable hardships and danger to the whole population. Telegraph lines belong to
							the same category, and so do steamship lines. Public docks also play an important part
							in transportation, as do the various <pb id="VAC1119-205" n="205"/> kinds of vehicle
							transport in our cities. Strikes in any of these occupations are intolerable.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">COAL MINING</head>
						<p>It is plain that the list of industries, "which are affected with a public interest"
							can never be definitely closed. As our people have more experience with this wonderful
							and complicated way of living called modern civilization, it will, from time to time,
							be necessary to add to the list. Coal mining is an industry which we all see is so
							essential to public health and life, as well as to general business, that its
							interruption generally is scarcely less intolerable than a railroad strike. Hence, it
							seems essential that we all come to realize the necessity either of compulsory
							arbitration, or some other means, if any can be found, to secure the prompt and
							regular supply of coal to all parts of the country. Means must be found for the
							prevention of strikes in this business, and, to this end, employees, employers and the
							general public must cooperate with willing and intensive application of intelligence
							to the problem, until it is solved.</p>

						<head rend="center sc">THE LATEST PROBLEM</head>
						<p>A few years ago it would have been thought that if employers and employees could come
							to an agreement with each other, nothing more could <pb id="VAC1119-206" n="206"/>
							lave been asked or desired. It was supposed that the employer's interest would suffice
							to keep down wages, so as to supply the public with his commodity at reasonable
							prices. We now see that this is not true. In such a necessary industry as coal mining,
							it has lately been realized that when employer and employee agree, the public is not
							necessarily protected. The people must have the coal. Mine owners are in a position
							where they do not have to resist wage demands. It costs the employer nothing to raise
							wages if he can raise the price that he charges the public. Such a threat to the
							general welfare of our people can only be met by the Government itself.</p>

								cooperation would have the advantage of the human relationship which formerly
								existed when industries were smaller. Such organization is not to be a <pb

							<item><p>In the <hi rend="i">American Economic Review</hi>, of March, 1920, is an
									article on "The Nature of Our Economic Problem," by H. B. Gardner, which is
									recommended to the reader. Its view is that labor is not organized for cooperation
									with the employer, in increase of product, but for improvement of its own
									condition. The suggestion is made that laborers must be given a voice and
									responsibility in management, and a hope of reward for successful effort. The
									laborer must have a sense of responsibility for, and interest in, the
									establishment in which he works. He must be educated to realize that only through
									cooperation with the employer, in increase of production, can labor acquire its
									maximum earning power; that an advantage obtained by a special group, in higher
									wages and decreased production <pb id="VAC1119-208" n="208"/> per man, and the
									spreading out of work, is obtained at the expense of the rest of the community,
									and is negatived by like success of other groups.</p>
								<p>This writer also declares that employers can not be expected to give up the
									management, but they must learn that there is no such thing as private industry;
									that employers represent the nation, and their tenure depends upon their ability
									to organize effectively the nation's productive resources, and maintain harmonious
									relations with labor. Mr. Gardner believes that this can be obtained through
									knowledge of the facts involved and the dominance of the spirit of reason and
									far-sightedness.</p></item>

					<p>Some of the most exciting political questions which have arisen in America relate to
						money. In the primitive condition of men there was at first no money. They exchanged
						things with one another. He who had more wheat than he could use bartered it to him who
						had more wool or hides than he needed. Such exchange still takes place somewhat, but
						long ago money transactions were adopted as the most convenient form for business. A
						producer, instead of hunting for a man who needs wheat and also has a surplus of wool,
						sells his wheat to whoever will pay money for it, and with the money buys wool of
						whoever has wool to sell.</p>
					<p>Money at first consisted of any articles which were universally used and desired, such
						as skins or wampum. It has been found that gold and silver have no rivals, in
						suitability, for use as money. Their scarcity, desirability, uniform quality, and
						extensive use in the arts, are among the reasons why gold and silver have crowded out
						every other form of real money, excepting a small amount of copper.</p>


					<pb id="VAC1119-211" n="211"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CHANGING VALUES OF MONEY</head>
						<p>Money has two uses, first as a medium of exchange, and second as a measure or
							standard of value. In its use as a measure of value, it is most important that money
							itself, which is the measure of all values, should remain stable. Often a long time
							elapses between making a contract and its fulfilment. A bond may run many years. A
							building contract may require several years. A merchant requires at least a part of
							the year to sell the goods which he had earlier bought. Confusion, uncertainty and
							risk of loss, with a general injury to business, would result from any considerable
							change in the value of money between the time of making a contract and its
							fulfilment.</p>
						<p>Gold and silver change less than other things; but they do change, and at times with
							great rapidity. The discovery of new gold mines, at different times during the
							nineteenth century, together with revolutions in the art of mining, through chemical
							discoveries and mechanical improvements, all tended enormously to increase the supply
							of gold and silver. So great was the increase that the value of money underwent
							serious changes downward. A gold or silver dollar became cheaper, that is, would buy a
							smaller amount of necessaries. Under such circumstances people are apt to think that
							the prices of <pb id="VAC1119-212" n="212"/> wheat and leather have gone up, when the
							truth is that the value of the dollar has gone down.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, in spite of these deficiencies in gold and silver they remain the best
							substances for money of which the world has knowledge.</p>
						<p>The fact that the two metals have been used side by side as money gave rise to
							further complications. For a long time one gold dollar equaled fifteen silver dollars,
							but the silver supply increased until it took fifteen and a half, and later sixteen,
							silver dollars to buy a gold dollar. Finally the difference became much greater. To
							remedy this inconvenience, steps were taken, by passing laws, to abolish the use of
							silver as money except for small change. This was done by stopping the coinage of
							silver at the Government mints. Silver fell to still lower values, and ceased to be
							used as legal tender for more than five dollars.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE SILVER QUESTION</head>
						<p>The disuse of silver as money in all modern countries had the salutary effect of
							establishing a single gold standard for all values. It had been observed by economists
							that where two standards of value existed in a country, one silver and the other gold,
							the more valuable, which was gold, was sent to other countries, because there a gold
							dollar would buy more than where it competed with the <pb id="VAC1119-213" n="213"/>
							cheaper silver dollar. When America became, in 1893, a single gold standard country, a
							complaint arose to the effect that the whole scheme of abolishing the silver standard
							was a conspiracy by the financiers. It was charged, in Mr. Bryan's free silver
							campaign in 1896, that the supply of gold was too small for us to get along without
							silver. He charged that financiers were trying to get the money owing them on
							outstanding bonds paid in gold, in order to get more valuable dollars from their
							debtors than those actually loaned when the contract was made. The country,
							fortunately, decided against Mr. Bryan, partly on the ground that cheap money would
							quickly send up prices. All that the merchant, the manufacturer or the farmer would
							need to do, to offset the danger of cheap money, would be to raise his prices. On the
							other hand, wages would go up very slowly and would be paid in the cheaper money, if
							it should again become lawful to pay debts with either silver or gold. Probably more
							people were influenced by the moral consideration, that it would be wrong and
							dishonest to make old debts contracted on a gold basis payable in cheap silver money.
							Finally, business men saw that to have two kinds of money, gold and silver, would
							greatly increase fluctuations in the value of the dollar, and would injure business by
							increasing the risk of loss.</p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-214" n="214"/>

						<p>After the election of Mr. McKinley to the presidency in 1896, other things happened
							which proved the great advantage of the decision by the American people in favor of
							the single gold standard. Gold began to be produced in unparalleled quantities in
							Colorado, Alaska and South Africa. Indeed the flood of gold poured into America at
							such a rate as to cheapen the value of the metal, and, by raising prices, to create
							alarm lest the fall in gold value would cause extensive losses in business.</p>
						<p>These events had the contradictory effects of vindicating Bryan's position when he
							held that the value of money decreased as the quantity increased, or, in other words,
							that abundant money raises prices, while scarcity of money causes prices to fall. On
							the other hand, the flood of gold showed that Mr. Bryan was wrong in believing that
							the gold supply was too small for the world's business and that, in abolishing silver
							money, we had increased the fortunes of financiers at the expense of the general
							public. At any rate, free silver disappeared permanently from American politics, and
							is now advocated by no one of importance.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PAPER MONEY</head>
						<p>Serious as are the fluctuations in metal money, they are nothing when compared with
							those of paper <pb id="VAC1119-215" n="215"/> money issues. After all, the quantity of
							gold which is mined in a year has its limits, and as the gold supply becomes too
							abundant, its value falls, gold mining becomes less profitable, and the supply of new
							metal is checked. Not so with paper money. There is no limit to the amount which
							Government printing presses can turn out. A great enlargement of the supply of paper
							money, like an increase in the supply of gold, tends to raise prices of commodities,
							or, as it is described with equal correctness, to cheapen the value of money. In the
							French Revolution, in the American Revolution, in the Southern States during the
							American Civil War, and in Russia under Bolshevik rule, paper money was issued in such
							quantities that it became practically worthless. In the days of our Revolution the
							paper money of the republic was known as Continental money. Its abundance made it
							worthless, and hence the well-known expression "not worth a Continental."</p>
						<p>Governments are always in need of money, and always find new taxes unpopular. They
							are, therefore, always under the temptation to fill the treasury by printing paper
							money and forcing its acceptance by the people.</p>
						<p>In order to make the issue of paper money safe, it has been found that it must be
							convertible into gold money, which the Government promises to pay on <pb
								id="VAC1119-216" n="216"/> demand. As long as the Government can make this promise
							good, gold dollars and paper dollars are of equal value. The country is said to be on
							a gold basis. The gold reserve, which is necessary to sustain the value of paper
							money, does not need to be as great as the amount of outstanding paper, since only
							small amounts of paper would probably be presented for exchange into gold. It seems
							that a gold reserve of thirty-five or forty per cent. would be a safe proportion.
							This, in a well managed Government, prescribes a limit to the amount of paper money
							which can be safely issued.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WAR ISSUES OF PAPER MONEY</head>
						<p>In war times the amount of money which a Government must have quickly is so great
							that recourse is often had to paper money issues. This was true in America during the
							Civil War, and in Europe and America during the World War. In the United States, which
							did not enter the World War until I917, there was a great increase in the gold supply
							which had been drawn from Europe. This gold supply provided a greatly enlarged basis
							for an increased volume of paper money; but the new gold, as well as the new paper
							money, tended to raise prices, that is, to increase the cost of living. The total
							volume of all kinds of money increased during <pb id="VAC1119-217" n="217"/> the war
							so that there was nearly twice as much in circulation, for each man, woman and child,
							as there had been a number of years ago. The cost of living also increased, in much
							the same ratio. The increased cost of living, arising in part from an increased volume
							of paper money, is itself one of the necessary derangements of life following a great
							war. Such a state of affairs is unhealthy. It is abnormal and is apt, if not
							corrected, to produce such inflation of prices and credits as will, in turn, be
							followed by panic, business depression and unemployment.</p>
						<p>It may be said that large issues of paper money in wear time are a necessary evil,
							but it is equally true that a wise Government will make it an object to deflate the
							currency and bring prices and business back to normal. After the Civil War, a period
							of high prices and inflation of the currency was followed by the memorable panic of
							1873 and a period of hard times and unemployment, which lasted until 1879. During that
							time the Government made a successful effort to contract the currency, to make paper
							dollars still outstanding "as good as gold." This sound policy was attacked by the
							so-called "green-back" party and by many Democrats. John Sherman, author of the
							policy, was bitterly assailed. The charge generally made was, that he was trying to
							make the <pb id="VAC1119-218" n="218"/> volume of money less, in order to make the
							remainder more valuable. This charge was true. What was not true, in the attacks of
							paper-money advocates, was that such a policy was not for the good of the country.
							Fortunately, enough wisdom and coolness existed in the minds of most American voters
							to support the policy of Sherman and the Republican party. In 1879 paper money, still
							outstanding, was worth as much as gold, dollar for dollar. Prices and industry became
							normal. Prosperity once more returned. With the exception of the Free Silver Campaign
							of 1896, currency questions have not since become political issues.</p>
						<p>All of this experience with inflated currency shows how important it is for voters to
							support the Government in restoring the volume of money to normal, and in maintaining
							the gold standard; thus recovering as rapidly as possible from some of the evil
							consequences of war. There must be deflation. There must be contraction of currency.
							In illness, after a fierce fever, the patient must be brought back to normal health,
							by patience, care and severe self-denial. The experience which America has had in the
							double standard of gold and silver, as well as in issuing paper money, leaves no
							intelligent voter with any excuse for opposing such a policy, provided it be carried
							out with prudence.</p>
					</div3>

					<pb id="VAC1119-219" n="219"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DEPOSITS BASED ON BORROWING</head>
						<p>There is another kind of inflation, quite as serious as inflation of the
							currency,,producing the same results in the way of high prices. It is the inflation of
							credit, by Government Act. It occurs in war time, and results from the Government's
							need for a great and sudden increase of its purchasing power. Camps need to be fitted
							up, uniforms bought, munitions of every sort are required for the army. War-ships,
							submarines, air-ships, all are needed. Nay, they must be had quickly, in vast
							quantities. Ambulances, surgical supplies and food, in shape to be transported, must
							be forthcoming. Soldiers must be paid, and experts must experiment in order to produce
							new inventions for use in war. To accomplish all this, the Government calls on
							citizens to purchase bonds in enormous quantities. The people have not the ready means
							to pay for the bonds, so they buy them on credit, which the Government requires the
							banks to furnish.</p>
						<p>When a bond purchaser gives his note to the bank for ten thousand dollars of
							Government bonds, he thereby lends his credit, to that extent, to the Government. The
							Government at once receives credit, on its account with the bank, for ten thousand
							dollars. This deposit does not represent any money <pb id="VAC1119-220" n="220"/> paid
							into the bank, but consists only of a loan, of ten thousand dollars of credit by the
							bond purchaser to the Government. This transaction, repeated and multiplied millions
							of times, results in a fictitious increase or inflation of bank deposits. Banks, in
							war time, rapidly grow to several times their normal size. A bank which before the war
							had ten million dollars assets, may grow to have thirty or forty millions of assets.
							Yet no new wealth has been produced.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">EFFECT OF INFLATED CREDIT</head>
						<p>The effect of such an increase of deposits, by giving credit to the Government, is to
							give the Government a vast and sudden increase of purchasing power. Checks are drawn
							against these deposits to pay the Government expenses. Business men who sell supplies
							to the Government, soldiers, sailors and workmen, are all paid by checking upon these
							Government deposits. They, in turn, receive an increase of purchasing power, which
							they pass on to others, from whom they purchase labor or supplies.</p>
						<p>So it will be seen that increased deposits mean inflated credit, which at first gives
							more purchasing power to the Government, but later is passed on to the whole people.
							With such an increase of purchasing power, based on credit, prices naturally rise
							under the pressure of increased demand.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-221" n="221"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">RETURN TO NORMAL BY PAYING DEBTS</head>
						<p>All this is abnormal, and there is only one way, short of panic, hard times, business
							depression and unemployment, to return to normal prices and healthy business
							conditions. That way is, to extinguish the volume of fictitious credit by payment of
							debts. Government and individuals must, by economy and thrift, pay off their
							indebtedness until it has become normal. Payment must be made, not by new borrowing,
							but by producing new wealth and applying it to the reduction of debt. The greater and
							more rapid the production of new wealth, the sooner will come normal business
							conditions. Every voter ought, therefore, to advocate such a policy. If it is not
							followed; there is sure to come, sooner or later, terrible business depression.
							"Produce, economize, and pay your debts" should be the rule of the Government, and of
							private citizens, until normal prices and normal business conditions return.</p>
						<p>The kind of deposits of which we have been speaking are based on credit, and are
							entirely unlike that other kind of deposits which consist of savings, paid into the
							bank. Savings deposits do not cause inflation. They cure it, because they furnish a
							volume of saved wealth, with which debts can be paid and inflated credit deposits
							reduced.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-222" n="222"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PRICES AND PROSPERITY</head>
						<p>We have seen how inflation of the volume of money and of deposits, based not on
							savings but on indebtedness, quickly increases the purchasing power of the Government,
							and a little later the purchasing power of the whole people. We know, that this
							increased purchasing power, based on borrowing credit by the Government, rapidly
							increases the cost of living, by raising the prices of necessaries and of the
							enjoyable comforts of life. Such a fact is apt to be considered by persons who are
							interested in keeping up prices as an argument for increased inflation, and against
							the sound and reasonable policy of deflation, whether of money or deposits. Terrific
							political agitation has, again and again, been stirred up in this country, upon this
							question, by agitators, demagogues, and, most of all, by honest, well-meaning persons,
							who do not understand that sound business principles are natural laws, which must be
							obeyed if we want prosperity instead of disaster. Such people say that rising prices
							mean prosperity and falling prices mean disaster. They therefore urge continued
							inflation, because, they say, this will keep prices up and insure prosperity.</p>
						<p>The fallacy ought to be denied by every intelligent citizen. History shows that it is
							false, and the science of economics shows why it is dangerous.</p>
					</div3>


					<pb id="VAC1119-223" n="223"/>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WHAT IS REAL PROSPERITY?</head>
						<p>The question is, what is real prosperity as distinguished from prosperity which is
							unreal and fictitious? Real prosperity may be defined as that condition of business in
							which there is an abundance of employment at good wages for every one, and an abundant
							supply of necessaries and enjoyable comforts at reasonable prices. At the present
							writing, February, 1920, we have not real prosperity. It is true there is a tremendous
							demand for labor, but there is a scarcity of the things which we need to buy. Profits
							are excessive. The way out of such a condition, whenever it occurs, is not merely by
							threatening business men with punishment, but by economy, restriction of demand, hard
							work, and more of it, in mine and factory, on the farm and cattle ranch, thereby
							increasing the supply of things which we need. This will cause prices to fall. It will
							reduce profits, but profits ought not to be reduced so low as to drive men out of
							business. There must be a reasonable profit for farmers, manufacturers and merchants,
							in order to stimulate their efforts to supply the people with what they need.</p>
						<p>Whether prices go back to the old standards, will depend on whether wages go back to
							old standards. Experience shows that for the last hundred years, <pb id="VAC1119-224"
								n="224"/> wages have gone up, as a rule. When they fall back, they lose only a
							little of what has been gained. Wages, therefore, will not likely fall to the
							standards existing before the war. Under our system of private capital and private
							industry, we know that wages can gradually rise, without hurting business. Invention
							and improved business methods supply the means for increasing wages.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CAN HARD TIMES AFTER WAR BE AVOIDED? </head>
						<p>When, therefore, the question of inflation or deflation, is raised, after such a
							period of Government borrowing as that in our Civil War, or during the World War,
							every intelligent voter should know that real prosperity alone can last any length of
							time. Fictitious prosperity never lasts long. It should come to an end by increased
							work and frugality, payment of debts, and cutting Government expenses. If we continue
							extravagance, borrowing and reduced production, the result must be bankruptcy. General
							bankruptcy means panic, business depression, unemployment, loss of confidence and

					<p>Before the World War, America was guided in her relations with foreign Governments by
						very few and very simple principles. The first, originating in the advice of George
						Washington, was the avoidance of participation in European quarrels, of violent likes
						and dislikes for other nations, and of permanent or entangling alliances. Our second
						principle was the Monroe Doctrine, derivative from the first. Since we were not to
						interfere in the affairs of Europe, no European nation should extend its control of any
						part of North or South America. A third principle, originating with John Hay, was that
						of "the open door," or the territorial integrity of China. The Treaty of Versailles, to
						which President Wilson assented, probably would have amounted to our abandonment of this
						policy, as, under it, Shantung passed to Japan.</p>
					<p>A fourth position assumed by America, from the War of 1812 to the present, was the
						freedom of the seas for neutral ships, crews, passengers and cargoes. Finally, it has

						the world. Pursuant to this policy, America <pb id="VAC1119-226" n="226"/> has led the
						way in advocating the peaceful settlement of international disputes, and has set an
						example by frequently submitting the gravest controversies with foreign Governments to
						the decision of arbitral tribunals.</p>
					<p>These policies have served from the War of 1812 to the World War, which we entered in
						1917, to keep America at peace with every European power, except in the case of the
						Spanish War in 1898. Such a record has not been equaled by any other nation in modern
						times. We are a pacific people. We hate aggression, and we dread war. Washington's
						advice, the Monroe Doctrine, in short, all of our policies, have been directed to the
						one end of securing peace with honor.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">NON-INTERFERENCE IN EUROPEAN QUARRELS</head>
						<p>There have been many times when excuse was not lacking for America's entrance into
							European wars. In 1866, when Prussia declared war on Austria, we had a very recent and
							serious grievance against Austria, and might have taken sides with Prussia. During our
							Civil War the Austrian Archduke, Maximilian, of the House of Hapsburg, gave his
							support to the French invasion of Mexico, and accepted an offer to become emperor of
							that country. We were in no position to resist this violation <pb id="VAC1119-227"
								n="227"/> of the Monroe Doctrine, and had a just grievance against Austria. Yet, in
							the war with Prussia, we remained neutral, and even permitted the export of munitions
							to Austria.</p>
						<p>In 1870, when France under Louis Napoleon engaged in war with Germany, we might
							easily have made the French invasion of Mexico a ground for assisting Prussia, but,
							again, we remained neutral. During the Boer War, in 1899, the sympathies of our people
							were with the Boers. Yet there was no thought that we would take part in that war
							against Great Britain.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">EXCLUSION OF EUROPE FROM AMERICAN QUARRELS</head>
						<p>On many occasions, European powers have had excuses to take sides in American
							difficulties. During our Civil War, Great Britain was solicited by the Southern
							Confederacy for help against the North. The circumstances were extremely aggravating
							to the British. The blockade of southern ports deprived England of her regular supply
							of raw cotton. This scarcity wrought havoc among her people, and in her trade. Cotton
							spinners in Lancashire were thrown out of work, in vast numbers, for a long time.
							Economic and political disturbances of the first magnitude threatened the British
							Crown. </p>


						<pb id="VAC1119-228" n="228"/>

						<p>England went so far as to permit the Southern States to procure one or more warships
							to be fitted out in British ports. The situation was critical and gave Lincoln the
							keenest anxiety. In the end, Great Britain was prevailed on to cease her unneutral
							practises, and to keep out of the conflict. England's interference, in support of the
							Southern States, would almost certainly have destroyed the Union.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">INSTANCES OF ARBITRATION</head>
						<p>Our pacific policy of submitting disputes to disinterested arbitration tribunals has,
							again and again, served to keep us out of war, while preserving American honor. Two
							instances may be cited. The destruction of property of northern citizens by the
							warship, <hi rend="i">Alabama</hi>, fitted out in England, for the South, during our
							Civil War, gave rise to what were known as the "Alabama Claims." By agreement with
							Great Britain, these were submitted to an arbitral tribunal at Geneva, and a moderate
							judgment rendered in favor of the United States.</p>
						<p>During Cleveland's second administration, a dispute arose between Great Britain and
							Venezuela, as to the true boundary between the last named country, and adjoining
							British territory. President Cleveland, in his famous Venezuelan message, reaffirmed
							the Monroe Doctrine, that European control could not be extended over American
							territory. The dispute <pb id="VAC1119-229" n="229"/> was referred to an arbitration
							tribunal, which met at Paris in 1899, and decided the case for the most part in favor
							of Great Britain.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FREEDOM OF THE SEAS</head>
						<p>Another question which has brought us into collision with European powers, relates to
							the rights of neutral ships, crews, passengers and cargo, in time of war between
							foreign powers. During the wars between France, under Napoleon, and Great Britain, the
							rights which we asserted by virtue of our neutrality were ruthlessly violated by the
							British and the French. Unfortunately, the dispute involved us in the War of 1812; the
							wrong side of the war, that of France, being the one which we chose. The fall of
							Napoleon in 1814, brought the war to an end, but the question of the freedom of the
							seas to neutrals was not determined. The American Government still adheres to the old
							doctrine, although it is not accepted by Great Britain. In fact, the destruction of
							American life and property on the sea by German submarines involved a similar question
							in 1917, when we entered the World War.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">IMMIGRATION QUESTION</head>
						<p>The a advantages of American institutions, unequaled wages for labor, freedom from
							war, <pb id="VAC1119-230" n="230"/> as compared with other countries, have all made
							America the land of desire for other peoples. Immigrants in vast numbers have been
							admitted freely to our shores. This has given rise to many intricate
							complications.</p>
						<p>On the Pacific coast, it early became plain that Chinese immigration amounted to an
							invasion. American labor could not compete with the low wages and low living standards
							of the Chinese. Furthermore, China could spare enough people out of her four hundred
							millions to swamp us. The same thing was true, in less degree, of the Japanese, the
							Hindus and other yellow-skinned Asiatics. These facts led to the exclusion laws of the
							United States, restricting Asiatic immigration.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, some Chinese and Japanese have been admitted, under the provisions of
							our laws. They are few in number, but have raised perplexing problems in California
							and elsewhere. Should Japanese children be entitled to admission to California
							schools? Might California exclude Japanese from the privilege of owning or leasing
							land, while granting such a right to foreigners from nearly every other country in the
							world?</p>
						<p>The Japanese are a proud, intelligent, brave and ambitious people, combative, and
							influenced by an intense national pride. It would seem that some <pb id="VAC1119-231"
								n="231"/> way should be found for Japanese, and other foreigners, to have the same
							legal status as to property rights in California. It is quite common for Eastern
							States to prohibit all aliens from becoming landowners or lessees.</p>
						<p>Not infrequently, race prejudice has brought on public disorder, resulting in injury
							to foreigners. In such cases our Government has found it wise to pay damages, rather
							than leave grievances to accumulate. This was done in numerous cases of injuries to
							Chinese on the Pacific coast. It was also done in the case of the death of Italians at
							the hands of a New Orleans mob in 1890.</p>
						<p>These facts emphasize the importance of America keeping out of quarrels, between
							foreign countries, as far as possible. The presence of great numbers of immigrants,
							and children and grandchildren of immigrants, in this country, makes it only too
							probable that when we take sides in foreign quarrels the nationals of those countries,
							and their, descendants, will themselves be tempted to conflict, within our own
							borders, upon questions wholly foreign to America.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">MEXICAN QUESTION</head>
						<p>Mexico, our nearest neighbor on the south, populated by a people partly descended
							from the original <pb id="VAC1119-232" n="232"/> Indians, and partly by descendants of
							the Spanish Conquerors, has long been a source of trouble and anxiety. In 1835, that
							part of northern Mexico which now comprises our state of Texas, rebelled against the
							Mexican Government. In 1836, the rebellion resulted in the defeat of Mexico and the
							founding of an independent Government, in the revolted territory, known as the "Lone
							Star State." Nine years later, a treaty was negotiated for the consolidation of the
							"Lone Star State," with the United States. Mexico, in anticipation of such a union,
							took the position that it would constitute an act of war against her by the United
							States. This threat did not prevent the annexation of Texas. War resulted, commencing
							with Mexican border aggressions. Mexico was easily defeated, and her capital occupied
							by American troops. As a punishment for her course of action in provoking war, Mexico
							lost to the United States much territory, besides losing her claim to Texas. Territory
							now comprising California, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, with parts of Wyoming
							and Colorado, was thus acquired by the United States. Under the peace treaty Mexico
							received fifteen million dollars and was released from three million dollars of
							American claims.</p>
						<p>The slavery question was mixed up, in the <pb id="VAC1119-233" n="233"/> minds of the
							northern people, with the Mexican War. It was charged that the Democratic Party,
							itself dominated by the slave states, brought on the war of conquest, in order to
							extend slave territory. That the motive for extending slave territory was present can
							not be doubted. On the other hand, leaving slavery out of the question, it is hard to
							see any reason for Mexico's interfering with the annexation of Texas, considering that
							the territory had been independent and self-governing for nine years, and Mexico had
							practically ceased any energetic attempt to reconquer it. Furthermore, the transfer of
							the magnificent region, so lightly populated as the conquered territory was, from
							Mexico to the United States has been justified as a benefit to the whole world. Not
							until the World War, and then by Germany, was it ever suggested that Mexico had any
							moral or political right to reconquer her lost territory. The taking of territory, as
							a punishment for international crimes and the commission of acts of war, is often the
							only way, and the best way to discourage a repetition of such offenses.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">FURTHER COMPLICATIONS WITH MEXICO</head>
						<p>After many years of bloodshed aid violent disorder, Mexico, in 1877, under the great
							Diaz, secured a settled Government, which lasted until <pb id="VAC1119-234" n="234"/>
							Diaz was driven from power in 191I. During that time, Mexico invited American
							capitalists and other citizens to enter Mexico and aid in the development of her
							marvelous natural resources. These invitations were accepted. American capital was
							invested in Mexican mineral lands, oil lands, railroads, fruit ranches, banks, cotton
							mills and other factories. It was natural and necessary that Americans should enter
							Mexico to carry on these undertakings, and remain in charge of them. Indeed, without
							American support and supervision, such assistance as Mexico needed could not have been
							obtained.</p>
						<p>With the fall of Diaz, in 1911, dangerous elements in Mexico came into prominence. A
							period of disorder began, which was largely directed against American property and
							American lives. This state of affairs still continues at the present time.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WATCHFUL WAITING</head>
						<p>The general policy, under the latter portion of Taft's administration, and throughout
							that of Woodrow Wilson, may be aptly described in President Wilson's own words as
							"Watchful Waiting." Two sorts of opinion exist in this country on this perplexing
							question. The Wilson view is that Mexico must be allowed to work out her own political
							destiny. If she prefers blood and disorder, it is <pb id="VAC1119-235" n="235"/> not
							the duty of America to intervene in internal Mexican affairs for the purpose of
							establishing, by force, a régime of law, order and general security. Those who hold
							this view are apt to say that Americans went into Mexico at their own risk. They went
							to make money and took their chances. They can not now look to our Government to
							support them by force, so as to make their lives and their property secure.</p>
						<p>The other view is, that Americans went into Mexico, not merely for profit but upon
							the invitation of the Mexican Government, which desired the development of Mexican
							resources for the good of her own people, pursuant to the laws of that country. It is
							no fault of Americans, if Mexico has become the scene of constant internal war. The
							American Government was founded to protect the life, liberty and property of its
							people, alike at home or abroad. It was well enough to give Mexico a reasonable time
							to work out her own internal problems, but the policy has been tried long enough. It
							gives no promise of better success in the future than in the past. The constant
							reports of the murder of Americans in Mexico, the destruction of American property,
							even the confiscation of it by the new Mexican Constitution, without compensation to
							the owners, are all violations of international right and <pb id="VAC1119-236" n="236"
							/> duty by the Government of Mexico. There is no reason why Americans should be worse
							treated in Mexico than the citizens of other countries, but it is claimed that it is
							so. Even Japanese receive quite different treatment, it is said, as do Germans,
							British, French and South Americans.</p>
						<p>An eloquent pulpiteer recently 'declared that the Mexican question was almost wholly
							about oil lands, and he said, "I would not like to send my boy to Mexico to protect
							anybody's oil wells." The audience loudly applauded. This is one view. There is
							another. If American boys ought not to protect American oil wells in Mexico, ought
							they to protect American steel mills at Gary, or coal mines in Pennsylvania, or
							department stores in Boston? Should they have gone to Europe, to punish Germany for
							sinking American ships, and destroying the lies of American citizens on the high
							seas?</p>
						<p>The Mexican question has many angles, is more or less mixed up with party politics,
							and the facts are by no means clear. It is said that the Mexicans themselves suffer
							from internal violence, quite as much as American citizens; that the controversy is
							really about a law question, as to whether the Mexican Government or the surface
							landowner is entitled to minerals beneath the surface. It is urged that any resolute
							attempt to protect American <pb id="VAC1119-237" n="237"/> life and property in Mexico
							means war, and our people abhor the thought of it. Even successful war would not
							transform the Mexican character, and order could only be maintained by the permanent
							policing of the country by United States soldiers, a dreary and dangerous job.
							Individuals will honestly differ on this complicated question. To the author, it seems
							that a resolute and vigorous policy of protection to American rights will in the long
							run yield the better results.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE CASE OF CUBA</head>
						<p>Long after Mexico became independent of Spain, Cuba continued to remain under the
							control of the Spaniard. In other respects, the history of Cuba, down to 1898,
							resembled that of Mexico. Rebellion, bloodshed, disorder, destruction of property,
							terrible and cruel repressive campaigns of the Spaniards, constitute the story. Not
							only the interests of America, but of other countries having commercial relations with
							Cuba, suffered seriously. Much of the world's supply of sugar and tobacco came from
							Cuba, and this was subject to constant interruption. In February, 1898, the climax was
							reached, when the American battleship Maine was blown up in Havana Harbor.</p>
						<p>Three months later, the American Government <pb id="VAC1119-238" n="238"/> demanded
							that Spain abandon her control of Cuba, and retire from the Western Hemisphere. In the
							event of refusal, America would enforce her demand. A brief war ensued. The Spanish
							forces were soon defeated, and their navy sunk. Cuba became independent, except that
							we reserved the right to direct her foreign relations, and to assume temporary
							occupation of the country, whenever internal disorders made it advisable. Thereupon
							Cuba entered upon a period of peace and prosperity.</p>
						<p>The intervention in Cuba rested largely upon the duty of neighborhood. It was urged
							that if a man hears of a crime being attempted in another part of the country, remote
							from him and his home, he can not be expected personally to interfere. If, however, he
							learns that in a neighboring house a drunken man is threatening to kill wife and
							children, it becomes his duty, at every peril to himself, to go to the help of the
							threatened family. Cuba was our next-door neighbor, and her people had long cried
							aloud to heaven for help to rid them of Spanish misrule.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION</head>
						<p>Dewey's destruction of the Spanish fleet, in Manila Bay, made it necessary for

							establish security among the inhabitants. This occupation became permanent, under the
							peace treaty with Spain. The Spanish rule of the native population was ended, and we
							succeeded to the task. Since that day the islands have enjoyed a degree of peace and
							prosperity previously unknown.</p>
						<p>A question has been raised as to whether we should continue in control of the
							Filipinos or grant them independence. President Wilson's view is reported to be
							favorable to granting independence. The opposing view is based on the claim that the
							people, as a whole, are utterly unfit for self-government. It is said that they have
							neither the natural aptitude, nor the political training for such a task. Their
							weakness would make the islands an object for ambitious nations. Without the

						<head rend="center sc">THE WORLD WAR</head>
						<p>In August, 1914, Germany and Austria-Hungary, making an excuse of the Servian
							question, and the murder of the Austrian crown prince, entered upon a war of
							aggression and conquest, in <pb id="VAC1119-240" n="240"/> which they were opposed by
							France, Russia, Great Britain, and later, by Italy and Roumania. Turkey and Bulgaria
							joined Germany. President Wilson announced the American policy to be one of
							neutrality, and from time to time stated publicly that the causes of the war were
							obscure and did not concern us. Belgium was overrun and seized by Germany, without any
							reason whatever, except that it gave access to the weakest frontier of France. Our
							policy of neutrality entitled our people to export supplies to and maintain
							communication with, all the warring powers. Command of the sea was obtained and kept
							by the British navy, making access to Germany impossible.</p>
						<p>In May, 1915, the Lusitania, a British, unarmed, passenger ship sailing from New York
							to Liverpool, was torpedoed by a German submarine off the Irish coast and sunk.
							Hundreds of American passengers lost their lives in this disaster. The American
							Government made peremptory demands for assurance from Germany that the offense would
							not be repeated. Positive assurance was not given, but for a long time there was no
							further interference with ships engaged in ordinary commerce between New York and
							Liverpool. In the English Channel and elsewhere the Germans later renewed their
							submarine attacks, and other unarmed vessels, with <pb id="VAC1119-241" n="241"/>
							Americans on board, were sunk, causing further loss of American lives.</p>
						<p>In February, 1917, Germany notified the American Government that only one American
							ship each week would be permitted each way between New York and Liverpool, and then
							only if painted in a prescribed manner, and sailed by a designated route.</p>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">AMERICA ENTERS THE WORLD WAR</head>
						<p>America thereupon entered the war against Germany, in defense of her rights, and the
							rights of her citizens, to the use of the high seas. If Germany had not caused the
							death of American citizens, there is no reason to suppose we would have entered the
							war. We did not do so when Belgium was outraged, when France was invaded, nor when
							anything else happened, until our own rights were invaded. President Wilson was a
							pacific man. He had sought by every means to keep us out of war, and he was reelected
							president, in November, 1916, upon his record.</p>
						<p>Many people seem to think that a defensive war is one which is in defense of our
							territory. They think there must be an invasion of territory, actual or threatened,
							before a case is made for defensive war. This is wholly fallacious. The invasion which
							defensive war is to resist and punish, is not an <pb id="VAC1119-242" n="242"/>
							invasion of territory. It is an invasion of rights. American rights can be invaded
							upon the high seas, and even in foreign territories, quite as much as on our own soil.
							Furthermore, let it be remembered that defensive war has two objects. Of these, the
							first is to stop the invasion of American rights; and the second is to prevent a
							repetition of the crime.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PREVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES</head>
						<p>What way has been found best for preventing crimes, by individual criminals? The
							answer is, arrest and punishment of the guilty person. We do not send a criminal to
							prison or to the electric chair for revenge, but for punishment. The object of
							punishment is not to get even with the criminal, but to prevent the commission of
							future crimes, by setting an example of what will follow. This is the simple essential
							truth which underlies the whole system of criminal law, courts, jails and executions.
							It does not entirely prevent crime, but, more than anything else, it is effective in
							reducing the number of crimes. The relations between nations are like those between
							individuals, in that international crime demands punishment of the guilty, not as a
							matter of revenge, but to prevent a repetition of the crime by the guilty nation, as
							well as to discourage similar crimes by other nations.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1119-243" n="243"/>
						<p>We entered the war in defense of American rights. We prosecuted it, in order to

						<head rend="center sc">FOREIGN POLICY OF OTHER COUNTRIES</head>
						<p>The brief statement which we have made of America's policy in critical times shows
							that it is very simple, and easily understood by our people and the whole world. It is
							not so with the foreign policy of any other Government. Every other great nation has a
							vast body of definite principles, which have been adopted through centuries of
							national existence, and which have definite aims and definite methods for their
							accomplishment in every part of the world. Many of these policies are secret, some are
							known. Many of them are legitimate, some are not. Thus, Great Britain has for
							centuries had for her policy, the acquisition of territory in nearly every part of the
							world. Look at a map with the British possessions marked in red. Read <hi rend="i">The
								Expansion of England </hi>by Seeley. These are enough to show that Britain did not
							come by her possessions by accident, but by design. This does not mean that England
							has engaged in wars of conquest, in recent times. It only means that, outside of
							Europe, her policy has been to <pb id="VAC1119-244" n="244"/> gain territory, whenever
							it could be done legitimately. So, too, England has a Mediterranean, a South African,
							and a North African policy, a Persian policy, and an Indian policy, a Far Eastern
							policy, and a Near Eastern policy, and so on, for every quarter of the globe. Germany
							too wove her web of intricate policies. Japan has hers. So it is with every other
							country.</p>
						<p>These policies of other countries are practically continuous. Parties change,
							Governments rise and fall; even revolutions overturn the State, but the foreign
							policies are pursued continuously, whoever may be in power. A great many experts are
							trained from youth, in these various policies, in their development and their
							enforcement.</p>
						<p>America is like a child among its experienced elders, when it comes to foreign
							affairs. Our ambassadors and ministers have no training for their positions. They get
							only the most superficial knowledge of the intricate dealings going on around them.
							Our State Department, according to Mr. Lansing, was the only one which was entirely
							uninformed as to the actual approach of war in 1914. To us, it came like a bombshell.
							These facts should be carefully considered by those who incline to favor American
							participation in all world problems.</p>

					<pb id="VAC1119-245" n="245"/>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">LESSONS OF THE WAR</head>
						<p>It is too soon to read the story of America in the World War, so as to learn
							everything that it teaches. Yet some things stand out very clearly. We appear to have
							misled Germany into reliance upon such persistent pacifism among our people as to make
							it seem a moral certainty to her that we would not fight. We were utterly unprepared
							for war, in 1914, and we deliberately allowed that state of affairs to continue until
							the spring of 1917, which found us in the actual conflict.</p>
						<p>Pacifism is a true safeguard, which can be depended on to keep our people from
							undertaking aggressive war. On the other hand, it constitutes an" encouragement to a
							hostile country, and invites attack, thus tending to involve our country in defensive
							war. It is a dangerous thing to allow an ambitious foreign Government to think that we
							love peace so much that we will not fight. Such a course tends to bring on the very
							thing which we most wish to avoid, and that is war. It is probable that some historian
							of the future will say that the pacifist policy of America, which reached its climax
							with Mr. Wilson's reelection in November, 1916, on the issue, "he kept us out of war,"
							invited German aggression, and helped to involve us in war.</p>
					</div3>

					<pb id="VAC1119-246" n="246"/>

					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">UNPREPAREDNESS</head>
						<p>Hoping that America could keep out of the war, President Wilson, in his message to
							Congress, December, 1914, made it plain that we would make no preparations. Our
							tolerant attitude toward Mexico and the futility of our expeditions to Vera Cruz, and
							south from the Rio Grande, under Pershing, may have served to impress Germany with a
							belief that we were easy game. When, in December, 1915, Secretary of War Garrison
							presented a plan for raising an army of five hundred thousand men, it was disapproved
							by the president and Congress, and Garrison resigned, as a protest against the
							persistent policy of unpreparedness. These things must be taken into consideration
							with regard to the impression they made on Germany. There were other signs of
							unwillingness to fight. It was proposed in Congress to keep Americans from traveling
							on ships of belligerent countries. This was known as "the stay off" resolution. Other
							proposals were to prohibit the loan of money to the combatants, and the export of
							munitions to France and England. These measures did not prevail, but, taken in
							connection with Wilson's reelection, it was quite plain that the country was still
							pacifist, had not prepared, and would not prepare for war; and in that state of
							affairs, <pb id="VAC1119-247" n="247"/> Germany found encouragement to renew her
							submarine campaign.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ANY WAR MAY INVOLVE AMERICA</head>
						<p>Another lesson of the Great War was that America is liable to be drawn into any great
							conflict, no matter how remote from her interests and concerns it may at first appear
							to be. The lesson is, in effect, that we are concerned, vitally concerned, to do our
							utmost to discourage aggressive war in every part of the world. This is not only our
							moral duty as the possessor of great resources, but it is to our interest. All of
							these lessons, which have been brought home to us, tend to emphasize the same
							practical consideration. It is of prime importance that we enter upon a policy of
							systematic military and naval preparedness, and continue it permanently as a part of
							our regular national policy. It will cost something, perhaps a great deal, but it will
							be cheaper in the long run. Had we entered the war, or begun preparation to enter,
							when the <hi rend="i">Lusitania</hi> went down, millions of lives would doubtless have
							been spared. Europe would have been measurably saved from wreck. We dare not encourage

						<head rend="center sc">LEAGUE OF NATIONS</head>
						<p>For many years America has favored the creation of an international tribunal, for the
							arbitration of disputes and the prevention of war. The creation of a World Court for
							the nations was urged by America, and nearly accomplished at the two Hague
							Conferences. The League of Nations, proposed at Paris as a part of the Peace Treaty,
							is an entirely different thing. It proposes among other things a Council of nine
							representatives from nine different nations, of whom five are from Britain, France,
							the United States, Italy and Japan. This Council is not a court, but a political body,
							representing the executive branches of the various Governments. It is given great
							powers for the investigation and determination of disputes, between nations, whether
							in or out of the League. One of the greatest debates which has ever taken place in
							America is that which has arisen concerning the League of Nations covenant. On the one
							hand, President Wilson, supported by many good Americans, earnestly advocated the
							adoption of the League covenant, as it was framed at Paris and agreed to by him. This
							support was based upon the claim that such a League would greatly reduce the chances
							of war in any part of the world, and would enable the nations to reduce their
							armaments. On the other hand, the League <pb id="VAC1119-249" n="249"/> was opposed in
							its entirety by some of the ablest experts in international law and some of the
							greatest men in American public life.</p>
						<p>Between these two extremes there has grown up a body of opinion favoring a
							compromise, and these more moderate views appear to be held by a great majority of the
							people. In deference to the public opinion calling for compromise, the Senate of the
							United States adopted a considerable number of reservations, which were to become a
							part of the resolution of ratification. In nearly every case, these compromise
							reservations were agreed to by a very substantial majority of the Senate. On Friday,
							March 19, 1920, the resolution for ratification of the Peace Treaty, including the
							covenant for a League of Nations, came up for passage. In its final form this
							resolution embodied the compromise reservations, which had previously been adopted by
							the Senate. On the final vote, the Treaty and covenant for a League of Nations failed
							to secure the Senate ratification, which, to be effective, required a vote of
							two-thirds of the senators present. Forty-nine senators voted to ratify, while
							thirty-five voted against ratification. Of those who voted to ratify, twenty-eight
							were Republicans and twenty-one were Democrats. Of those who voted against
							ratification, twelve were Republicans, and twenty-three were <pb id="VAC1119-250"
								n="250"/> Democrats. Had the absent senators, who were paired, all voted, the vote
							would have stood, fifty-seven for ratification, of whom thirty-four were Republicans,
							and twenty-three were Democrats. Thirty-nine senators, would have been against
							ratification, of whom twenty-four were Democrats and fifteen were Republicans.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ARTICLE X</head>
						<p>The Tenth Article of the covenant was the one which caused the final failure of the
							effort to compromise the differences of opinion, so as to secure ratification. By this
							Article America undertook "to respect and preserve as against external aggression the
							territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the
							League." The reservation to Article X substantially altered it, so that, while America
							bound herself "to respect" the territorial integrity and existing political
							independence, of other nations, she would not be bound to "preserve" them, unless
							Congress should so decide, in any particular case, when it should arise.</p>
						<p>The argument in favor of this reservation seemed convincing to most people. Without
							the reservation, America would pledge herself, her resources, her people, to go to
							war, in any part of the world, where territorial boundaries, or political
							independence, <pb id="VAC1119-251" n="251"/> of any nation, member of the League,
							should be threatened or attacked. While, under our Constitution, Congress alone has
							power to appropriate money and to declare war, Article X, without the reservation,
							would have imposed a moral obligation, which is the strongest possible kind of an
							obligation, upon Congress to vote supplies and declare war, in support of territorial
							and political rights of foreign nations, regardless of whether or not Congress, and
							the American people, should believe at the time and under the circumstances that it
							ought to be done. It was said, with force, that the Constitutional power of Congress
							to vote supplies and declare war would be the merest sham, if, in fact, Congress was
							bound by the moral obligation of the covenant to act in a particular way. It was
							further urged that America ought to be governed by the will of the American people,
							freely expressed, and Congress could not act in accordance with the public will, if it
							were under a moral obligation to do something directly opposed to the wishes of the
							people.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, President Wilson and his supporters held that Article X was the
							very heart of the covenant, and that the reservation was a nullification of it. It was
							never made quite clear why this was so. It is possible, that, when the article was
							written, it was thought if America executed an obligation <pb id="VAC1119-252" n="252"
							/> to protect the territory and independence of every other nation, such a document
							would probably prevent aggression. Unhappily no one knew, and no one could prove, that
							this would be so. It may have been the president's judgment, but then President Wilson
							might be wrong. Furthermore, history shows that paper obligations do not prevent war
							and that the existence of greatly superior force does not always prevent the weaker
							party from acts of war and aggression.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</head>
						<p>As we have said, the debate in the United States Senate was one of the greatest which
							ever took place upon its historic floor. In fact, it is probable that this debate will
							rank second only to that which raged over the question of negro slavery.
							Statesmnanship, scholarship, patriotism, all combined to lift many of the speeches to
							the highest levels of eloquence. The great issues under consideration related to other
							portions of the Treaty besides the League of Nations covenant.</p>
						<p>While not entering into the argument at length, it seems proper to state the author's
							view, on a few points. The strongest point made in favor of the covenant was that the
							formation of the League, with its council, its assembly, its place of meeting, and <pb
								id="VAC1119-253" n="253"/> its permanent officers would afford a valuable means for
							the interchange of information and opinion. It opened the way for the moral judgment
							of the world more quickly to find expression, so that it might be brought to bear more
							promptly in any crisis which should arise. Its provisions encouraged delay in the
							commencement of war, and the substitution of discussion for conflict.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, the details of the Treaty were such as to involve America in
							disputes all over the globe upon matters which did not concern us, of which we were
							not qualified to judge. We appeared to surrender the advantages of our geographical
							position, and to make ourselves participants in the quarrels of Europe and Asia, quite
							as much as if our territory immediately adjoined, or was a part of, those continents.
							By becoming a member of the League, it was urged, with force, that America would be
							bound in many cases to adopt dangerous and unwise courses of action. In some
							instances, we would be bound by the pressure of circumstances to agree to arrangements
							which violated the moral and political standards of our Republic. Such an instance was
							that when the cession of Shantung to Japan was agreed to by the Supreme Council at
							Paris, of which President Wilson was a member. By intervening in quarrels, which were
							not our business <pb id="VAC1119-254" n="254"/> other than as a mutual friend or
							arbitrator, it was urged we would make enemies of old friends in cases where it was
							quite unnecessary to do so. Our stand on the controversy between Italy and Jugo-Slavia
							was an illustration of this. It was said that such disputes might draw us into
							conflicts with nations such as Italy, France or Great Britain, with which we would
							otherwise be at peace.</p>
						<p>In the author's opinion, the formation of the League would not change the world as
							much as its authors hoped and believed. Causes for world conflict would still exist.
							Human nature would be the same. National policies, national interests and national
							ambitions would remain unchanged. Excessive pacifism in America, together with
							military and naval unpreparedness, would invite competitors to encroach upon our
							rights just the same, whether such encroachments were through votes in the League
							Council, or through subtle or open interference with the rights and interests of our
							citizens. In fact, many believe that, in its original form, the League under Article
							X, would compel us to a much greater degree of preparedness than would otherwise be
							necessary.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">UNIVERSAL MILITARY TRAINING</head>
						<p>The question of the size and character of our army and navy is one to be settled by
							experts. The <pb id="VAC1119-255" n="255"/> people can only listen to the arguments
							and exercise their best judgment. In respect to the army, there is one point on which
							sound opinion is important. If we trust wholly to a regular army until we can
							improvise a new army, in the very hour of war, as we did in 1917, the regular army
							must be very large, and might be a menace to our own internal liberties. It would seem
							better, in a Democracy, to have a smaller standing army, and to have the young men of
							our country pass a reasonable time in a military camp as a preparatory training. In
							the event of war, they would be in a position to become efficient soldiers much more
							quickly. It has been stated that young men recruited during the war with Germany, were
							sent into the trenches, ignorant and untrained, in many cases, within a very few
							months. Such a policy has been called murder. Since our young men may be called on to
							fight for our country at any time, it is our duty to give them all the training
							possible for the discharge of such a task. It is needless to say that the mere
							existence of such a body of trained men would lend great weight to American influence
							in questions of world peace or world war. The "balance of power," unhappily, seems
							almost to be a law of nature. The old saying, "God is on the side of the heaviest
							battalions," still has an undoubted element of truth, which it is not common sense to
							ignore.</p>

						<pb id="VAC1119-256" n="256"/>

						<p>The power of Government to draft men for the army is like its power to compel the
							payment of taxes. In fact, the power of draft might not inaptly be called a part of
							the taxing power. In one case citizens are required to pay money; in the other they
							are required to fight or render other service; in both cases the object is the same,
							the support of Government. It may be said that the obligation to fight does not rest
							equally upon all citizens. This is true, for women and children, the aged and infirm,
							as well as those physically disqualified, are not subject to the obligation to enter
							the army or navy. It is much the same with the obligation to pay taxes. It rests only
							upon certain persons, those with property, those receiving a certain income, and the
							like.</p>
						<p>The raising of an army by draft is a fairer method than by volunteering. The duty
							rests upon all young men physically qualified. As the saying goes, "Old men for
							counsel, young men for war." Volunteers are usually the bravest, most patriotic and
							unselfish of our younger men. The burden ought not to be carried by them, while the
							more timid, the more selfish, the least patriotic are left at home. The burden of
							fighting, like the burden of taxes, should be distributed in the most equitable way
							that can be devised. In any event, if the American Republic is to endure, it must be
							able to <pb id="VAC1119-257" n="257"/> command the services of soldiers, just as it
							commands the money of taxpayers.</p>
						<p>An unprotected treasure, an unwatched valuable, is evidence of carelessness on the
							part of the custodian, and is a temptation to the worst and weakest people to become
							thieves. It is a breach of moral duty to offer such a temptation to others. America is
							not only in a material sense, but in a political and moral sense, the greatest
							treasure-house in the world. Have we the right to leave such a treasure unprotected?
							Is it not our duty to avoid leading the world into temptation, by leaving the door
							unbolted and unguarded?</p>

					<p>Political parties are more important in a country like America where the people rule
						through their chosen representatives, than under any other form of Government. We have
						in America about a hundred million people. Among them are to be found individuals
						holding almost every conceivable kind of opinion and urging upon the Government every
						imaginable sort of policy. How are we to get order out of such a Babel of conflicting
						tongues? What system will most encourage the success of sound opinions, and the defeat
						of unsound and dangerous ones?</p>
					<p>Experience has shown that party Government works best in the solution of these
						problems. A party is an organization of voters who agree that certain policies ought to
						be adopted or rejected by our Government. They further agree that certain candidates
						ought to be chosen in order that the policies advocated or opposed by the party may be
						adopted or rejected, as the case may be, by the Government. The result of forming such
						an organization, is that there takes place, within the party, general debate and
						discussion as to the adoption of <pb id="VAC1119-259" n="259"/> platforms and principles
						and the choice of candidates. This friendly struggle within the party goes on alike
						among its highest and its humblest members, throughout the country. People are
						everywhere awakened and interested by consideration of Governmental problems and
						policies, and if free institutions and popular Government depend more upon one thing
						than upon others, that thing is the alertness, the interest and constant concern of the
						whole people in the conduct of their Government. Besides awakening the interest of
						voters at election time, political parties serve to carry on the education of their
						members and to keep them interested between elections.</p>
					<p>The formation of a national party is a work requiring such tremendous labor by such
						great numbers of party workers, as to make it natural and necessary for these
						organizations to last over from election to election. They become permanently a part of
						our Government system. They identify themselves with more or less continuous systems of
						political ideas. They afford the means for effectively compelling the adoption by the
						Government of policies which, no matter how good, would never get anywhere if advocated
						only by unorganized and scattered individuals. So it is that political parties become
						our greatest instruments, for the education <pb id="VAC1119-260" n="260"/> of voters as
						well as the 'direction of Government policies.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE TWO-PARTY SYSTEM</head>
						<p>The moment one realizes the need in our country for political parties, the question
							arises, how many parties ought there to be? Our people have, for generations, mostly
							held the view that two, and only two, great national parties, are best. There are
							exceptions, to be considered later, but, as a rule, the two-party system is preferable
							to a larger number of parties, no one of which could get a majority of the voters.
							Under the two-party system, we do get majorities. Under any other system, what we
							usually get is the rule of a minority. It is not necessary, and under ordinary
							circumstances it is not even desirable, to have a separate party for every kind of
							political opinion. In general, all opinions, all proposed policies, can be advocated
							or opposed inside one or both of the two great national parties. If such a proposal is
							rejected by both parties, it could hardly have any prospect of success in the hands of
							a new and separate organization. European countries show the dangers and the weakness
							arising from a number of rival political organizations. They combine with one another
							in the national parliaments to make and to overthrow Governments, often for personal
							and other petty <pb id="VAC1119-261" n="261"/> reasons, and produce a degree of
							instability both in personnel and policy, which is measurably absent from American
							Government. In critical times, such intrigues, plots and more or less discreditable
							behavior of the different political groups in a European parliament often endanger the
							State itself, and certainly weaken it.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">EXCEPTIONS TO THE FOREGOING</head>
						<p>It is said that exceptions prove the rule. Certain it is, that there have arisen
							situations in American party politics where a third party was justifiable, if not
							necessary. In 1856, the Republican Party was founded because the two old parties,
							Democrats and Whigs, had alike failed to prevent the spread of negro slavery. The
							election of Lincoln in 1860, and the events of the Civil War, were followed by such
							success of the Republican Party as to have left no doubt of the wisdom of its founders
							in 1856.</p>
						<p>During the last generation the advocates of prohibition were unable to get either of
							the great national parties to adopt their policy. The Prohibition Party was formed,
							and was kept alive for many years by the zeal and devotion of its members. It never
							succeeded in winning any important elections in national politics. Nevertheless,
							prohibition arguments convinced the American people <pb id="VAC1119-262" n="262"/> to
							such an extent that this policy finds itself embodied in the Eighteenth Amendment of
							the Federal Constitution.</p>
						<p>In 1896, the gold Democrats formed a third party in order to defeat Mr. Bryan and his
							free silver policy. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt organized the Progressive Party, thus
							insuring the defeat of Taft, the Republican candidate. Many other third parties have
							been formed, but, with the exception of the Republican Party, organized in 1856, no
							third party has had control of the Government.</p>
						<p>It can not be said that no more than two parties ought ever to exist. On the
							contrary, there have been times when the two leading parties both failed to express
							the wishes and purposes of the American people. Then new parties were necessary for
							the good of the country. Yet, it amounts almost to a national misfortune when this
							happens. The two-party system, with its capacity for ascertaining the will of a
							majority of the voters, has so many advantages that the presumption is usually against
							additional party organizations.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE TWO LEADING PARTIES</head>
						<p>It is not within the scope of a non-partisan book to state in detail the policies of
							the Republican and (Democratic Parties. History shows that neither <pb
								id="VAC1119-263" n="263"/> party has always adhered to its own policies; that each
							party has, at times, under the pressure of circumstances, abandoned its own principles
							and adopted some of those advocated by its opponent. Party policies are influenced
							both by public opinion and by the personality of leaders who happen at any particular
							time to have controlling influence. Public opinion changes and so do leaders. This is
							not of itself necessarily bad. A Dutch Socialist was assailed for inconsistency
							because in 1914 his party voted against an appropriation for mobilizing the army of
							Holland, while in 1915, after the ruin of Belgium, they voted for such appropriations.
							His answer was, "If we can not learn from events, in God's name what can we learn
							from?"</p>
						<p>Both parties hold many of the same principles. At times there has "been little
							difference between them; at other times, they advocate policies which are in extreme
							opposition to each other. The country needs two great parties, so that the one in
							power may be constantly under the open criticism of its opponent. In no other way can
							corruption be exposed and inefficiency denounced with equal effectiveness.</p>
						<p>If certain leaders of the Republicans of to-day were asked to state wherein their
							party differed from its opponent, they would probably say that the <pb
								id="VAC1119-264" n="264"/> Republican Party is guided more by tie principles of
							sound business; that its ranks contain a much larger proportion of successful and
							well-trained business men; that it holds sounder views on public finance, and is more
							successful in promoting general prosperity, in which all of the people share,
							employers and employees alike. They would say that Republicans are more dependable,
							when it comes to maintaining law and order at home, as well as when questions arise as
							to the safety, security and just treatment of American citizens who are in foreign
							countries for proper and lawful purposes.</p>
						<p>If a similar question were put to Democratic leaders, they would probably say that
							they had the interests of the plain people more at heart than their opponents; that
							general prosperity chiefly benefits capitalists; that the laboring man does not get
							his share; and that it is up to the Government to see that labor gets larger rewards.
							They would say that the general public is more interested in low prices of
							commodities, than in encouraging the growth of home manufactures by a protective
							tariff. They would say that the use of force to prevent violence, during labor
							troubles, as well as the use of court injunctions is apt to defeat meritorious strikes
							and thus help the capitalist and hurt the laborer. They would say that if American
							citizens go abroad <pb id="VAC1119-265" n="265"/> to develop mines or markets, they do
							so at their own risk and have no right to expect our Government to protect them
							against unjust treatment either as to their persons or property.</p>
						<p>To this Republican leaders would answer that Government and business and the general
							welfare of our people all reach high standards just in proportion as the highest
							intelligence controls the conduct of affairs, and that their opponents allow
							themselves to be guided, not by intelligence and trained judgment, but by
							sentimentalism. Republicans would say the issue is "Mentality Versus Sentimentality."
							They would further say that the strength of the Democrats is in the old Slave States,
							where the negro question is always paramount; and that Democratic leaders shape their
							policies so as to get enough votes in Northern States to help the South control the
							Government; that Democrats are, therefore, apt to sacrifice the general welfare, for
							the ultimate purpose of maintaining white ascendency over negro majorities in the
							South. Democrats might answer that the whole country would suffer from negro
							domination in Southern States; and that the greed of northern Republican capitalists,
							for special privileges from the Government, was their controlling motive, politically
							speaking. This argument might be carried on to great lengths. <pb id="VAC1119-266"
								n="266"/> It is sufficient to say that neither side states the whole truth. People
							will differ as to which offers the better program, being influenced by what they think
							is to their own interest, by individual temperament, by their associations, by the
							thoroughness of their education, the extent of their reading and the scope of their
							experience.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">INDEPENDENT VOTERS</head>
						<p>Since we believe in parties, and that two parties are better than a larger number,
							ought every one to join a political party? Is there no proper place for independent
							voters? We answer that most voters should belong to one of the two great parties. The
							average man has not the time properly to investigate all political issues. He should
							accept the leadership of others, and this he gets within his party. If every one voted
							independently, there would be no parties at all. Even if very large sections of voters
							did so, party Government would be weakened, if not destroyed. Nevertheless, it is a
							good thing to have a small number of citizens who are able to vote with real
							independence, and to cross No Man's Land, which separates Republicans and Democrats,
							whenever the general welfare of the republic demands it. Such people rarely hold
							office. They are usually unorganized and act <pb id="VAC1119-267" n="267"/> from
							individual conviction. They often turn elections and help to punish corruption and
							incompetence in high places. They do not break up the great parties, because their
							numbers are too few, and so they ought to be. As a rule, they suffer for their
							independence, but time and again when crises have arisen in public affairs, the
							independent voter has done great service for his country. There is need for him, but
							it is not a course which ought to be followed by many, nor is it likely to be.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE CHOICE OF A PARTY</head>
						<p>When an American citizen is about to cast a ballot for the first time, which party
							should be chosen? The answer we would make, is: "Vote with the older and more
							experienced members of your own family. There will be time enough to change your party
							later, when you have had more political experience, and when judgment has attained
							greater maturity." It may be objected that this means letting things go on, in the
							same old rut; that there would be no improvement in social conditions. To this we
							reply that America has not done so badly. We have outstripped every other country.
							With all our shortcomings, our people are the happiest, the freest, the most
							prosperous in the world. Immigrants are constantly leaving their old homes and <pb
								id="VAC1119-268" n="268"/> coming to America to obtain a share in our blessings.
							Many more would come, if they could. What other proof is needed to show with regard to
							America that "The Lord hath not dealt so with any nation"?</p>
						<p>Furthermore, let it be remembered that within one's own party there may be found full
							scope for one's energies in supporting sound policies and the best candidates. Neither
							party always achieves its best, and both often fall far below it. The surest way to
							improve our Government is to improve our parties.</p>
						<p>Nevertheless, all that has been said is subject to one great qualification. If a
							party deliberately decides to advocate a false, unsound, or dangerous program, which
							is contrary to the principles of sound Government, as laid down by our greatest
							patriots and proved by our past experience, then one should avoid that party. It needs
							to be rebuked. It must be drawn back into the right path by the chastisement of
							defeat.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">THE PARAMOUNT ISSUE</head>
						<p>One of the great difficulties of Government by the people through political parties
							is that an election nearly always presents a number of important issues to be settled.
							Tariff, currency, the enforcement <pb id="VAC1119-269" n="269"/> of law, the use of
							the army and of injunctions in labor disputes, questions of foreign policy, even of
							war and peace, all may arise at once. A conscientious voter who places his country's
							good above every other consideration, may find that the Republicans are right on some
							questions, and the Democrats right on others. He may find one party better on national
							issues, and the other on local issues. Under such confusing circumstances, it is of
							prime importance that the voter ascertain what is the paramount issue, and,
							disregarding or postponing minor questions, cast his ballot for the right policy upon
							the most important issue.</p>
						<p>It is probable that Mr. Bryan first gave us the true significance of "paramount
							issue." Before a campaign closes the people see pretty clearly what is most important.
							In 1896 Republicans tried to make tariff the issue, but by election time every one
							knew that the gold standard was the principal thing at stake.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">PUBLIC OPINION AND THE CHOICE OF LEADERS</head>
						<p>A book might be written about Public Opinion in a Democracy. A. Lawrence Lowell has,
							indeed, written a good one, called <hi rend="i">Public Opinion and Popular
								Government</hi>. In such a country as ours, it becomes of supreme importance to have
							a sound public opinion. To this end it is necessary to <pb id="VAC1119-270" n="270"/>
							be on our guard against those influences which are apt to make for unsound and
							dangerous views. Newspapers are certainly the most important agency for the formation
							of opinion. Yet some of them are false prophets, some are mistaken, some are
							inconsistent. It is well to consider the history of a paper, its reputation among the
							best informed people, its definite bias, its ownership and the personality of its
							editors. Independent newspapers are apt to be more profitable in a commercial sense
							than party organs, and are now much in favor. As a rule, the debt of our country to
							its newspapers is great, particularly to independent journals. Yet they may be very
							dangerous. A bitter partisan editor, writing in an independent paper, may deceive the
							unthinking.</p>
						<p>The same considerations apply to critical weeklies and to important monthlies which
							deal with public affairs. Thoughtful and patriotic people should read widely and
							seriously upon political questions, but they should select what they read with the
							utmost care.</p>
						<p>What are busy men and women to do who have little time or strength for reading and
							reflection on public affairs? For these, the best resource is to select the ablest
							leader they know of, and follow his judgment as far as it seems sound. Let them <pb
								id="VAC1119-271" n="271"/> learn the elementary principles of good Government and
							reject leadership which does not uphold those principles. Rhetoric and eloquence do
							not always go with practical common sense. Even great national leaders are sometimes
							unsafe guides. As a rule, however, our leading political parties do bring to the front
							able leaders. Lincoln, Cleveland, Roosevelt, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley,
							Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Stephen A. Douglas, to mention no living man, were all of
							this type. Nevertheless, in selecting guides for our opinions, we should always
							remember that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." We need to be on our guard
							against accepting plausibility in the place of clear thinking; eloquence instead of
							scientific study and thorough information; pride of opinion rather than an honest
							search for truth. Partisan bias, self-seeking and self-interest often masquerade under
							the false pretense of devotion to the general welfare.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, public opinion is not infallible any more than individual opinion.
							History shows that again and again the people have gone crazy. They have stoned or
							crucified their wisest and best men. They have seemed to go insane about religion,
							about military conquest, about finance and speculation. They will do this again unless
							they become wiser, <pb id="VAC1119-272" n="272"/> acquire more self-restraint, show
							greater insight into the character and ability of their leaders, and are more
							thoroughly educated in the lessons of history. All this should not discourage us. It
							should only spur us to greater efforts and greater disinterestedness, in the service
							of our country and the control of its policies.</p>

					<p>During the French Revolution, Condorcet declared that if Rousseau's doctrine that every

						of utility, matters little. The important thing, for the American Commonwealth, is the
						use which women will make of their new political power.</p>
					<p>It should be clearly seen and frankly admitted that Democracy is the most difficult of
						all kinds of Government; yet, it is the only possible kind for America. It is not too

						the ones who struggle with the indifferent voter, to get him to come to primaries and to
						vote at every election. They are the ones who best know the ignorant voter who must be
						induced to accept intelligent leadership. Party workers know better than the rest of us
						the trouble of getting honest and dependable officials for every election precinct, both
						in the party organization and for conduct of the voting. These troubles are certainly
						increased, probably doubled, by woman suffrage. The same thing is true of the whole
						complex mass of national policy and business.</p>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">DIFFICULTIES NO DISCOURAGEMENT</head>
						<p>The difficulties of Democracy and their increase by the enfranchisement of women, are
							no argument against the system or against enlarged suffrage. They are only mentioned
							to bring home to the voter a sense of responsibility. Another fact about woman
							suffrage ought not to be forgotten. Suffrage <pb id="VAC1119-275" n="275"/> for men
							came very gradually. At first the right belonged to wealthy landowners. Gradually the
							circle was enlarged. Year after year, generation after generation, passed before the
							right to vote was achieved for every adult male. To this, the only exception was the
							sudden enfranchisement of the American negro, after the Civil War. The enfranchisement
							of women, for the greater part of the United States, will come at a single stroke. A11
							at once they are to be confronted with the solemn responsibilities of full
							citizenship. It is no easy thing for them to take up this new burden and qualify
							themselves for the discharge of their political duties.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">ADVANTAGES OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE</head>
						<p>As an offset to the new difficulties arising from this sudden increase in the number
							of our voters, many advantages can now be foreseen. A striking proof of the fitness of
							women for the ballot has been given by the skill, courage and political strategy with
							which they have urged their cause. The negro did not win his suffrage. It was thrust
							upon him. Not so with women. They will have achieved it by their own efforts, and, in
							so doing will have shown that they possess the qualifications for all the rights of
							citizenship.</p>
						<p>It has been pointed out more than once in these <pb id="VAC1119-276" n="276"/> pages
							that the first danger in a Democracy is lack of interest on the part of voters. What
							would become of us, if only a half dozen Government officials attended the polls on
							election day, put in such ballots as they thought advisable, and made such a return of
							the pretended result as their interests dictated? There is good authority for saying
							that this is just about what happens in many Latin countries where universal manhood
							suffrage exists. The inertia of Americans has been overcome, as a rule, by the energy
							of party workers, but it would seem that women will be a powerful reenforcement in
							this work.</p>
						<p>There is reason to believe that women will be better informed than men upon the
							merits of public questions. They have more leisure for reading. They have a natural
							aptitude for study and the use of books. In coeducational colleges, scholastic honors
							go rather oftener to women than to men. They have either greater quickness or capacity
							for learning or they give more time to study.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">WOMEN AND FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES</head>
						<p>The greatest factors in good Government are often the simplest. If we look back
							through these pages, we shall find that they have been mostly filled with the
							discussion of the simplest, most fundamental, <pb id="VAC1119-277" n="277"/> and yet
							most vitally important matters. There is reason to believe that women will grasp such
							questions with a quickness and a clarity of vision denied to men. Is it a question of
							maintaining the authority of Government, the security of life and property, in the
							home and on the streets? If so, women will grasp the fundamental necessity of law and
							order, and cling to it more tenaciously than men. Is it the conduct of our public
							schools which is up for discussion, the maintenance of discipline, the subjects for
							instruction, the qualifications and pay of teachers, the instruction of pupils in the
							sacredness of family life and the duties of citizenship? The very naming of these
							subjects suggests that the wife and mother will take more interest and exercise better
							judgment in school elections than the husband and father.</p>
						<p>Again, is it a question of taxes, of public economy, of official waste? It is common
							experience that those households which practise economy, ar those in which the woman
							is herself an economist. If the question of frugality depends upon the man, household
							affairs are usually at loose ends. Therefore, let us earnestly hope that women will
							recognize far more than men that every addition to the burden of taxes, makes an
							increase in the general cost of living, and that the time to prevent excessive <pb
								id="VAC1119-278" n="278"/> taxation is when appropriations are voted, and taxes
							levied, by Congress, by legislatures, by city and county councils, and by boards of
							school commissioners.</p>
						<p>Is the question one which involves the right of private property, the right to save,
							to accumulate and to dispose of one's savings, at death, by leaving it to children or
							dependents? It is impossible to doubt that women will more generally see the
							significance of such an issue, and its bearing upon family life, than men do. They
							will see the problem more clearly and they will be more instantly alert, more
							constantly concerned with its solution.</p>
						<p>Is the issue tendered, one of Government ownership? Will not the woman, the
							housekeeper, realize more thoroughly than the man what poor results are usually to be
							expected from public officials in the way of public service, when compared with those
							obtained in private business? Are women likely to be deceived into thinking that
							streets are kept cleaner than homes, that paving repairs are kept up as well as
							repairs in a prosperous factory, that city hospitals are better run than private ones,
							that public officials, as a rule, are as efficient and work as hard as those employed
							in private business?</p>
						<p>So with inflation of currency and of credit. Women will quickly grasp the teachings
							of sound <pb id="VAC1119-279" n="279"/> political economy. They will learn that
							inflated currency and credit are unhealthy stimulants, which must be gradually
							withdrawn if normal prices and normal living costs are to return. Women will not be
							fooled into thinking that we can have real prosperity, when scarcity and high prices
							for necessaries make themselves felt in every household.</p>
						<p>Nor can we doubt the great contribution which women will make to public opinion, and
							public policy, upon moral issues. The prevention of vice, the enforcement of liquor
							laws, and of laws regulating the sale of habit forming drugs, are subjects which are
							certain to hold the interest of women. Their votes will put strength into the arm of
							the law, and courage into the heart of the prosecutor and the judge.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">OTHER ISSUES</head>
						<p>It is not possible to mention all pending reforms in which women can instantly render
							a service to their country, but we give the following illustrations. One of the
							sources of inefficiency in public administration is the appointment to office of
							unqualified persons on account of political and party influence. To remedy the gross
							evils of the "spoils system," the last generation saw the beginning of the civil
							service reform movement. The passage of acts by Congress was finally secured, <pb
								id="VAC1119-280" n="280"/> under which many Federal appointments were transferred
							from the politicians to boards of examination who pass on the qualifications of
							applicants for office. Without doubt this reform has done much good. It is true that
							there have been gross violations, both of the letter and the spirit of the law. It is
							also true that even civil service appointees fall into bureaucratic routine and
							slackness. Nevertheless, the system, once thoroughly approved by the public and
							zealously applied by Government heads, can do much more good.</p>
						<p>A particular field, where the harvest is white and the reapers few, is that of the
							extension of civil service reform to state, county and city offices. Women voters, if
							they choose to enter this field, to master the problem on its technical side, and to
							push the reform through to success, can bring about amazing improvement in the conduct
							of public business, both by stopping waste and increasing efficiency.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR VOTERS</head>
						<p>Many thoughtful students of American institutions believe that with compulsory
							education we are entitled to require all voters to qualify themselves to some extent
							in the way of education before actually being entitled to share in the Government of
							their <pb id="VAC1119-281" n="281"/> country. It is incontrovertible that ignorance is
							a menace. A modest educational qualification, for both men and women voters hereafter
							acquiring the right of suffrage, would by no means exclude all unfit persons from the
							ballot box. It would, however, slightly raise the level and improve the quality of
							political action by the people. Since opportunity for education is offered to all, all
							could qualify. If there be not courage for such a law with respect to persons now
							entitled to vote, it could be brought into effect slowly through being made applicable
							only to future voters.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">IMMIGRATION PROBLEM</head>
						<p>Immigration of foreigners to America reached such a point before the World War that
							thoughtful students were greatly alarmed as to its probable effect on the future of
							our republic. A law was passed by Congress, over the presidential veto, which imposed
							a slight educational qualification. The question, however, is still an open one. On
							the one hand, America needs unskilled labor. Our prosperity depends upon it. Our
							industries must languish without it. On the other hand, the presence of vast bodies of
							foreigners in our midst, often anarchistic in opinion and hostile to our institutions,
							constitutes a danger which we dare not ignore. It <pb id="VAC1119-282" n="282"/> would
							seem that able and intelligent women, by making an intensive study of this question,
							might be able to propose a solution in a field where men have failed, as yet, to reach
							one.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SOURCES OF PROGRESS</head>
						<p>Let us pass from particular political problems to the more general question of human
							improvement and human progress. What is it which constitutes the source of improvement
							and advancement in human society? Men were once barbarians; they are now civilized.
							The whole scale of living and the whole standard of comfort, for every class of
							society, have undergone amazing elevation. We have reached a condition of order,
							security and peace in our daily lives beyond that attained at any time in human
							history. Whence does this progress come? In what clear mountain region do the pure
							waters of life gush forth? How may we best help to continue the upward movement of
							humankind?</p>
						<p>The answer is that the source of progress is in the human mind, and, for the most
							part, in the minds of superior and gifted individuals. It was in the brain of Moses
							that the Ten Commandments were written before they were inscribed on the tables of
							stone. It was in the brain of Robert Fulton that the first steamboat voyaged long
							before it <pb id="VAC1119-283" n="283"/> traveled on the waters of the Seine. It was
							in the intellects of George Washington and John Adams, of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
							Jefferson and Patrick Henry that the Government of the United States was constructed,
							before it was formulated in the Constitution. Long before the mighty Lincoln reached
							the White House, his genius had conceived of a free America where not a single slave
							cowered before a master's lash.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">SCIENCE AND PROGRESS</head>
						<p>It would not be sufficient to account for human progress if we ascribed it wholly to
							the ability and efforts of individual great men, appearing here and there to brighten,
							by their genius, the hard pathway of human struggle. Science represents the collective
							effort of all these great ones and of many more. It is science which patiently records
							the facts of human life, observes causes and effects, discovers reasons for our
							failures, and rejoices when the factors of success are at last definitely
							recognized.</p>
						<p>Science not merely observes the facts; she interprets them. For thousands of years,
							the whole human race experienced the common phenomenon of a thunder-storm. The savage
							in his dug-out wondered and trembled no more than the proudest Roman Senator. Millions
							of human beings saw <pb id="VAC1119-284" n="284"/> the flash of lightning, heard the
							roar of thunder, every year of their lives. Not one of them understood, until Benjamin
							Franklin interpreted the phenomena for all time. The electric spark, which flashed
							from the key on Franklin's kite string, gave him the answer to the riddle. That
							moment. was born the modern science of electricity. To Franklin's interpretation have
							been added the discoveries of thousands who came after him.</p>
						<p>We can not stop to speak of the sciences of chemistry, of metallurgy, of engineering,
							of navigation. We pass to the subject of the science of Government. Let it be
							understood that political science has its discoverers, its record of facts, its
							interpretation of political phenomena. As the science of Government observes the
							facts, interprets them and states the laws of nature, which govern men in their
							political relations, so it is the function of the science of economics to observe and
							interpret the facts of life in our economic relationships, and to state the natural
							economic laws which govern men.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">MEN'S DEFICIENCIES IN SCIENTIFIC TRAINING</head>
						<p>If we critically observe the operations of Government during the time that men have
							been in control, we shall be struck at once with their lack of scientific knowledge
							and scientific training. Sit in <pb id="VAC1119-285" n="285"/> the gallery at
							Washington and watch either branch of Congress; go to any state legislature, listen to
							the discussions, observe the work that is done. The wonder of it all is that they have
							done so well, have passed such wise laws, have achieved such excellent Government.
							They have done all this, lacking adequate knowledge, with insufficient training, with
							too little study, and too little time to make up lost ground, after they come to the
							seats of Government.</p>
						<p>It is to be hoped that women will supply this deficiency. They have the aptitude and
							the time for the study of the sciences, of politics and of economics. It is from these
							sciences, which daily make new discoveries, and record new truths, that women can
							obtain the material for the improvement of Government. It may well be that women, far
							more than men, will organize clubs for these studies. Some will specialize in one
							branch, some in another. They will not depend on casual and occasional glimpses into a
							subject. These students will make their specialties matters of life-long concern. They
							will be thorough, will be satisfied with nothing less than the truth, will speak with
							authority when they do speak, and will be recognized, trusted and followed as expert
							authorities in their particular branches. This is the author's dream of the way that
							women will help to bring <pb id="VAC1119-286" n="286"/> democratic institutions to a
							higher degree of perfection. May it come true!</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">BENEFITS OF THE WORLD WAR</head>
						<p>It is probable that human history holds the record of not more than two or three
							periods in which such magnificent opportunity for the application of scientific truth
							to the problems of political life was afforded as in our day. The World War has
							uncovered mines of new political and economic truth, to an extent which is not yet
							generally understood. That war, terrible as it was, nevertheless will play its part in
							improving the future of mankind. In Russia, we see the utter breakdown, under actual
							trial, of Marx's socialist theory of economics. In Russia, too, we find that the most
							patient, long suffering population in the world at last found a way to throw off
							despotic rule. In Germany, we observe the results of excessive nationalism and the
							undue encouragement of militaristic organization and ambition. In France, we see, as
							we do in Belgium, the marvelous capacity of men and women for endurance under hardship
							when animated by the supreme enthusiasm which sacrifices all for the sake of home and
							country. In Great Britain, we observe a labor struggle, which might almost be called a
							war within a war. In <pb id="VAC1119-287" n="287"/> America, we experimented with
							military unpreparedness, to our cost and, amid plundering and blundering, managed at
							last to achieve magnificent military results. We also worked out, not a theory merely
							but a system of Governmental control of the necessaries of life, the quantities in
							which they might be used, the prices at which they could be bought, on a scale never
							before attempted. These and many other facts are waiting, like gold in the mine, to be
							dug out, refined and placed in circulation as the coins of scientific truth. They
							require to be studied, analyzed and interpreted, as was the thunder-storm by Franklin.
							Upon their painful lessons America will build her future.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 type="section">
						<head rend="center sc">CONCLUSION</head>
						<p>The upshot of it all is, that progress will be helped by truth, by science, by proved
							and tested principles. It will be retarded by falsehood, by quackery, by unproved and
							untested theories of charlatans and radicals, of revolutionists and of ignorant
							agitators. Not in the excited assembly of the agitated multitude, but in the study and
							the laboratory will the problems of political and economic life be solved.<lb/>
