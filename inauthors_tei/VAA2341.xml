                        And it is the pretty unanimous practice of book-writers to continue to write them with such
                        pains and elaborateness as would indicate a belief that the success a graceful preface. My
                        principal embarrassment is that it is then shall I choose between the half-dozen letters of
                        introduction I might give my story, each better and worse on inclined to adopt the following,
                        which might for some reasons be styled the.</p>

                    <head>PREFACE SENTIMENTAL.</head>
                    <p>Perhaps no writer not infatuated with conceit, can send out a book full of thought and feeling
                        which, whatever they may be of his offspring. And there are few prefaces which do not in some
                        way betray this nervousness. I confess to a respect for even the prefatory doggerel of good
                        Tinker Bunyana respect for his paternal tenderness toward his book, not at all for his
                        villainous rhyming. When I saw, the other day, the white handkerchiefs of my children mud-clerk
                        on the Iatan, and the shaggy lord of Shady-Hollow Castle, and the rest, that have watched with
                        me of nights and crossed the <pb id="VAA2341-005" n="6"/> ferry with me twice a day for half a
                        yeareven now, as I see them waving me adieu with their red silk and &quot;yaller&quot;
                        cotton &quot;hand-kerchers,&quot; I know how many rocks of misunderstanding and
                        criticism and how many shoals of damning faint praise are before them, and my heart is full of
                        misgiving.</p>
                    <p>But it will never do to have misgivings in a preface. How often have publishers told me this! Ah!
                        if I could write with half the heart and hope my publishers evince in their advertisements,
                        where they talk about &quot;front rank&quot; and &quot;great American
                        story&quot; and all that, it would doubtless be better for the book, provided anybody would
                        read the preface or believe it when they had read it. But at any rate let us not have a preface
                        in the minor key.</p>
                    <p>A philosophical friend of mine, who is addicted to Carlyle, has recommended that I try the
                        following, which he calls</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 type="section">
                    <head>THE HIGH PHILOSOPHICAL PREFACE.</head>
                    <p>Why should I try to forestall the Verdict? Is it not foreordained in the very nature of a Book
                        and the Constitution of the Reader that a certain very Definite Number of Headers will
                        misunderstand and dislike a given Book? And that another very Definite Number will understand it
                        and dislike it none the less? And that still a third class, also definitely fixed in the Eternal
                        Nature of Things, will misunderstand and like it, and, what is more, like it only because of
                        their misunderstanding? And in relation to a true Book, there can not fail to be an Elect Few
                        who understand adminingy and understandingly admire. Why, then, make bows, write prefaces,
                        attempt to prejudice the Case? Can I change the Reader? Will I change the Book? No? Then away
                        with Preface! The destiny of the Book is fixed. I can not foretell it, for I am no prophet. But
                        let us not hope to change the Fates by our prefatory bowing and scraping.</p>
                    <p>I was forced to confess to my friend who was so kind as to offer to lend me this preface, that
                        there was much truth in it and that truth is nowhere more rare than in prefaces, but it was not
                        possible to adopt it, for two reasons: one, that <pb id="VAA2341-006" n="7"/> my proof-reader
                        can not abide so many capitals, maintaining that they disfigure the page, and what is a preface
                        of the high philosophical sort worth without a profusion of capitals? Even Carlyle&apos;s
                        columns would lose their greatest ornament if their capitals were gone. The second reason for
                        declining to use this preface was that my publishers are not philosophers and would never be
                        content with an &quot;Elect Few,&quot; and for my own part the pecuniary interest I have
                        in the copyright renders it quite desirable that as many as possible should be elected to like
                        it, or at least to buy it.</p>
                    <p>After all it seems a pity that I can not bring myself to use a straightforward</p>

                    <head>APOLOGETIC AND EXPLANATORY PREFACE.</head>
                    <p>In view of the favor bestowed upon the author&apos;s previous story, both by the Public who
                        Criticise and the Public who Buy, it seems a little laid in the valley of the Ohio. But the
                        picture of Western country life in &quot;The Hoosier School-Master&quot; would not have
                        been complete And indeed there is no provincial life richer in material if only one knew how to
                        get at it.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is more reverent than a wholesome hatred of hypocrisy. If any man think I have offended
                        against his religion, I must believe that his religion is not what it should be. If anybody
                        shall imagine that this is a work of religious controversy leveled are, unfortunately, pretty
                        widely distributed. However, if</p>
                    <p>And so on.</p>
                    <p>But why multiply examples of the half-dozen or more that I might, could, would, or should have
                        written? Since everybody is agreed that nobody reads a preface, I have concluded to let the book
                        go without any.</p>

                        closed the teeth down in a dead-lock way over the tongue, and compressed the lips tightly over
                        the teeth, and shut his finger-nails into his work-hardened palms. And then, distrusting all
                        these precautions, fearing lest he should be unable to hold on to his temper even <pb
                            id="VAA2341-011" n="12"/> with this grip, the little man strode out of the house with his
                        wife&apos;s shrill voice in his ears.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson had good reason to fear that her daughter was in love with a
                        &quot;Dutchman,&quot; as she phrased it in her contempt. The few Germans who had
                        penetrated to the West at that time were looked upon with hardly more favor than the
                        Californians feel for the almond-eyed Chinaman. They were foreigners, who would talk gibherish
                        instead of the plain English which everybody could understand, and they were not yet civilized
                        enough to like the yellow saleratus-biscuit and the &quot;salt-rising&quot; bread of
                        which their neighbors were so fond. Reason enough to hate them!</p>
                    <p>Only half an hour before this outburst of Mrs. Anderson&apos;s, she had set a trap for her
                        daughter Julia, and had fairly caught her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jule! Jule! O Jul-y-e-ee!&quot; she had called.</p>
                    <p>And Julia, who was down in the garden hoeing a bed in which she meant to plant some
                        &quot;Johnny-jump-ups,&quot; came quickly toward the house, though she knew it would be
                        of no use to come quickly. Let her come quickly, or let her come slowly, the rebuke was sure to
                        greet her all the same.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you come when you&apos;re called, <hi rend="i">I&apos;d</hi>
                        like to know! You&apos;re never in reach when you&apos;re wanted, and you&apos;re
                        good for nothing when you are here!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia Anderson&apos;s earliest lesson from her mother&apos;s lips had been that she was
                        good for nothing. And every day and almost every hour since had brought her repeated assurances
                        that she was good for nothing. If she had not been good for a great deal, she would long since
                        have been good for nothing as the result of such teaching. But though this was not the first,
                        nor <pb id="VAA2341-012" n="13"/> the thousandth, nor the ten thousandth time that she had been
                        told that she was good for nothing, the accustomed insult seemed to sting her now more than
                        ever. Was it that, being almost eighteen, she was beginning to feel the woman blossoming in her
                        nature? Or, was it that the tender words of August Wehle had made her sure that she was good for
                        something, that now her heart lelt her mother&apos;s insult to be a stale, selfish,
                        ill-natured lie?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take this cup of tea over to Mrs. Malcolm&apos;s, and tell her that it
                        a&apos;n&apos;t quite as good as what I borried of her last week. And tell her that
                        they&apos;ll be a new-fangled preacher at the school-house a Sunday, a Millerite or
                        somethin&apos;, a preachin&apos; about the end of the world.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not say &quot;Yes, ma&apos;am,&quot; in her usually meek style. She smarted
                        a little yet from the harsh words, and so went away in silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she walk fast? Had she noticed that August Wehle, who was &quot;breaking
                        up&quot; her father&apos;s north field, was just plowing down the vest side of his land?
                        If she hast-ened, she might reach the cross-fence as he came round to it, and while he was yet
                        hidden from the sight of the house by the <unclear>tu-</unclear> of the hill. And would not a
                        few words from August Wehle be pleasant to her cars after her mother&apos;s sharp
                        depreciation? It is at least safe to conjecture that some such feeling made her hurry through
                        the long, waving timothy of the meadow, and made her cross the log that spanned the brook
                        without ever so much as stopping to look at the minnows glancing about in the water flecked with
                        the sunlight that struggled through the boughs of the water-willows. For, in her thorough
                        loneliness, Julia Anderson had come to love the <pb id="VAA2341-013" n="14"/> birds, the
                        squirrels, and the fishes as companions, and in all her life she had never before crossed the
                        meadow brook without stooping to look at the minnows.</p>
                    <p>All this haste Mrs. Anderson noticed. Having often scolded <figure entity="VAA2341-2">
                            <p rend="center">TAKING AN OBSERVATION.</p>
                        </figure> Julia for &quot;talking to the fishes like a fool,&quot; she noticed the
                        omission. And now she only waited until Julia was over the hill to take the path round the fence
                        under shelter of the black-berry thicket, until she came to the clump of elders, from the <pb
                            id="VAA2341-014" n="15"/> midst of which she could plainly see if any conversation should
                        take place between, her Julia and the comely young Dutchman.</p>
                    <p>In fact, Julia need not have hurried so much. For Augus t Wehle had kept one eye on his horses
                        and the other on the house all that day. It was the quick look of intelligence between the two
                        at dinner that had aroused the mother&apos;s suspicious. And Wehle had noticed the work on
                        the garden-bed, the call to the house, and the starting of Julia on the path toward Mrs.
                        Malcolm&apos;s. His face had grown hot, and his hand had trembled. For once he had failed to
                        sec the stone in his way, until the plow was thrown clean from the furrow. And when he came to
                        the shade of the butternut-tree by which she must pass, it had seemed to him imperative that the
                        horses should rest. Besides, the hames-string wanted tightening on the bay, and old
                        Dick&apos;s throat-latch must need a little fixing. He was another he managed to delay
                        starting his plow until Julia came by, and then, though his heart had counted all her steps from
                        the door-stone to the tree, then he looked up surprised. Nothing could be so astonishing to him
                        as to see her there! For Jove is needlessly crafty, it has always an instinct of concealment, of
                        indirection about it. The boy, and especially the girl, who will tell the truth frankly in
                        regard to a love affair is a miracle of veracity. But there are such, and they arc to be
                        rcverenced with the reverence paid to martyrs.</p>
                    <p>On her part, Julia Anderson had walked on as though she meant to pass the young plowman by, until
                        he spoke, and then she started, and blushed, and stopped, and nervously broke off the top of a
                        last year&apos;s iron-weed and began to break it into <pb id="VAA2341-015" n="16"/> bits
                        while he talked, looking down most of the time, but lifting her eyes to his now and then. And to
                        the sun-browned but delicate-faced young German it seemed a vision of Paradise every glimpse of
                        that fresh girl&apos;s face in the deep shade of the sun-bonnet. For girls&apos; faces
                        can never look so sweet in this generation as they did to the boys who caught sight of them,
                        hidden away, precious things, in the obscurity of a tunnel of pasteboard and calico!</p>
                    <p>This was not their first love-talk. Were they engaged? Yes, and no. By all the speech their eyes
                        were capable of in school, and of late by words, they were engaged in loving one and separated
                        by circumstances, and they had hardly begun to think of marriage yet. It was enough for the
                        present to love and be loved. The most delightful stage of a love affair is that in which the
                        present is sufficient and there is no past or future. And so August hung his elbow around the
                        top of the bay horse&apos;s hames, and talked to Julia.</p>
                    <p>It is the highest praise of the German heart that it loves flowers and little children; and like
                        a German and like a lover that he was, August began to speak of the anemones and the violets
                        that were already blooming in the corners of the fence. Girls in love are not apt to say any
                        thing very fresh. And Julia only said she thought the flowers seemed happy in the sunlight. In
                        answer to this speech, which seemed to the lover a bit of inspiration, he quoted from Schiller
                        the lines:</p>
                    <p rend="center">&quot;Yet weep, soft children of the Spring;<lb/> The feeling Love alonc can
                        bring<lb/> Have been denied to you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>With the quick and crafty modesty of her sex, Julia evaded <pb id="VAA2341-016" n="17"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2341-3">
                            <p rend="center">A TAKE WITH A PLOWMAN.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2341-017" n="19"/> this very pleasant shaft by saying: &quot;How much you know,
                        August! How do you learn it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And August was pleased, partly because of the compliment, but chiefly because in saying it Julia
                        had brought the sun-bonnet in such a range that he could see the bright eyes and blushing face
                        at the bottom of this <hi rend="i">camera-oscura</hi>. He did not hasten to reply. While the
                        vision lasted he enjoyed the vision. Not until the sun-bonnet dropped did he take up the answer
                        to her question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know much, but what I do know I have learned out of your Uncle
                        Andrew&apos;s books.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you know my Uncle Andrew? What a strange man he is! He never comes here, and we
                        never go there, and my mother never speaks to him, and my father doesn&apos;t often have
                        anything to say to him. And so you have been at his house. They say dogs and birds and squirrels
                        about. But I thought he never let anybody go up-stairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He lets me,&quot; said August, when she had ended her speech and dropped her
                        sun-bonnet again out of the range of his eyes, which, in truth, were too steadfast in their
                        gaze. &quot;I spend many evenings up-stairs.&quot; August had just a trace of German in
                        his idiom.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What makes Uncle Andrew so curious, I wonder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t exactly know. Some say he was treated not just right by a woman when
                        he was a young man. I don&apos;t know. He seems happy. I don&apos;t wonder a man should
                        be curious though when a woman that he loves treats him not just right. Any way, if he loves her
                        with all his heart, as I love Jule Anderson!&quot;</p>
                    <p>These last words came with an effort. And Julia just then <pb id="VAA2341-018" n="20"/>
                        remembered lier errand, and said, &quot;I must hurry,&quot; and, with, a country
                        girl&apos;s agility, she climbed over the fence before August could help her, and gave him
                        another look through her bonnet telescope from the other side, and then hastened on to return
                        the tea, and to tell Mrs. Malcolm that there was to be a Millerite preacher at the school-house
                        on Sunday night. And August found that his horses were quite cool, while he was quite hot. He
                        cleaned mold-board, and swung his plow round, and then, with a &quot;Whoa! haw!&quot;
                        and a pull upon the single line which Western plowmen use to guide their horses, he drew the
                        team into their place, and set himself to watching the turning of the rich, fragrant black
                        earth. And even as he set his plowshare, so he set his purpose to overcome all obstacles, and to
                        marry Julia Anderson. With the same steady, irresistible, onward course would he overcome all
                        that lay between him and the soul that shone out of the face that dwelt in the bottom of the
                        sun-bonnet.</p>
                    <p>From her covert in the elder-bushes Mrs. Anderson had seen the parley, and her cheeks had also
                        grown hot, but from a very different emotion. She had not heard the words. She had seen the
                        loitering girl and the loitering plowboy, and she went back to the house vowing that
                        she&apos;d &quot;teach Jule Anderson how to spend her time talking to a
                        Dutchman.&quot; And yet the more she thought of it, the more she was satisfied that it
                        wasn&apos;t best to &quot;make a fuss&quot; just yet. She might hasten what she
                        wanted to prevent. For though Julia was obedient and mild in word, she was none the less a
                        little stubborn, and in a matter of this sort might take the bit in her teeth.</p>
                    <p>And so Mrs. Anderson had recourse, as usual, to her husband. She knew she could browbeat him. She
                        demanded that <pb id="VAA2341-019" n="21"/> August Wehle should be paid off and discharged. And
                        when Anderson had hesitated, because he feared he could not get into the declaration:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe that you&apos;d care a cent if she did marry a Dutchman!
                        She might as well as to marry some white folks I know.&quot;</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was settled that August was to be quietly discharged at the end of his
                        month, which was Saturday night. Neither he nor Julia must suspect any opposition to their
                        attachment, nor any discovery of it, indeed. This was settled by Mrs. Anderson. She usually
                        settled things. First, she settled upon the course to be pursued. Then she settled her husband.
                        He always made a show of resistance. His dignity required a show of resistance. But it was only
                        a show. He always meant to surrender in the end. Whenever his wife ceased her fire of small-arms
                        and herself hung out the flag of truce, he instantly capituloated, As in every other dispute, so

                        Anderson attacked her husband at all his weak points, and she had learned by heart a catalogue
                        of his weak points. Then, when he was sufficiently galled to be entirely miserable; when she had
                        expressed her regret that she hadn&apos;t married somebody with some heart, and that she had

                        in the end by a <hi rend="i">coup de partie</hi> somewhat in this fashion:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s just the way! Always the way with you men! I suppose I must give up to
                        you as usual. You&apos;ve lorded it over me from the start. I can&apos;t even have the
                        management of my own daughter. But I do think that after I&apos;ve let you have your way in
                        so many things, you might turn off that fellow. You might let me have my way in one little
                        thing, and you <hi rend="i">would</hi> if you cared for me. You know how liable I am to die at
                        any moment of heart-disease, and yet you will prolong this excitement in this way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now, there is nothing a weak man likes so much as to be considered strong, nothing a henpecked
                        man likes so much as to be regaarded a tyrant. If you ever hear a man boast of his determination
                        to rule his own house, you may feel sure that he is subdued. And a henpecked husband always

                        privileges of wompn. Such a man insists on the shadow of authority because he can not have the
                        substance. It is a great satisfaction to him that his wife can never be president, and that she
                        can not make speeches in prayer-meeting. While he retains these badges of superiority, he is
                        still in some sense head of the family.</p>
                    <p>So when Mrs. Anderson loyally reminded her husband that she had always let him have his own way,
                        he believed her because he wanted to, though he could not just at the moment recall the
                        particular instances. And knowing that he must yield, he rather liked to yield as an act of
                        sovereign grace to the poor oppressed wife who begged it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, if you insist on it, of course, I will not refuse you,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2341-022" n="24"/> he said; &quot;and perhaps you are right.&quot; He had
                        yielded in this way almost every day of his married life, and in this way he yielded to the
                        demand that August should be discharged. But he agreed with his wife that Julia should not know
                        anything about it, and that there must be no leave-taking allowed.</p>
                    <p>The very next day Julia sat sewing on the long porch in front of the house. Cynthy Ann was
                        getting dinner in the kitchen at the other end of the hall, and Mrs. Anderson was busy in her
                        usual battle with dirt. She kept the house clean, because it gratified her combativeness and her
                        domineering dising dirt. And so she scrubbed and scolded, and scolded and rhythm. The scolding
                        was the vocal music, the scrubbing an accompaniment. The concordant discord was perfect. Just at
                        the moment I speak of there was a lull in her scolding. The symphonious scrubbing went on as
                        usual. Julia, wishing to divert the next thunder-storm from herself, erected what she imagined
                        might prove a conversational lightniug-rod, by asking a question on a topic foreign to the theme
                        of the last march her mother had played and sung so sweetly with brush and voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, what makes Uncle Andrew so queer?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. He was always queer.&quot; This was spoken in a staccato,
                        snapping-turtle way. But when one has lived all one&apos;s life with a snapping-turtle, one
                        doesn&apos;t mind. Julia did not mind. She was curious to knoe what was the matter with her
                        uncle, Andrew Anderson. So she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve heard that some false woman treated him cruelly; is that so?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-023" n="25"/>
                    <p>Julia aid not see how rod her mother&apos;s face wag, for she was not regarding her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you that?&quot; Julia was so used to hearing her mother speak in an
                        excited way that she hardly noticed the strange tremor in this question.</p>
                    <p>&quot;August.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The symphony ceased in a moment. The scrubbing-brush dropped in the pail of soapsuds. But the
                        vocal storm burst forth with a violence that startled even Julia. &quot;August said <hi
                            rend="i">that</hi>, did he? And you listened, did you? You listened to <hi rend="i"
                        >that</hi>? <hi rend="i">You</hi> listened to that? <hi rend="i">You listened to that?</hi> Hey?
                        He slandered your mother. You listened to him slander your mother!&quot; By this time Mrs.
                        Anderson was at white heat. Julia was speechless. &quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> saw you
                        yesterday flirting with that <hi rend="i">Dutchman,</hi> and listening to his abouse of your
                        mother! And now you <hi rend="i">insult</hi> me! Well, to-morrow will bo the last day that that
                        Dutchman will hold a plow on this place. And you&apos;d better look out for yourself, miss!
                        You&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here followed a volley of epithets which Julia received standing. But when her mother&apos;s
                        voice grew to a scream, Julia took the word.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mother, hush!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the first word of resistance she had ever uttered. The agony within must have been
                        terrible to have wrung it from her. The mother was stunned with anger and astonishment. She
                        could not recover herself enough to speak until Jule had fled half-way up the stairs. Then her
                        mother covered her pudent hussy! You know I am liable to die of heart-disease any minute, and
                        you want to kill me!&quot;</p>

                    <p>R<hi rend="sc">S. ANDERSON</hi> felt that she had made a mistake. She had not meant to tell Julia
                        that August was to leave. But now that this stormy scene had taken place, she thought she could
                        make a good use of it. She knew that her husband co-operated with her in her opposition to
                        &quot;the Dutchman,&quot; only because he was afraid of his wife. In his heart, Samuel
                        Anderson could not refuse anything to his daughter. Denied any of the happiness which most men
                        find in loving their wives, he found consolation in the love of his daughter. Secretly, as for a
                        loving daughter than for a shrewish wife. She watched him jealously, and had come to regard her
                        daughter as one who had supplanted her in her husband&apos;s affections, and her husband as
                        robbing her of the love of her daughter. In truth, Mrs. Samuel Anderson had come to stand so
                        perpetually on guard against imaginary encroachments on her rights, that she saw <pb
                            id="VAA2341-025" n="27"/> enemies everywhere. She hated Wehle because he was a Dutchman; she
                        would have hated him on a dozen other scores if he had been an American. It was offense enough
                        that Julia loved him.</p>
                    <p>So now she resolved to gain her husband to her side by her version of the story, and before
                        dinner she had told him how August had charged her with being false and cruel to Andrew many
                        years ago, and how Jule had thrown it up to her, and how near she had come to dropping down with
                        palpitation of the heart. And Samuel Anderson reddened, and declared that he would protect his
                        wife from such insults. The notion that he protected his wife was a pleasant fiction of the
                        little man&apos;s, which received a generous encouragement at the hands of his wife. It was
                        a favorite trick of hers to throw herself, in a metaphorical way, at his feet, a helpless woman,
                        and in her feebleness implore bis protection. And Samuel felt all the courage of knighthood in
                        defending bis inoffensive wife. Under cover of this fiction, so flattering to the vanity of an
                        overawed husband, she had managed at one time or another to embroil him with almost all the
                        neighbors, and his refusal to join fences had resulted in that crooked arrangement known as a
                        &quot;devil&apos;s lane&quot; on three sides of his farm.</p>
                    <p>Julia dared not stay away from dinner, which was miserable enough. She did not venture so much as
                        to look at August, who sat opposite her, and who was the most unhappy person at the table,
                        because he did not know what all the unhap-Anderson&apos;s face was full of an earthquake,
                        Cynthy Ann was sitting in shadow, and Julia&apos;s countenance perplexed him.
                        &quot;Whether she was angry with him or not, he could not be sure. <pb id="VAA2341-026"
                            n="28"/> Of one thing he was certain: she was suffering a great deal, and that was enough to
                        make him exceedingly unhappy.</p>
                    <p>Sitting through his hurried meal in this atmosphere surcharged with domestic electricity, he got
                        the notionhe could hardly tell howthat all this lowering of the sky had something to do with
                        him. What had he done? Nothing. His closest self-examination told him that he had done no wrong.
                        But his spirits were depressed, and his sensitive conscience condemned him for some unknown
                        crime that had brought about all this disturbance of the elements. The ham did not seem very
                        good, the cabbage he could not eat, the corn-dodger choked him, he had no desire to wait for the
                        pie. He abridged his meal, and went out to the bam to keep company with his horses and his
                        misery until it should be time to return to his plow.</p>
                    <p>Julia sat and sewed in that tedious afternoon. She would have liked one more interview with
                        August before his departure. Looking through the open hall, she saw him leave the barn and go
                        toward his plowing. Not that she looked up. Hawk never watched chicken more closely than Mrs.
                        Anderson watched poor Jule. But out of the corners of her eyes Julia saw him drive his horses
                        before him from the stable. As the field in which he worked was on the other side of the house
                        from where she sat she could not so much as catch a glimpse of him as he held his plow on its
                        steady course. She wished she might have helped Cynthy Ann in the kitchen, for then she could
                        have seen him, but there was no chance for such a transfer.</p>
                    <p>Thus the tedious afternoon wore away, and just as the sun was settling down so that the shadow of
                        the elm in the frontyard stretched across the road into the cow-pasture, the dead silence was
                        broken. Julia had been wishing that somebody <pb id="VAA2341-027" n="29"/> would speak. Her
                        mother&apos;s sulky speechlessness was worse than her scolding, and Julia had even wished
                        her to resume her storming. But the silence was broken by Cynthy Ann, who came into the hall and
                        called, &quot;Jule, I wish you would go to the barn and gether the eggs; I want to make some
                        cake.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Every evening of her life Julia gathered the eggs, and there was nothing uncommon in Cynthy
                        Ann&apos;s making cake, so that nothing could be more innocent than this request. Julia sat
                        opposite the front-door, her mother sat farther along. Julia could see the face of Cynthy Ann.
                        Her mother could only hear the voice, which was dry and commonplace enough. Julia thought she
                        detected something peculiar in Cynthy&apos;s manner. She would as soon have thought of the
                        big oak gate-posts with their round ball-like heads telegraphing her in a sly way, as to have
                        suspected any such craft on the part of Cynthy Ann, who was a good, pious, simple-hearted,
                        Methodist old maid, strict with herself, and censorious toward others. But there stood Cynthy
                        making some sort of gesture, which Julia took to mean that she was to go quick. She did not dare
                        to show any eagerness. She laid down her work, and moved away listlessly. And evidently she had
                        been too slow. For if August had been in sight when Cynthy Ann called her, he had now
                        disappeared on the other side of the hill. She loitered along, hoping that he would come in
                        sight, but he did not, and then she almost smiled to think how foolish she had been in imagining
                        that Cynthy Ann had any interest in her love affair. Doubtless Cynthy sided with her mother.</p>
                    <p>And so she climbed from mow to mow gathering the eggs. No place is sewwter than a mow, no
                        occupation can be more delightful than gathering the fresh eggsgreat glorious pearls, <pb
                            id="VAA2341-028" n="30"/> more beautiful than any that men dive for, despised only because
                        they are so common and so useful! But Julia, gliding about noiselessly, did not think much of
                        the eggs, did not give much attention to the hens scratching for wheat kernels amongst the
                        straw, nor to the barn swallows chattering over the adobe dwellings which they were building
                        among the rafters above her. She had often listened to the love-talk of these last, but now her
                        heart was too heavy to hear. She slid down to the edge of one of the mows, and sat there a few
                        feet above the threshing-floor with her bonnet in her hand, looking off sadly and vacantly. It
                        was pleasant to sit here alone and think, without the feeling that her mother was penetrating
                        her thoughts.</p>
                    <p>A little rustle brought her to consciousness. Her face was fiery red in a minute. There, in one
                        corner of the threshing-floor, stood August, gazing at her. He had come into the barn to find a
                        single-tree in place of one which had broken. &quot;While he was looking for it, Julia had
                        come, and he had stood and looked, unable to decide whether to speak or not, uncertain how
                        deeply she might be offended, since she had never once let her eyes rest on him at dinner. And
                        when she had come to the edge of the mow and stopped there in a reverie, August had been utterly
                        spell-bound.</p>
                    <p>A minute she blushed. Then, perceiving her opportunity, she dropped herself to the floor and
                        walked up to August.</p>
                    <p>&quot;August, you are to be turned off to-morrow night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What have I done? Anything wrong?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do they send me away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Becausebecause&quot; Julia stopped.</p>
                    <p>But silence is often better than speech. A sudden intelligence <pb id="VAA2341-029" n="31"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2341-4">

                        <pb id="VAA2341-030" n="33"/> came into the blue eyes of August. &quot;They turn me off
                        because I love Jule Anderson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia blushed just a little.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will love her all the same when I am gone. I will always love her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not know what to say to this passionate speech, so she contented herself with looking a
                        little grateful and very foolish.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I am only a poor boy, and a Dutchman at that &quot;he said this

                        was down, and her voice could hardly be heard. &quot;Good-by.&quot; She stretched out
                        her hand, and he took it trembling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; He dropped the hand, and taking a pencil wrote on a beam:</p>
                    <p>&quot;March 18th, 1843.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There, that&apos;s to remember the Dutchman by.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t call yourself a Dutchman, August. One day in school, when I was sitting
                        opposite to you, I learned this definition, &apos; August: grand, magnificent,&apos; and
                        I looked at you and said, Yes, that he is. August is grand and magnificent, and that&apos;s
                        what you are. You&apos;re just grand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>I do not think he was to blame. I am sure he was not responsible. It was done so quickly. He
                        kissed her forehead and then her lips, and said good-by and was gone. And she, with her apron
                        full of eggs and her cheeks very redit makes one warm to climbwent back to the house, resolved
                        in some way to thank Cyntny Ann for sending her; but Cynthy Ann&apos;s <pb id="VAA2341-031"
                            n="34"/> face was so serious and austere in its look that Julia concluded she must have been
                        mistaken, Cynthy Ann couldn&apos;t have known that August was in the barn. For all she said
                        was:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You got a right smart lot of eggs, didn&apos;t you? The hens is beginnin&apos;

                    <p>All the way home from Anderson&apos;s on that Saturday night, August had been, in
                        imagination, listening to the rough voice of his honest father asking this question, and he had
                        been trying to find a satisfactory answer to it. He might say that Mr. Anderson did not want to
                        keep a hand any longer. But that would not be true. And a young man with August&apos;s clear
                        blue eyes was not likely to lie.</p>

                    <p>All this time August found that it was getting harder and harder to tell his father the real
                        state of the case. But the old man, seeing that he prevailed nothing, took a cajoling tone.</p>

                    <p>August&apos;s countenance brightened. All the way home he had felt that it was somehow an
                        unpardonable sin to be a Dutchman. Anderson bad spoken hardly to him in dismissing him, and now
                        it was a great comfort to find that his father returned the contempt of the Yankees at its full
                        value. All the conceit question which was the most disgraced, he or Julia, by their little love
                        affair.</p>
                    <p>But more comforting still was the quiet look of his sweet-faced mother, who, moving about among
                        her throng of children like a hen with more chickens than she can hover,<ref id="ref_001"
                            rend="super" target="note_001" targOrder="U">*</ref> never forgot to be patient and
                        affectionate. If there had been a look of reproach on the face of the mother, it would have been
                        the hardest trial of all. But there was that in her eyesthe dear Moravian motherthat gave
                        courage to August. The mother was an outside conscience, and now as Gottlieb, who had lapsed <pb
                            id="VAA2341-035" n="38"/> into German for his wife&apos;s benefit, rattled on his
                        denunciation of this Canaanitisn Yankee, with whom his son was in love, the son looked every now
                        and then into the eyes, the still German eyes of the mother, and rejoiced that he saw there no
                        reflection of his father&apos;s rebuke. The older Wehle presently resumed his English, such
                        as it was, as better adapted to scolding. Whether he thought to make his children love German by
                        abusing them in English, I do not know, but it was his habit.<note id="note_001"

                    <head type="subtitle">AT THE CASTLE.</head>
                    <p>B<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> the time August reached Andrew Anderson&apos;s castle it was dark. The
                        castle was built in a hollow, looking out toward the Ohio River, a river that has this
                        peculiarity, that it is all beautiful, from Pittsburgh to Cairo. Through the trees, on which the
                        buds were just bursting, August looked out on the golden roadway made by the moonbeams on the
                        river. And into the tumult of his feelings there came the sweet benediction of Nature. And what
                        is Nature but the voice of God?</p>
                    <p>Anderson&apos;s castle was a large log building of strange construction. Everything about it
                        had been built by the hands of Andrew, at once its lord and its architect. Evidently a whimsical
                        fancy had pleased itself in the construction. It was an attempt to realize something of medieval
                        form in logs. There were buttresses and antique windows, and by an ingenious transformation the
                        chimney, usually such a disfigurement to a loghouse, was made to look like a round donjon keep.
                        But it was strangely composite, and I am afraid Mr. Ruskin would have considered it somewhat
                        confused; for while it looked like a <pb id="VAA2341-037" n="40"/> rude castle to those who
                        approached it from the hills, it looked like something very different to those who approached
                        the front, for upon that side was a portico with massive Doric columns, which were nothing more
                        nor less than maple logs. Andrew maintained that the natural from of the trunk of a tree was the
                        ideal and perfect form of a pillar.</p>
                    <p>To this picturesque structure, half castle, half cabin, with hints of church and temple, came
                        August Wchle on Saturday evening. He did not go round to the portico and knock at the front-door
                        as a stranger would have done, but in behind the donjon chimney he pulled an alarm-cord.
                        Immediately the head of Andrew Anderson was thrust out of a Gothic hole you could not call it a
                        window. His uncut hair, rather darker than auburn, fell down to his waist, and his shaggy red
                        beard lay upon his bosom. Instead of a coat he wore that unique garment of linsey-woolsey known
                        in the West as wa&apos;mus (warm us?), a sort of over-shirt. He was forty-five, but there
                        were streaks of gray in his hair and beard, and he looked older by ten years.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What ho, good friend? Is that you?&quot; he cried. &quot;Come up, and right
                        welcome!&quot; For his language was as archaic and perhaps as incongruous as his
                        architecture. And then throwing out of the window a rope-ladder, he called out again,
                        &quot;Ascend! ascend! my brave young friend!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And young Wehle climbed up the ladder into the large tipper room. For it was one peculiarity of
                        the castle that the upper part had no visible communication with the lower. Except August, and
                        now and then a literary stranger, no one but the owner was ever admitted to the upper story of
                        the house, and the neighbors, who always had access to the lower rooms, regarded <pb
                            id="VAA2341-038" n="41"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2341-6">
                            <p rend="center">THE CASTLE.</p>
                        </figure>
                        <pb id="VAA2341-039" n="43"/> the upper part of the castle with mysterious awe. August was often
                        plied with questions about it, but he always answered simply that he didn&apos;t think Mr.
                        Anderson would like to have it talked about. For the owner there must have been some inside mode
                        of access to the second story, but he did not choose to let even August know of any other way
                        than that by the rope-ladder, and the few strangers who came to see his books were taken in by
                        the same drawbridge.</p>
                    <p>The room was filled with booka arranged after whimsical associations. One set of cases, for
                        instance, was called the Academy, and into these he only admitted the masters, following the
                        guidance of his own eccentric judgment quite as much as he followed traditional estimate. Homer,
                        Virgil, Dante, and Milton of course had undisputed possession of the department devoted to the
                        &quot;Kings of Epic,&quot; as he styled them. Sophocles, Calderon, Corneille, and
                        Shakespeare were all that he admitted to his list of &quot;Kings of Tragedy.&quot; Lope
                        he rejected on literary grounds, and Goethe because he thought his moral tendency bad. He
                        rejected Rabelais from his chief humorists, but accepted Cervantes, Le Sage, Moliere, Swift,
                        Hood, and the then fresh Pickwick of Boz. To these he added the Georgia Scenes of Mr.
                        Longstreet, insisting that they were quite equal to Don Quixote. I can only stop to mention one
                        other department in his Academy. One case was devoted to the &quot;Best Stories,&quot;
                        and an admirable set they were! I wish that anything of mine were worthy to go into such
                        company. His purity of feeling, almost ascetic, led him to reject Boccaccio, but he admitted
                        Chaucer and some of Balzac&apos;s, and Smollett, Goldsmith, and De Foe, and Walter
                        Scott&apos;s best, Irving&apos;s Rip Van Winkle, Bernardin St. Pierre&apos;s
                        &quot;Paul and Virginia,&quot; and &apos;&apos; Three Months <pb
                            id="VAA2341-040" n="44"/> under the Snow,&quot; and Charles Lamb&apos;s generally
                        overlooked &quot;Rosamund Gray.&quot; There were cases for &quot;Socrates and his
                        Friends,&quot; and for other classes. He had amused himself for years in deciding what books
                        should be &quot;crowned,&quot; as ho called it, and what not. And then he had another
                        case, called &quot;The Inferno.&quot; I wish there was space to give a list of this
                        department. Some were damned for dullness and some for coarseness. Miss Edgeworth&apos;s
                        Moral Tales, Darwin&apos;s Botanic Garden, Rollin&apos;s Ancient History, and a
                        hideously illustrated copy of the Book of Martyrs were in the first-class, Don Juan and some
                        French novels in the second. Tupper, Swinburne, and Walt Whitman he did not know.</p>
                    <p>In the corner next the donjon chimney was a little room with a small fireplace. Thus the hermit
                        economized wood, for wood meant time, and time meant communication with his books. All of his
                        domestic arrangements were carried on after this frugal fashion. In the little room was a
                        writing-desk, covered with manuscripts and commonplace books.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, my young friend, you&apos;re thrice welcome,&quot; said Andrew, who never
                        dropped his book language. &quot;What will you have? Will you resume your apprenticeship
                        under Goethe, or shall we canter to Canterbury with Chaucer? Grand old Dan Chaucer! Or, shall we
                        study magical philosophy with Roger Baconthe Friar, the Admirable Doctor? or read good Sir
                        Thomas More? What would Sir Thomas have said if he could have thought that he would be admired
                        by two such people as you and I, in the woods of America, in the nineteenth century? But you do
                        not want books! Ah! my brave friend, you are not well. Come into my cell and let us talk. What
                        grieves you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Andrew took him by the hand with the courtesy of a <pb id="VAA2341-041" n="45"/> knight, with
                        the tenderness of a woman, and with the air of an astrologer, and led him into the apartment of
                        a monk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See! &quot;he said,&quot; I have made a new chair. It is the highest <figure
                            entity="VAA2341-7">

                        </figure> evidence of my love for my Teutonic friend. Yon have now a right to this castle. You
                        shall be perpetually welcome. I said to myself, German scholarship shall sit there, and the <pb
                            id="VAA2341-042" n="46"/> Backwoods Philosopher will sit here. So sit down on my <hi
                            rend="i">sedilium</hi>, and let us hear how this uncivil and inconstant world treats you. It
                        can not deal worse with you than it has with me. But I have had my revenge on it! I have been
                        revenged! I have done as I pleased, and defied the world and all its hollow
                        conventionalities.&quot; These last words were spoken in a tone of misanthropic bitterness
                        common to Andrew. His love for August was the more intense that it stood upon a background of
                        general dislike, if not for the world, at least for that portion of it which most immediately
                        surrounded him.</p>
                    <p>August took the chair, ingeniously woven and built of rye straw and hickory splints. He knew that
                        all this formality and apparent pedantry was superficial. He and Andrew were bosom friends, and
                        as he had often opened his heart to the master of the castle before, so now he had no difficulty
                        in telling him his troubles, scarcely heeding the appropriate quotations which Andrew made from
                        time to time by way of embellishment.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE BACKWOODS PHILOSOPHER.</head>
                    <p>O<hi rend="sc">NE</hi> reason for Andrew&apos;s love of August Wehle was that he was a
                        German. Far from sharing in the prejudices of his neighbors against foreigners, Andrew had so
                        thorough a contempt for his neighbors, that he liked anybody who did not belong to his own
                        people. If a Turk had emigrated to Clark township, Andrew would have fallen in love with him,
                        and built a divan for his special accommodation. But ho loved August also for the sake of his
                        gentle temper and his genuine love for books. And only August or August&apos;s mother, upon
                        whom Andrew sometimes called, could exorcise his demon of misanthropy, which he had nursed so
                        long that it was now hard to dismiss it.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Anderson belonged to a class noticed, I doubt not, by every acute observer of provincial
                        life in this country. In backwoods and out-of-the-way communities literary culture produces
                        marked eccentricities in the life. Your bookish man at the West has never learned to mark the
                        distinction between <pb id="VAA2341-044" n="48"/> the world of ideas and the world of practical
                        life. Instead of writing poems or romances, he falls to living them, or at least trying to. Add
                        a disappointment in love, and you will surely throw him into the class of which Anderson was the
                        representative. For the education one gets from books is sadly one-sided, unless it be balanced
                        by a knowledge of the world.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Anderson had always been regarded as an oddity. A man with a good share of ideality and
                        literary taste, placed against the dull background of the society of a Western neighborhood in
                        the former half of the century, would necessarily appear odd. Had he drifted into communities of
                        more culture, his eccentricity, begotten of a sense of superiority to his surroundings, would
                        have worn away. Had he been happily married, his oddities would have been softened; but neither
                        of these things happened. He told August a very different history. For the confidence of his
                        &quot;Teutonic friend&quot; had awakened in the solitary man a desire to uncover that
                        story which he had kept under lock and key for so many years.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah! my friend,&quot; said he with excitement, &quot;don&apos;t trust the
                        faith of a woman.&quot; And then rising from his seat he said, &quot;The Backwoods
                        Philosopher warns you. I pray you give good heed. I do not know Julia. She is my niece. It ill
                        becomes me to doubt her sincerity. But I know whose daughter she is. I pray you give good heed,
                        my Teutonic friend. <hi rend="i">I know whose daughter she is!</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not talk much. But you have arrived at a critical pointa point of turning. Out of
                        his own life, out of his own sorrow, the Backwoods Philosopher warns you. I am at peace now. But
                        look at me. Do you not see the marks of the ravages of a great storm? A sort of a qualified
                        happiness I <pb id="VAA2341-045" n="49"/>
                        <figure entity="VAA2341-8">
                            <p rend="center">&quot;LOOK AT ME&quot;</p>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-046" n="51"/> have in philosophy. But what I might have been if the storm had
                        not torn me to pieces in my youthwhat I might have been, that I am not. I pray you never trust
                        in a woman&apos;s keeping the happiness of your life!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here Andrew slipped his arm through Wehle&apos;s, and began to promenade with him in the
                        large apartment up and down an alley, dimly lighted by a candle, between solid phalanxes of
                        books.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I pray you give good heed,&quot; he said, resuming. &quot;I was always
                        eccentric. People thought I was either a genius or fool. Perhaps I was much of both. But this is
                        a digression. I did not pay any attention to women. I shunned them. I said that to be a great
                        author and a philosophical thinker, one must not be a man of society. I never went to a
                        wood-chopping, to an apple-peeling, to a corn-shucking, to a barn-raising, nor indeed to any of
                        our rustic feasts. I suppose this piqued the vanity of the girls, and they set themselves to
                        catch me. I suppose they thought that I would be a trophy worth boasting. I have noticed that
                        hunters estimate game according to the difficulty of getting it. But this is a digression. Let
                        us return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There came among us, at that time, Abigail Norman. She was pretty. I swear by all the
                        sacred cats of Egypt, that she was beautiful. She was industrious. The best housekeeper in the
                        state! She was high-strung. I liked her all the more for a tragedy queen. But this is a
                        digression. Let us return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She spread her toils in my path. &quot;While I was wandering through the woods
                        writing poetry to birds and squirrels, Abby Norman was ambitious enough to hope to make me her
                        slave, and she did. She read books that she thought I liked. She <pb id="VAA2341-047" n="52"/>
                        planned in various ways to seem to like what I liked, and yet she had sense enough to differ a
                        little from me, and so make herself the more interesting. I think a man of real intellect never
                        likes to have a man or woman agree with him entirely. But let us return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I loved Abigail desperately. No, I did not love Abigail Norman at all. I did not love
                        her as she was, but I loved her as she seemed to my imagination to be. I think most lovers love
                        an ideal that hovers in the air a little above the real recipient of their love. And I think we
                        men of genius and imagination are apt to love something very different from the real person,
                        which is unfortunate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I am digressing again. To return: I wrote poetry to Abby. I courted her. I cut off
                        my long hair for a woman, like Samson. I tried to dress more decently, and made myself
                        ridiculous no doubt, for a man can not dress well unless he has a talent for it. And I never had
                        a genius for beau-knots.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But pardon the digression. Let us return. I was to have married her. The day was set.
                        Then I found accidentally that she was engaged to my brother Samuel, a young man with better
                        manners than mind. She made him believe that she was only making a butt of me. But I think she
                        really loved me more than she knew. When I had discovered her treachery, I shipped on the first
                        flat-boat. I came near committiug suicide, and should have jumped into the river one night, only
                        that I thought it might flatter her vanity. I came back here and ignored her. She broke with
                        Samuel and tried to regain my affections. I scorned her. I trod on her heart! I stamped her
                        pride into insane. Then she went back to Samuel, and <hi rend="i">made</hi> him marry <pb
                            id="VAA2341-048" n="53"/> her. Then she forced my imbecile old father, on his death-bed, to
                        will all the property to Samuel, except this piece of rough hill-land and one thousand dollars.
                        But here I built this castle. My thousand dollars I put in books. I learned how to weave the
                        coverlets of which our country people are so fond, and by this means, and by selling wood to the
                        steamboats, I have made a living and bought my library without having to work by all the arms of
                        Vishnu she should never say that she had driven me away. I don&apos;t know anything about
                        Julia. But I know whose daughter she is. My young friend, beware! I pray you take good heed! The
                        Backwoods Philosopher warns you!&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">WITHIN AND WITHOUT.</head>
                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">F</hi> the gentleman is not born in a man, it can not be bred in him. If it is
                        born in him, it can not be bred out of him. August Wehle had inherited from his mother the
                        instinct of true gentlemanliness. And now, when Andrew relapsed into silence and abstraction, he
                        did not attempt to rouse him, but bidding him goodnight, with his own hands threw the
                        rope-ladder out the window and started up the hollow toward home. The air was sultry and
                        oppressive, the moon had been engulfed, and the first thunder-cloud of the spring was pushing
                        itself up toward the zenith, while the boughs of the trees were quivering with a premonitory
                        shudder. But August did not hasten. The real storm was within. Andrew&apos;s story had
                        raised doubts. When he went down the ravine the love of Julia Anderson shone upon his heart as
                        benignly as the moon upon the waters. Now the light was gone, and the black cloud of a doubt had
                        shut out his peace. Jule Anderson&apos;s father was rich. He had not thought of it before!
                        But now he remembered how much woodland he <pb id="VAA2341-050" n="55"/> owned and how he had
                        two large farms. Jule Anderson would not marry a poor boy. And a Dutchman! She was not sincere.
                        She was trifling with him and teasing her parents. Or, if she were sincere now, she would not be
                        faithful to him against every tempting offer. And he would have to drive on the rocks, too, as
                        Andrew had. At any rate, he would not marry her until he stood upon some sort of equality with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The wind was swaying him about in its fitful gusts, and he rather liked it. In his anguish of
                        spirit it was a pleasure to contend with the storm. The wind, the lightning, the sudden sharp
                        claps of thunder were on his own key. He felt in the temper of old Lear. The winds might blow
                        and crack their cheeks.</p>
                    <p>But it was not alone the suggestions of Andrew that aroused his suspicions. He now recalled a
                        strange statement that Samuel Anderson made in discharging him. &quot;You said what you had
                        no right to say about my wife, in talking to Julia.&quot; What had he said? Only that some
                        woman had not treated Andrew &quot;just right.&quot; Who the woman might be he had not
                        known until his present interview with Andrew. Had Julia been making mischief herself by
                        repeating his words and giving them a direction he had not intended? He could not have dreamed
                        of her acting such a part but for the strange influence of Andrew&apos;s strange story. And
                        so be staggered on, wet to the skin, defying in his heart the lightning and the wind, until he
                        came to the cabin of his father. Climbing the fence, for there was no gate, he pulled the
                        latch-string and entered. They were all asleep; the hard-working family went to bed early. But
                        chubby-faced Wilhelmina, the favorite sister, had set up to wait for August, and he now found
                        her fast asleep in the chair.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-051" n="56"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wilhelmina! wake up!&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O August!&quot; she said, opening the corner of one eye and yawning, &quot;I
                        wasn&apos;t asleep. I onlyahshut my eyes a minute. How wet you are! Did you go to see the
                        pretty girl up at Mr. Anderson&apos;s?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said August.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O August! she is pretty, and she is good and sweet,&quot; and Wilhelmina took his
                        wet cheeks between her chubby hands and gave him a sleepy kiss, and then crept off to bed.</p>
                    <p>And, somehow, the faith of the child Wilhelmina counter-acted the skepticism of the man Andrew,
                        and August felt the storm subsiding.</p>
                    <p>When he looked out of the window of the loft in which he slept the shower had ceased as suddenly
                        as it had come, the thunder had retreated behind the hills, the clouds were already breaking,
                        and the white face of the moon was peering through the ragged rifts.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">GGERS</hi> won&apos;t lie,&quot; said Elder Hankins, the Milleritc
                        preacher. &quot;I say figgers won&apos;t lie. When a Methodis&apos; talks about
                        fallin&apos; from grace he has to argy the pint. And argyments can&apos;t be depended
                        &apos;pon. And when a Prisbyterian talks about parseverance he haint got the absolute
                        sartainty on his side. But figgers won&apos;t lie noways, and it&apos;s figgers that
                        shows this yer to be the last yer of the world, and that the final cend of all things is
                        approach in&apos;. I don&apos;t ask you to listen to no &apos;mpressions of me own,
                        to no reasonin&apos; of nobody; all I ask is that you should listen to the voice of the man
                        in the linen-coat what spoke to Dan&apos;el, and then listen to the voice of the
                        &apos;rithmetic, and to a sum in simple addition, the simplest sort of addition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All the Millerite preachers of that day were not quite so illiterate as Elder Hankins, and it is
                        but fair to say that the Adventists of to-day are a very respectable denomination, doing a work
                        which deserves more recognition from others than it receives. <pb id="VAA2341-053" n="58"/> And
                        for the delusion which expects the world to come to an end immediately, the Adventist leaders
                        are not responsible in the first place. From Gnosticism to Mormonism, every religious delusion
                        has grown from some fundamental error in the previous religious teaching of the people. By the
                        narrowly verbal method of reading the Scripture, so much in vogue in the polemical discussions
                        of the past generation, and still so fervently adhered to by many people, the ground was
                        prepared for Millerism. And to-day in many regions the soil is made fallow for the nest
                        fanaticism. It is only a question of who shall first sow and reap. To people educated as those
                        who gathered in Sugar Grove school-house had been to destroy the spirit of the Scripture by
                        distorting the letter in proving their own sect right, nothing could be so overwhelming as Elder
                        Hankins&apos;s &quot;figgers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>For he had clearly studied figgers to the neglect of the other branches of a liberal education.
                        His demonstration was printed on a large chart. He began with the seventy weeks of Daniel, he
                        added in the &quot;time and times and a half,&quot; and what Daniel declared that he
                        &quot;understood not when he heard,&quot; was plain sailing to the enlightened and
                        mathematical mind of Elder Hankins. When he came to the thousand two hundred and ninety days, he
                        waxed more exultant than Kepler in his supreme moment, and on the thousand three hundred and
                        five and thirty days he did what Jonas Harrison called &quot;the blamedest tallest
                        cipherin&apos; he&apos;d ever seed in all his boro days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jonas was the new hired man, who had stepped into the shoes of August at Samuel
                        Anderson&apos;s. He sat by August and kept up a running commentary, in a loud whisper, on
                        the sermon, &quot;My feller-citizen,&quot; said Jonas, squeezing August&apos;s arm
                        at a climax of the elder&apos;s discourse, &quot;My feller-citizen, looky thar, <pb

                        nothin&apos; in no time. He&apos;s like the feller that tried to find out the valoo of a
                        fat shoat when wood was two dollars a cord. &apos;Ef I can&apos;t do it by substraction
                        I&apos;ll do it by long-division,&apos; says he. And ef this &apos;rithmetic

                        he&apos;ll do it by multiplyin&apos;. They&apos;s only one answer in his book. Gin

                    <p>Now in all the region round about Sugar Grove school-house there was a great dearth of sensation.
                        The people liked the prospect of the end of the world because it would be a spectacle, something
                        to relieve the fearful monotony of their lives. Funerals and weddings were commonplace, and
                        nothing could have been so interesting to them as the coming of the end of the world, as
                        described by Elder Hankins, unless it had been a firstthat scrupulous people might attend from a
                        laudable desire to see the menagerie!) A murder would have been delightful to the people of
                        Clark township. It would have given them something to think and talk about Into this still pool
                        Elder Hankins threw the vials, the trumpets, the thunders, the beast with ten horns, the
                        he-goat, and all the other apocalyptic symbols understood in an absurdly literal way. The world
                        was to come to an end in the following August. Here was an excitement, something worth living
                        for.</p>
                    <p>All the way to their homes the people disputed learnedly about the &quot;time and times and a
                        half,&quot; about &quot;the seven heads and ten horns,&quot; and the seventh vial.
                        The fierce polemical discussions and the bold sectarian dogmatism of the day had taught them
                        anything but &quot;the modesty of true science,&quot; and now the <pb id="VAA2341-055"
                            n="60"/> unsolvable problems of the centuries were taken out of the hands of puzzled
                        scholars and settled as summarily and positively as the relative merits of
                        &quot;gourd-seed&quot; and &quot;fint&quot; corn. Samuel Anderson had always
                        planted his corn in the &quot;light&quot; of the moon and his potatoes in the
                        &quot;dark&quot; of that orb, had always killed his hogs when the moon was on the
                        increase lest the meat should all go to gravy, and he and his wife had carefully guarded against
                        the carrying of a hoc through the house, for fear &quot;somebody might die.&quot; Now,
                        the preaching of the elder impressed him powerfully. His life had always been not so much a bad
                        one as a cowardly one, and to get into heaven by a sis months&apos; repentance, seemed to
                        him a good transaction. Besides he remembered that there men were never married, and that there,
                        at last, Abigail would no longer have any peculiar right to torture him. Hankins could not have
                        ciphered him into Millerism if his wife had not driven him into it as the easiest means of
                        getting a divorce. No doom in the next world could have alarmed him much, unless it had been the
                        prospect of continuing lord and master of Mrs. Abigail. And as for that oppressed woman, she was
                        simply scared. She was quite unwilling to admit the coming of the world&apos;s end so soon.
                        Having some ugly accounts to settle, she would fain have postponed the payday. Mrs. Anderson
                        might truly have been called a woman who feared Godshe had reason to.</p>
                    <p>And as for August, he would not have cared much if the world had come to an end, if only he could
                        have secured one glance of recognition from the eyes of Julia. But Julia dared not look. The
                        process of cowing her had gone on from childhood, and now she was under a reign of terror. She
                        did not yet know that she could resist her mother. And then she lived in <pb id="VAA2341-056"
                            n="61"/> mortal fear of her mother&apos;s heart-disease. By irritating her she might
                        kill her. This dread of matricide her mother held always over her. In vain she watched for a
                        chance. It did not come. Once, when her mother&apos;s head was turned, she glanced at
                        August. But he was at that moment listening or trying to listen to one of Jonas
                        Harrison&apos;s remarks. And August, who did not understand the circumstances, was only able
                        to account for her apparent coldness on the theory suggested by Andrew&apos;s universal
                        unbelief in women, or by supposing that when she understood his innocent remark about
                        Andrew&apos;s disappointment to refer to her mother, she had taken offense at it. And so,
                        while the rest were debating whether the world would come to an end or not, August had a
                        disconsolate feeling that the end of the world had already come. And it did not make him feel
                        better to have Wilhelmina whisper, &quot;Oh! but she <hi rend="i">is</hi> pretty, that
                        Anderson girla&apos;n&apos;t she, August?&quot;</p>

                    <p>Jonas Harrison was leaning against the well-curb, talking to Cynthy Ann. He&apos;d been down
                        to the store at Brayville, he said, a listenin&apos; to &apos;em discuss Millerism, and
                        seed a new singing-master there. &quot;Could he sing good?&quot; Cynthy asked, rather to
                        prolong the talk than to get information.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sings like an owlingale, I reckon. He&apos;s got more seals to his ministry
                        a-hanging onto his watch-chain than I ever seed. Got a mustache onto the top story of his mouth,
                        somethin&apos; like a tuft of grass on the roof of a ole shed kitchen. Peart? He&apos;s
                        the peartesl-lookin&apos; chap I ever seed. But he a&apos;n&apos;t no

                        a-weightin&apos; hisself down with pewter watchseals, gold-washed, and a cultivating a crap

                        suspicions him. They&apos;s too much hi the git-up fer the come-out. Well, here&apos;s
                        yer health, Cynthy!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And having made this oracular speech and quaffed the hard limestone water, Jonas hung the clean
                        white gourd from which he had been drinking, in its place against the well-curb, and started
                        back to the field, while Cynthy Ann carried her bucket of water into the kitchen, blaming
                        herself for standing so long talking to Jonas. To Cynthy everything pleasant had a flavor of
                        sinfulness.</p>
                    <p>The pail of water was hardly set down in the sink when there came a knock at the door, and Cynthy
                        found standing by it the strapped pantaloons, the &quot;red-top&quot; mustache, the
                        watchseals, <pb id="VAA2341-060" n="66"/> and all the rest that went to make up the new
                        singingmaster. He smiled when he saw her, one of those smiles which are strictly limited to the
                        lower half of the face, and are wholly mechanical, as though certain strings inside were pulled
                        with malice aforethought and the mouth jerked out into a square grin, such as an
                        ingeniously-made automaton might display.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mr. Anderson in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, sir; he&apos;s gone to town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Mrs. Anderson in?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And so he entered, and soon got into conversation with the lady of the house, and despite the
                        prejudice which she entertained for mustaches, she soon came to like him. He smiled so
                        artistically. He talked so fluently. He humored all her whims, pitied all her complaints, and
                        staid to dinner, eating her best preserves with a graciousness that made Mrs. Anderson feel how
                        great was his condescension. For Mr. Humphreys, the singing-master, had looked at the comely
                        face of Julia, and looked over Julia&apos;s shoulders at the broad acres beyond; and he
                        thought that in Clark township he had not met with so fine a landscape, so nice a figure-piece.
                        And with the quick eye of a man of the world, he had measured Mrs. Anderson, and calculated on
                        the ease with which he might complete the picture to suit his taste.</p>
                    <p>He staid to supper. He smiled that same fascinating square smile on Samuel Anderson, treated him
                        as head of the house, talked glibly of farming, and listened better than he talked. He gave no
                        account of himself, except by way of allusion. He would begin a sentence thus, &quot;When I
                        was traveling in France with my poor dear mother,&quot; etc., from which Mrs. Anderson
                        gathered that he had been a devoted son, and then he would <pb id="VAA2341-061" n="67"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-062" n="69"/> relate how he had seen something curious &quot;when he was
                        dining at the house of the American minister at Berlin.&quot; &quot;This hazy air
                        reminds me of my native mountains in Northern New York.&quot; And then he would allude to
                        his study of music in the Conservatory in Leipsic. To plain country people in an out-of-the-way
                        Western neighborhood, in 1843, such a man was better than a lyceum full of lectures. He brought
                        them the odor of foreign travel, the flavor of city, the &quot;otherness&quot; that
                        everybody craves.</p>
                    <p>He staid to dinner, as I have said, and to supper. He staid over night. He took up his board at
                        the house of Samuel Anderson. Who could resist his entreaty? Did he not assure them that he felt
                        the need of a home in a cultivated family? And was it not the one golden opportunity to have the
                        daughter of the house taught music by a private master, and thus give a special <hi rend="i"
                            >eclat</hi> to her education? How Mrs. Anderson hoped that this superior advantage would
                        provoke jealous remarks on the part of her neighbors! It was only necessary to the completion of
                        her triumph that they should say she was &quot;stuck up.&quot; Then, too, to have so
                        brilliant a beau for Julia! A beau with watch-seals and a mustache, a beau who had been to Paris
                        with his mother, studied music in the Conservatory at Leipsic, dined with the American minister
                        in Berlin, and done ever so many more wonderful things, was a prospect to delight the ambitious
                        heart of Mrs. Anderson, especially as he flattered the mother instead of the daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a independent citizen of this Federal Union,&quot; said Jonas to
                        Cynthy, &quot;carries his head like he was intimately &apos;quainted with the
                        &apos;merican eagle hisself. He&apos;s playin&apos; this game sharp. He deals all
                        the trumps to hisself, and most everything <pb id="VAA2341-063" n="70"/> besides. He&apos;ll
                        carry off the gal if something don&apos;t arrest him in his headlong career. Jist let me git
                        a chance at him when he&apos;s soarin&apos; loftiest into the amber blue above, and
                        I&apos;ll cut his kite-string fer him, and let him fall like fork-ed lightnin&apos; into
                        a mud-puddle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Cynthy said she did see one great sin that he had committed for sure. That was the
                        puttin&apos; on of gold and costly apparel. It was sot down in the Bible and in the
                        Methodist Dis<hi rend="i">cip</hi>line that it was a sin to wear gold, and she should think the
                        poor man hadn&apos;t no sort o&apos; regard for his soul, weighing it down with them
                        things.</p>
                    <p>But Jonas only remarked that he guessed his jewelry warn&apos;t no sin. He didn&apos;t

                        Julia in a matter-of-course way, treating her with attention, but taking care not to make
                        himself too attentive. Except that Julia could not endure his smilewhich was, like some joint

                        monotonous life under the eye of her mother, who almost never left her alone, and who cut off

                        Mr. Humphreys, who always interested her witli his adventures. For indeed it really seemed that
                        he had had more adventures than any dozen other men. How should a simple-hearted girl understand
                        him? How should she read the riddle of a life so full of duplicityof <hi rend="i"

                        was a clue which he had not got. <pb id="VAA2341-065" n="72"/> But at last the key dropped into

                        neighbor of the Andersons. The singing-master often saw her at Mr. Anderson&apos;s, and he
                        often wished that Julia were as easy to win as he felt Betsey to be. The sensuous mouth, the
                        giddy eyes of Betsey, showed quickly her appreciation of every flattering attention to paid her,
                        and though in Julia&apos;s presence he was careful how he treated her, yet when he, walking
                        down the road one day, alone, met her, he courted her assiduously. He had not to observe any
                        caution in her case. She greedily absorbed all the flattery he could give, only pettishly
                        responding after a while: &quot;O dear! that&apos;s the way you talk to me, and
                        that&apos;s the way you talk to Jule sometimes, I s&apos;pose. I guess she
                        don&apos;t mind keeping two of you as strings to her bow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Two! &quot;What do you mean, my fair friend? I havn&apos;t seen one,
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no! You mean you havn&apos;t seen two. You see one whenever you look in the
                        glass. The other is a Dutchman, and she&apos;s dying after him. She may flirt with you, but
                        her mother watches her night and day, to keep her from running off with Gus Wehle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like many another crafty person, Betsey Malcolm had fairly overshot the mark. In seeking to
                        separate Humphreys from Julia, she had given him the clue he desired, and he was not slow to use
                        it, for he was almost the only person that Mrs. Anderson trusted alone with Julia.</p>
                    <p>In the dusk of the evening of the very day of his talk with Betsey, he sat on the long
                        front-porch with Julia. Julia liked <pb id="VAA2341-066" n="73"/> him better, or rather did not
                        dislike him so much in the dark as she did in the light. For when it was light she could see him
                        smile, and though she had not learned to connect a coldblooded face with a villainous character,
                        she had that childish instinct which made her shrink from Humphreys&apos;s square smile. It
                        always seemed to her that the real Humphreys gazed at her out of the cold, glittering eyes, and
                        that the smile was something with which he had nothing to do.</p>
                    <p>Sitting thus in the dusk of the evening, and looking out over the green pasture to where the
                        nigher hills ceased and the distant seemed to come immediately after, their distance only
                        indicated by color, though the whole Ohio &quot;bottom&quot; was between, she forgot the
                        Mephistopheles who sat not far away, and dreamed of August, the &quot;grand,&quot; as
                        she fancifully called him. And he let her sit and dream undisturbed for a long time, until the
                        darkness settled down upon the hills. Then he spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;II thought,&quot; began Humphreys, with well-feigned hesitancy, &quot;I
                        thought, I should venture to offer you my assistance as a true and gallant man, in a mattera
                        matter of supreme delicacya matter that I have no right to meddle with. I think I have heard
                        that your mother is not friendly to the suit of a young man whowhowell, let us say who is not
                        wholly disagreeable to you. I beg your pardon, don&apos;t tell me anything that you prefer
                        to keep locked in the privacy of your own bosom. But if I can render any assistance, you know. I
                        have some little influence with your parents, maybe. If I could be the happy bearer of any
                        communications, command me as your obedient servant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not know what to say. To get a word to August was what she most desired. But the
                        thought of using Humphreys <pb id="VAA2341-067" n="74"/> was repulsive to her. She could not see
                        his face in the gathering darkness, but she could <hi rend="i">feel</hi> him smile that same
                        soulless, geometrical smile. She could not do it. She did not know what to say. So she said
                        nothing. Humphreys saw that he must begin farther back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear the young man spoken of as a praiseworthy person. German, I believe? I have
                        always noticed a peculiar manliness about Germans. A peculiar refinement, indeed, and a courtesy
                        that is often wanting in Americans. I noticed this when I was in Leipsic. I don&apos;t think
                        the German girls are quite so refined. German gentlemen in this country seem to prefer American
                        girls oftentimes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>All this might have sounded hollow enough to a disinterested listener. To Julia the words were as
                        sweet as the first rain after a tedious drouth. She had heard complaint, censure, innuendo, and
                        downright abuse of poor Gus. These were the first generous words. They confirmed her judgment,
                        they comforted her heart, they made her feel grateful, even affectionate toward the fop, in
                        spite of his watch-seals, his curled mustache, his straps, his cold eyes, and his artificial
                        smile. Poor fool you will call her, and poor fool she was. For she could have thrown herself at
                        the feet of Humphreys, and thanked him for his words. Thank him she did in a stammering way, and
                        he did not hesitate to repeat his favorable impressions of Germans, after that. What he wanted
                        was, not to break the hold of August until he had placed himself in a position to be next heir
                        to her regard.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> reader must understand that all this time Elder Hankins continued to
                        bombard Clark township with the thunders and lightnings of the Apocalypse, continued to whirl
                        before the dazed imaginations of his rustic hearers the wheels within wheels and the faces of
                        the living creatures of &apos;Zek&apos;el, continued to cipher the world out of
                        existence according to formulas in Dan&apos;el, marched out the he-goat, made the seven
                        heads and ten horns of the beast do service over and over again. And all the sweet mysteries of
                        Oriental imagery, the mystic figures which unexpounded give so noble a depth to the perspective
                        of Scripture, were cut to pieces, pulled apart, and explained as though they were tricks of
                        legerdemain. Julia was powerfully impressed, not by the declamations of Hankins, for she had
                        sensibility enough to recoil from his vivisection of Scripture, though she had been all her life
                        accustomed to hear it from other than Millerites, but she was profoundly affected by the
                        excitement about her. Her father, attracted in part by the promise that there <pb
                            id="VAA2341-069" n="76"/> should be no marrying there, had embraced Millerism with all his
                        heart, and was in such a state of excitement that he could not attend to his business. Mrs.
                        Anderson was in continual trepidation about it, though she tried not to believe it. She was on
                        the point of rebelling and declaring that the world <hi rend="i">should</hi> not come to an end.
                        But on the whole she felt that the governent of the universe was one affair in which she would
                        have to give up all hope of having her own way. Meantime there was no increase of religion. Some
                        were frightened out of their vices for a time, but a passionate terror of that sort is the worst
                        enemy of true piety.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fer my part,&quot; said Cynthy Ann, as she walked home with Jonas, &quot;for my
                        part, I don&apos;t believe none of his nonsense. John Wesley&quot; (Jonas was a
                        New-Light, and Cynthy always talked to him about Wesley) &quot;knowed a heap more about
                        Scripter than all the Hankinses and Millerses that ever was born, and he knowed how to cipher,
                        too, I &apos;low. Why didn&apos;t he say the world was goin&apos; to wind up?
                        An&apos; our persidin&apos; elder is a heap better instructed than Hankins, and he says
                        God don&apos;t tell nobody when the world&apos;s goin&apos; to wind up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Goin&apos; to run down, you mean, Cynthy Ann. &apos;Kordin&apos; to Hankins
                        it&apos;s a old clock gin out in the springs, I &apos;low. How does Hankins know that
                        &apos;Zek&apos;el&apos;s livin&apos; creetera means one thing more&apos;n
                        another? He talks about them wheels as materal as ef he was a wagon-maker fixin&apos; a ole
                        buggy. He says the thing&apos;s a gone tater; no more craps of corn often the bottom land,
                        no more electin&apos; presidents of this free and glorious Columby, no more Fourths, no more
                        shootin&apos; crackers nor spangled banners, no more nothin&apos;. He ciphers and
                        ciphers, and then spits on his slate and wipes ua all out. Whenever Gabr&apos;el <pb
                            id="VAA2341-070" n="77"/> blows I&apos;ll b&apos;lleve it, but I won&apos;t take
                        none o&apos; Hankins&apos;s tootin in place of it. I shan&apos;t git skecred at no
                        tin-horns, and as for papaw whistles, why, I say Jericho wouldn&apos;t a-tumbled for no sech
                        music, and they won&apos;t fetch down no stars that air way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here old Gottlieb Wehle, who had just joined the Millerites, came up. &quot;Yonas, you mags

                    <p>&quot;My venerated friend and feller-citizen of forren birth,&quot; said. Jonas,
                        &quot;you hit the nail on the crown of the head squar, with the biggest sort ov a
                        sledge-hammer. You gripped a-holt of the truth that air time like the American bird
                        a-grippin&apos; the arries on the shield. What do they mean? That&apos;s jest the
                        question, and you Millerites allers argies like the man who warranted his dog to be a good

                        Fer ef they don&apos;t mean 1843, what do they mean? Why, 1842 or 1844, of course. You
                        don&apos;t come no coon-dog argyments over me, not while I remain sound in wind and

                    <p>&quot;The same to yerself, my beloved friend and free and enlightened feller-citizen. Long
                        may you wave, like a green bay hoss, and a jimson-weed on the sunny side of a

                    <p>Gottlieb hurried on, finding Jonas much harder to understand than the prophecies.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear the singing-master is goin&apos; to jine,&quot; said Cynthy Ann.
                        &quot;Wonder ef they&apos;ll take him with all his seals and straps, and hair on his
                        upper lip, with the plain words of the Bible agin gold and costly apparel? &quot;Wonder ef
                        he&apos;s tuck in, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tuck in? He an&apos;t one of that kind. He don&apos;t never git tuck inhe tucks
                        in. He knows which side of his bread&apos;s got quince presarves onto it. I used to run
                        second mate on the Dook of Orleans, and I know his kind. He&apos;ll soar around like a
                        turkey-buzzard fer a while. Presently he&apos;ll light. He&apos;s rusticatin&apos;
                        tell some scrape blows over. An&apos; heapos;ll make somethinapos; outen it. Business afore
                        pleasure is his motto. He don&apos; hang that seducin&apos; grin under them hawky eyes
                        fer nothin&apos;. Wait till the pious and disinterested example &apos;lights somewheres.
                        Then look out for the feathers, won&apos;t ye! He won&apos;t leave nary bone. But here
                        we air. I declare, Cynthy, this walk seems <hi rend="i">the shortest</hi>, when I&apos;m in
                        superfine, number-one comp&apos;ny!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Cynthy was so pleased with this remark, that she did penance in her mind for a week afterwards.
                        It was so wicked to enjoy one&apos;s self out of class-meeting!</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> the singing-school and at the church August waited as impatiently as
                        possible for some sign of recognition from Julia. He little knew the fear that beset her. Having
                        seen her hysterical mother prostrated for weeks by the excitement of a dispute with her father,
                        it seemed to her that if she turned one look of love and longing toward young Wehle, whose sweet
                        German voice rang out above the rest in the hymns, she might kill her mother as quickly as by
                        plunging a knife into her heart. The steam-doctor, who was the family physician, had warned her
                        and her father separately of the danger of exciting Mrs. Anderson&apos;s most excitable
                        temper, and now Julia was the slave of her mother&apos;s disease. That lucky hysteria, which
                        the steam-doctor thought a fearful heart-disease, had given Mrs. Abigail the whip-hand of
                        husband and daughter, and she was not slow to know her advantage, using her heart in a most
                        heartless way.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-073" n="80"/>
                    <p>August could not blame Julia for not writing, for he had tried to break the blockade by a letter
                        sent through Jonas and Cynthy Ann, but the latter had found herself so well watched that the
                        note oppressed her conscience and gave a hangdog look to her face for two weeks before she got
                        it out of her pocket, and then she put it under the pillow of Julia&apos;s bed, and had
                        reason to believe that the suspicious Mrs. Anderson confiscated it within five minutes. For the
                        severity of maternal government was visibly increased thereafter, and Julia received many
                        reminders of her ingratitude and of her determination to kill her self-sacrificing mother by her
                        stubbornness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; Mrs. Anderson would say, &quot;it&apos;s all one to me whether
                        the world comes to an end or not. I should like to live to see the day of judgment. But I
                        shan&apos;t. No affectionate mother can stand such treatment as I receive from my own
                        daughter. If Norman was only at home!&quot;</p>
                    <p>It is proper to explain here that Norman was her son, in whom she took a great deal of comfort
                        when he was away, and whom she would have utterly spoiled by indulgence if he had not been born
                        past spoiling. He was the only person to whom she was indulgent, and she was indulgent to him
                        chiefly because he was so weak of will that there was not much glory in conquering him, and
                        because her indulgence to him was a rod of affliction to the rest of her family.</p>
                    <p>Failing to open communication through Jonas and Cynthy Ann, August found himself in a desperate
                        strait, and with an impatience common to young men he unhappily had recourse to Betsey Malcolm.
                        She often visited Julia, and twice, when Julia was not at meeting, he went home with the
                        ingenuous Betsey, who always pretended to have something to tell him &quot;about <pb
                            id="VAA2341-074" n="81"/> Jule,&quot; and who yet, for the pure love of mischief-making,
                        tried to make him think as poorly as possible of Julia&apos;s sincerity, and who, from pure
                        love of flirtation, puckered her red lips, and flashed at him with her sensuous eyes, and sighed
                        and blushed, or rather flushed, while she sympathized with him in a way that might have been
                        perilous if he had been an American instead of a constant-hearted &quot;Dutchman,&quot;
                        wholly absorbed with the image of Julia. But, so far as carrying messages was concerned, Betsey
                        was certainly a non-conductor. She professed never to be able to run the blockade with any
                        communication of his. She said to herself that she wasn&apos;t going to help Jule Anderson
                        to keep <hi rend="i">all</hi> the beaus. She meant to capture one or the other of them if she
                        could. And, indeed, she did not dream how grievous was the wrong she did. For she could
                        appreciate no other feeling in the matter than vanity, and she could not see any particular harm
                        in &quot;taking Jule Anderson down a peg.&quot; And so she assured the anxious and
                        already suspicious August that if she was in his place she should want that singing-master out
                        of the way. &quot;Some girls can&apos;t stand people that wear jewelry and mustaches and
                        straps and such things. And Mr. Humphreys is very careful of her, won&apos;t let her sit too
                        late on the porch, and is very comforting in his way of talking to her. And she seems to like
                        it. I tell you what it is, Gus&quot;and she looked at him so bewitchingly that the pure and
                        sensitive August blushed, he could hardly tell why&quot; I tell you Jule&apos;s a nice
                        girl, and got a nice property back of her, and I hope she won&apos;t act like her mother.
                        And, indeed, I can&apos;t hardly believe she will, though the way she eyes that Humphreys
                        makes me mad.&quot; She had suggested the old doubt. A doubt is dangerous <pb
                            id="VAA2341-075" n="82"/> when its face grows familiar, and one recognizes the
                        &quot;Monsieur Tonson come again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And all the message the disinterested and benevolent Betsey bore to Julia was to tell her
                        exultingly that Gus had twice walked home with her. And they had had such a nice time! And
                        Julia, girl that she was, declared indignantly that she didn&apos;t care whom he went with;
                        though she did care, and her eyes and face said so. Thus the tongue sometimes liesor seems to
                        liewhen the whole person is telling the truth. The only excuse for the tongue is that it will
                        not be believed, and it knows that it will not be believed! It only speaks diplomatically,
                        maybe. But diplomatic talking is bad. Better the truth. If Jule had known that her words would
                        be reported to August, she would have bitten out her tongue rather than to have let it utter
                        words that were only the cry of her wounded pride. Of course Betsey met August in the road the
                        next morning, in a quiet hollow by the brook, and told him sympathizingly, almost
                        affectionately, that she had begun to talk to Julia about him, and that Jule had said she
                        didn&apos;t care. So while Julia uttered a lie she spoke the truth, and while Betsey uttered
                        the truth she spoke a lie, willful, malicious, and wicked.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the mean time, Julia, on her side, had tried to open communication through the only
                        channel that offered itself. She did not attempt it by means of Betsey, because, being a woman,
                        she felt instinctively that Betsey was not to be trusted. But there was only one other to whom
                        she was allowed to speak, except under a supervision as complete as it was unacknowledged. That
                        other was Mr. Humphreys. He evinced a constant interest in her affairs, avowing that he always
                        did have <pb id="VAA2341-076" n="83"/> &gt;a romantic desire to effect the union of suitable
                        people, even though it might pain his heart a little to see another more fortunate than himself.
                        Julia had given up all hope of communicating by letter, and she could not bring herself to make
                        any confessions to a man who had such a smile and such eyes, but to a generous proposition of
                        Mr. Humphreys that he should see August and open the way for any communication between them, she
                        consented, scarcely concealing her eagerness.</p>
                    <p>August was not in a mood to receive Humphreys kindly. He hated him by intuition, and a liking for
                        him had not been begotten by Betsey&apos;s assurances that he was making headway with Julia.
                        August was riding astride a bag of corn on his way to mill, when Humphreys, taking a walk, met
                        him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A pleasant day, Mr. Wehle!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said August, with a courtesy as mechanical as Humphreys&apos;s
                        smile.</p>
                    <p>The singing-master was rather pleased than otherwise to see that August disliked him. It suited
                        his purpose just now to gall Wehle into saying what he would not otherwise have said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hear you are in trouble,&quot; he proceeded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! I hear that Mrs. Anderson doesn&apos;t like Dutchmen.&quot; The smile now
                        seemed to have something of a sneer in it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know that that is your affair,&quot; said August, all his
                        suspicions, by a sort of &quot;resolution of force,&quot; changing into anger.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! I beg pardon,&quot; with a tone half-mocking. &quot;I did not know but I
                        might help settle matters. I think I have Mrs. Anderson&apos;s confidence, and I know that I
                        have Miss Anderson&apos;s confidence in an unusual degree. I think a great <pb
                            id="VAA2341-077" n="84"/> deal of her. And she thinks me <hi rend="i">her friend</hi> at
                        least. I thought that there might be some little matters yet unsettled between you two, and she
                        suggested that maybe there might be something you would like to say, and that if you would say
                        it to me, it would be all the same as if it were said to her. She considers that in the relation
                        I bear to her and the family, a message delivered to me is the same in effect as if given to
                        her. I told her I did not think you would, as a gentleman, wish to hold her to any promises that
                        might be irksome to her now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These words were spoken with a coolness and maliciousness of good-nature quite devilish, and
                        August&apos;s fist involuntarily doubled itself to strike him, if only to make him cease
                        smiling in that villainous rectangular way. But he checked himself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are a puppy. Tell <hi rend="i">that</hi> to Jule, if you choose. I shall send her a
                        release from all obligations, but not by the hand of a rascal!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like all desperadoes, Humphreys was a coward. He could shoot, but he could not fight, and just
                        now he was affecting the pious or at least the high moral role, and had left his pistols,
                        brandy-flasks, and the other necessary appurtenances of a gentleman, locked in his trunk.
                        Besides it would not at all have suited his purpose to shoot. So in lieu of shooting he only
                        smiled, as August rode off, that same old geometric smile, the elements of which were all
                        calculated. He seemed incapable of any other facial contortion. It expressed one emotion,
                        indeed, about as well as another and was therefore as convenient as those pocket-knives which
                        affect to contain a chest of tools in one.</p>

                    <p>Julia was already stung to jealousy by Betsey Malcolm&apos;s mischief-making, and it did not
                        require much more to put her into a frenzy. As they walked home from meeting the next nightthey
                        had meeting all nights now, the world would soon end and there was so much to be doneas they
                        walked home Humphreys contrived to separate Julia from the rest, and to tell her that he had had
                        a conversation with young Wehle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was painful, very painful,&quot; he said, &quot;I think I had better not say
                        any more about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Julia in terror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I feel that your grief is mine. I have never felt so much interest in any one
                        before, and I must say that I was grievously disappointed. This young man is not at all worthy
                        of you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; And there was a trace of indignation in her tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It does seem to me that the man who has your love should be the happiest in the world;
                        but he refused to send you any message, and says that he will soon send you an entire release
                        from all engagement to him. He showed no tenderness and made no enquiry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The weakest woman and the strongest can faint. It is a woman&apos;s last resort. When all
                        else is gone, that remains. Julia drew a sharp quick breath, and was just about to become
                        unconscious. Humphreys stretched his arms to catch her, but the sudden recollection that in case
                        she fainted he would carry her into the house, produced a reaction. She released herself from
                        his grasp, and hurried in alone, locking her door, and refusing admittance to her mother. From
                            <pb id="VAA2341-080" n="88"/> Humphreys, who had put himself into a delicate minor key, Mrs.
                        Anderson got such an account of the conversation as he thought best to give. She then opened and
                        read a note placed into her hand by a neighbor as she came out from meeting. It was addressed to
                        Julia, and ran:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If all they say is true, you have quickly changed. I do not hold you by any promises
                        you wish to break.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A<hi rend="sc">UGUST</hi> W<hi rend="sc">EHLE</hi>.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson had no pity. She hesitated not an instant. Julia&apos;s door was fast. But she
                        went out upon the front upper porch, and pushing up the window of her daughter&apos;s room
                        as remorselessly as she had committed the burglary on her private letter, she looked at her a
                        moment, sobbing on the bed, and then threw the letter into the room, saying:
                        &quot;It&apos;s good for you. Read that, and see what a fellow your Dutchman
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Then Mrs. Anderson sought her couch, and slept with a serene sense of having done <hi rend="i"
                            >her</hi> duty as a mother, whatever might be the result.</p>

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">ULIA</hi> got up from her bed the moment that her mother had gone. Her first
                        feeling was that her privacy had been shamefully outraged. A true mother should honorably
                        respect the reserve of the little child. But Julia was now a woman, grown, with a
                        woman&apos;s spirit. She rose from her bed, and shut her window with a bang that was meant
                        to be a protest. She then put the tenpenny nail sometimes used to fasten the window down, in its
                        place, as if to say, &quot;Come in, if you can.&quot; Then she pulled out the folds of
                        the chintz curtain, hanging on its draw-string half-way up the window. If there had been any
                        other precaution possible, she would have taken it. But there was not.</p>
                    <p>She took up the note, and read it. Julia was not a girl of keen penetration. Her training was
                        that of a country life. She did not read between the lines of August&apos;s note, and could
                        only understand that she was dismissed. Outraged by her mother&apos;s tyranny, spurned by
                        her lover, she stood like a hunted creature, brought to bay, looking for the last desperate
                        chance for escape.</p>
                    <p>Crushed? No. If she had been weaker, if she had been of the quieter, frailer sort, instead of
                        being, as she was, elastic, impulsive, recuperative, she might have been crushed. She was <pb
                            id="VAA2341-082" n="90"/> wounded in her heart of hearts, but all her pride and hardihood,
                        of which she had not a little, had now taken up arms against outrageous fortune. She was stung
                        at every thought of August and his letter, of Betsey Malcolm and her victory, of the fact that
                        her mother had read the letter and knew of her humiliation. And she paced the floor of her room,
                        and resolved to resist and to be revenged. She would marry anybody, that she might show Betsey
                        and August they had not broken her heart and that her love did not go begging.</p>
                    <p>O Julia! take care. Many another woman has jumped off that precipice!</p>
                    <p>And she would escape from her mother. The indications of affection adroitly given by Humphreys
                        were all remembered now. She could have him, and she would. He would take her to Cincinnati. She
                        would have her revenge all around. I am sorry to show you my heroine in this mood. But the
                        fairest climes are sometimes subject to the fiercest hurricanes, the frightfulest earthquakes!</p>
                    <p>After an hour the room seemed hot. She pulled back the chintz curtain and pushed up the window.
                        The blue-grass in the pasture looked cool as it drank the heavy dews. She climbed through the
                        window on to the long, old-fashioned upper porch. She sat down upon an old-fashioned settee with
                        rockers, and began to rock. The motion relieved her nervousness and fanned her hot cheeks. Yes,
                        she would accept the first respectable lover that offered. She would go to the city with
                        Humphreys, if he asked her. It is only fair to say that Julia did not at all considershe was not
                        in a temper to considerwhat a marriage with Humphreys implied. She only thought of it on two
                        sidesthe revenge upon August and <pb id="VAA2341-083" n="91"/> Betsey, and the escape from a
                        thralldom now grown more bitter than death. True, her conscience was beginning to awaken, and to
                        take up arms against her resolve. But nothing could be plainer. In marrying Mr. Humphreys she
                        should marry a friend, the only friend she had. In marrying him she would <figure
                            entity="VAA2341-12">
                            <p rend="center">TEMPTED.</p>
                        </figure> satisfy her mother, and was it not her duty to sacrifice something to her
                        mother&apos;s happiness, perhaps her mother&apos;s life?</p>
                    <p>Yes, yes, Julia, a false spirit of self-sacrifice is another path over the cliff! In such a mood
                        as this all paths lead into the abyss.</p>
                    <p>Her mind was made up. She braced her will against all <pb id="VAA2341-084" n="92"/> the
                        relentings of her heart. She wished that Humphreys, who had indirectly declared his love so
                        often, were there to offer at once. She would accept him immediately, and then the whole
                        neighborhood should not say that she had been deserted by a Dutchman. For in her anger she found
                        her mother&apos;s epithets expressive.</p>
                    <p>He was there! Was it the devil that planned it? Does he plan all those opportunities for wrong
                        that are so sure to offer themselves? Humphreys, having led a life that turned night into day,
                        sat at the farther end of the long upper porch, smoking his cigar, waiting a bed-time nearer to
                        the one to which he was accustomed.</p>
                    <p>Did he suspect the struggle in the heart of Julia Anderson? Did he guess that her pride and
                        defiance had by this time reached high-water mark? Did he divine this from seeing her there? He
                        rose and started in through the door of the upper hall, the only opening to the porch, except
                        the window. But this was a feint. He turned back and sat himself down upon the farther end of
                        the settee from Julia. He understood human nature perfectly, and had had long practice in making
                        gradual approaches. He begged her pardon for the bungling manner in which he had communicated
                        intelligence that must be so terrible to a heart so sensitive! Julia was just going to declare
                        that she did not care anything for what August said or thought, but her natural truthfulness
                        checked the transparent falsehood. She had not gone far enough astray to lie consciously; she
                        was, as yet, only telling lies to herself. Very gradually and cautiously did he proceed so as
                        not to &quot;flush the bird.&quot; Even as I saw, an hour ago, a cat creep upon a
                        sparrow with fascinating eyes, and a waving, <pb id="VAA2341-085" n="93"/> snake-like motion of
                        the tail, and a treacherous feline smile upon her face, even so, cautiously and by degrees,
                        Humphreys felt his way with velvet paws toward his prey. He knew the opportunity, that once gone
                        might not come again; he soon guessed that this was the hour and power of darkness in the soul
                        of Julia, the hour in which she would seek to flee from her own pride and mortification. And if
                        Humphreys knew how to approach with a soft tread, very slowly and cautiously, he also knewmen of
                        his &quot;profession&quot; always knowwhen to spring. He saw the moment, he made the
                        spring, he seized the prey.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will you trust your destiny to me, Miss Anderson? You seem beset by troubles. I have
                        means. I could not but be wholly devoted to your welfare. Let me help you to flee away fromfrom
                        all this mortification, and thisthis domestic tyranny. Will you intrust yourself to
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not say anything about love. He bad an instinctive feeling that it would not be best. She
                        felt herself environed with insurmountable difficulties, threatened with agonies worse than
                        deathso they seemed to her. He simply, coolly opened the door, and bade her easily and
                        triumphantly escape. Had he said one word of tenderness the reaction must have set in.</p>
                    <p>She was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did hope, by sacrificing all my own hopes, to effect a reconciliation. But when that
                        young man spoke insulting words about you, I determined at once to offer you my devoted
                        protection. I ask no more than you are able to give, your respect. Will you accept my life-long
                        protection as your husband?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said the passionate girl in an agony of despair.</p>

                        knowing what to say, he said nothing, in which he showed his wisdom. But he felt that saying
                        nothing was almost as bad as saying something. And he was right. For with people of impulsive
                        temperament reactions are sudden, and in one minute after Julia had said yes, there came to her
                        memory the vision of August standing in the barn and looking into her eyes so purely and truly
                        and loyally, and vowing such sweet vows of love, and she looked back upon that perfect hour with
                        some such feeling perhaps as Dives felt looking out of torment across the great gulf into
                        paradise. Only that Dives had never known paradise, while she had. For the man or woman that
                        knows a pure, self-sacrificing love, returned in kind, knows that which, of all things in this
                        world, lies nearest to God and heaven. There be those who have eara to hear this, and for them
                        is it written. Julia thought of August&apos;s love with a sinking into despair. But then
                        returned <pb id="VAA2341-087" n="95"/> the memory of his faithlessness, of all she had been
                        compelled to believe and suffer. Then her agony came back and she was glad that she had taken a
                        decided step. Any escape was a relief. I suppose it is under some such impulse that people kill
                        themselves. Julia felt as though she had committed suicide and escaped.</p>
                    <p>Humphreys on his part was not satisfied. I used the wrong figure of speech awhile ago. He was not
                        a cat with paw upon the prey. He was only an angler, and had but hooked his fish. He had not
                        landed it yet. He felt how slender was the thread of committal by which he held Julia. August
                        had her heart. He had only a word. The slender vantage that he had, he meant to use adroitly,
                        craftily. And he knew that the first thing was to close this interview without losing any
                        ground. The longer she remained bound, the better for him. And with his craft against the
                        country girl&apos;s simplicity it would have fared badly with Julia had it not been for one
                        defect which always inheres in a bad man&apos;s plots in such a case. A man like Humphreys
                        never really understands a pure woman. Certain detached facts he may know, but he can not
                        &quot;put himself in her place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Humphreys remarked with tenderness that Julia must not stay in the night air. She was too
                        precious to be exposed. This flattery was comforting to her wounded pride, and she found his
                        words pleasant to her. Had he stopped here he might have left the field victorious. But it was
                        very hard for an affianced lover to stop here. He must part from her in some other way than this
                        if he would leave on her mind the impression that she was irrevocably bound to him. He stooped
                        quickly with a well-affected devotion and lifted her hand to kiss it. That act <pb
                            id="VAA2341-088" n="90"/> awakened Julia Anderson. She must have awaked anyhow, sooner or
                        later. But when one is in the toils of such a man, sooner is better. The touch of
                        Humphreys&apos;s hand and lips sent a shudder through her frame that Humphreys felt.
                        Instantly there came to her a perception of all that marriage with a repulsive man signifies.</p>
                    <p>Not suicide, but perdition.</p>
                    <p>She jerked her hand from his as though he were a snake.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Humphreys, what did I say? I can&apos;t have you. I don&apos;t love you.
                        I&apos;m crazy to-night. I must take back what I said.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, Julia. Let me call you <hi rend="i">my</hi> Julia. You must not break my
                        heart.&quot; Humphreys had lost his cue, and every word of tenderness he spoke made his case
                        more hopeless.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never can marry youlet me go in,&quot; she said, brushing past him. Then she
                        remembered that her door was fast on the inside. She had climbed out the window. She turned
                        back, and he saw his advantage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can not release you. Take time to think before you ask it. Go to sleep now and do not
                        act hastily.&quot; He stood between her and the window, wishing to get some word to which he
                        could hold.</p>
                    <p>Julia&apos;s two black eyes grew brighter. &quot;I see. You took advantage of my trouble,
                        and you want to hold me to my words, and you are bad, and now<hi rend="i">now</hi> I hate
                        you!&quot; Then Julia felt better. Hate is the only wholesome thing in such a case. She
                        pushed him aside vigorously, stepped upon the settee, slipped in at the window, and closed it.
                        She drew the curtain, but it seemed thin, and with characteristic impulsiveness she put out her
                        light that she might have the friendly drapery of <pb id="VAA2341-089" n="97"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-090" n="99"/> darkness about her. She heard the softfor the first time it seemed
                        to her stealthytread of Humphreys, as he returned to his room. Whether she swooned or whether
                        she slept after thatshe never knew. It was morning without any time intervening, she had a
                        headache and could scarcely walk, and there was August&apos;s note lying on the floor. She
                        read it again if not with more intelligence, at least with more suspicion. She wondered at her
                        own hastiness. She tried to go about the house, but the excitement of the previous night, added
                        to all she had suffered beside, had given her a headache, blinding and paralyzing, that sent her
                        back to bed.</p>
                    <p>And there she lay in that half-asleep, half-awake mood which a nervous headache produces. She
                        seemed to be a fly in a web, and the spider was trying to fasten her. A very polite spider, with
                        that smile which went half-way up his face but which never seemed able to reach his eyes. He had
                        straps to his pantaloons, and a reddish mustache, and she shuddered as he wound his fine webs
                        about her. She tried to shake off the illusion. But the more absurd an illusion, the more it
                        will not be shaken off. For see! the spider was kissing her hand! Then she seemed tohave made a
                        great effort and to have broken the web. But her wings were torn, and her feet were Shackled by
                        the fine strands that still adhered. She could not get them off. Wouldn&apos;t somebody help
                        her, even as she had pity? And all day she would perpetually return into these half-conscious
                        states and feel the spider&apos;s web about her feet, and ask over again if somebody
                        wouldn&apos;t help her to get out of the meshes.</p>
                    <p>Toward evening her mother brought her a cup of tea and a <pb id="VAA2341-091" n="100"/> piece of
                        toast, and for the first time in the remembered life of the daughter made in endeavor to show a
                        little tenderness for fixed between mother and child it is with difficulty bridged. And finding
                        herself awkward in the new role, Mrs. Anderson dropped it and resumed her old gait, remarking,
                        as she closed the door, that she was glad to know that Julia was coming to her senses, and
                        &quot;had took the right road.&quot; For Mrs. Abigail was more vigorous than
                        grammatical.</p>
                    <p>Julia did not see anything significant in this remark at first. But after a while it came to her
                        that Humphreys must have told her mother of something that had passed during the preceding
                        night, something on which this commendation was founded. Then she fell into the same torpor and
                        was in the same old spider&apos;s web, and there was the same spider with the limited smile
                        and the mustache and the watch-seals and the straps! And he was trying to fasten her, and she
                        said &quot;yes.&quot; And she could see the little word. The spider caught it and spun
                        it into a web and fastened her with it. And she could break all the other webs but those woven
                        out of that one little word from her own lips. That clung to her, and she could neither fly nor
                        walk. August could not help herhe would not come. Her mother was helping the spider. Just then
                        Cynthy Ann came along with her broom. Would she see her and sweep her free? She tried to call
                        her, hut alas! she was a fly. She tried to buzz, but her wings were fast bound with the webs.
                        She was being smothered. The spider had seized her. She could not move. He was smiling at her!</p>
                    <p>Then she woke shuddering. It was after midnight.</p>

                        constitution had resisted the threatened illness, the feverishness had gone with the headache.
                        She felt now only one thing: she must have a friend. But the hard piousness of Cynthy
                        Ann&apos;s face had never attracted her sympathy. It had always seemed to her that Cynthy
                        disapproved of her affection quite as much as her mother did. Cynthy&apos;s face had indeed
                        a chronic air of disapproval. A nervous young minister said that he never had any
                        &quot;liberty&quot; when sister Cynthy Ann was in his congregation. She seemed averse to
                        all he said.</p>
                    <p>But now Julia felt that there was just one chance of getting advice and help. Had she not in her
                        dream seen Cynthy Ann with a broom? She would ask help from Cynthy Ann. There must be a heart
                        under her rind.</p>
                    <p>But to get to her. Her mother&apos;s affectionate vigilance never <pb id="VAA2341-093"
                            n="102"/> left her alone with Cynthy. Perhaps it was this very precaution that had suggested
                        Cynthy Ann to her as a possible ally. She must contrive to have a talk with her somehow. But
                        how? There was one way. Black-eyed people do not delay. Right or wrong, Julia acted with sharp
                        decision. Before she had any <figure entity="VAA2341-14">

                        there was one obstacle. Mr. Humphreys kept late hours, and he might be on the front-porch. She
                        might meet him in the hall, and this seemed worse to her than <pb id="VAA2341-094" n="103"/>
                        would the chance of meeting a tribe of Indians. She listened and looked out of her window; but
                        she could not be sure; she would run the risk. With silent feet and loud-beating heart she went
                        down the hall to the back upper porch, for in that day porches were built at the back and front
                        of houses, above and below. Once on the back-porch she turned to the right and stood by Cynthy
                        Ann&apos;s door. But a new fear took possession of her. If Cynthy Ann should be frightened
                        and scream!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cynthy! Cynthy Ann!&quot; she said, standing by the bed in the little bare room
                        which Cynthy Ann had occupied for five years, but into which she had made no endeavor to bring
                        one ray of sentiment or one trace of beauty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cynthy! Cynthy Ann!&quot;</p>

                        &quot;Why, child! what are you doing here? You are out of your head, and you must go back to
                        your room at once.&quot; And Cynthv had arisen and was already tugging at Julia&apos;s
                        arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I a&apos;n&apos;t out of my head, Cynthy Ann, and I <hi rend="i"

                    <p>&quot;What is the matter, Jule?&quot; said Cynthy, sitting on the bed and preparing to
                        begin again her old fight between duty and inclination. Cynthy always expected temptation. She
                        had often said in class-meeting that temptations abounded on every hand and as soon as Julia
                        told her she had a communication to make, Cynthy Ann was sure that she would find in it some
                        temptation of the devil to do something she &quot;hadn&apos;t orter <pb id="VAA2341-095"
                            n="104"/> do,&quot; according to the Bible or the Dis<hi rend="i">cip</hi>line, strictly
                        construed. And Cynthy was a &quot;strict constructionist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not find it so easy to say anything now that she had announced herself as determined to
                        have a conversation and now that her auditor was waiting. It is the worst beginning in the world
                        for a conversation, saying that you intend to converse. When an Indian has announced his
                        intention of having a &quot;big talk,&quot; he immediately lights his pipe and relapses
                        into silence until the big talk shall break out accidentally and naturally. But Julia, having
                        neither the pipe nor the Indian&apos;s stolidity, found herself under the necessity of
                        beginning abruptly. Every minute of delay made her position worse. For every minute increased
                        her doubt of Cynthy Ann&apos;s sympathy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Cynthy Ann! I&apos;m so miserable!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I told your ma this morning that you was looking mis&apos;able, and that you
                        had orter have sassafras to purify the blood, but your ma is so took up with
                        steam-docterin&apos; that she don&apos;t believe in nothin&apos; but corn-sweats and
                        such like.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! but, Cynthy, it a&apos;n&apos;t that. I&apos;m miserable in my mind. I
                        wish I knew what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought you&apos;d made up your mind. Your ma told me you was engaged to Mr.
                        Humphreys.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia was appalled. How fast the spider spins his web!</p>
                    <p>&quot;I a&apos;n&apos;t engaged to him, and I hate him. He got mo to say yes when I
                        was crazy, and I believe he brought about the things that make me feel so nigh crazy. Do you
                        think he&apos;s a good man, Cynthy Ann?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, no, though I don&apos;t want to set in no jedgment on nobody; but I
                        don&apos;t see as how as he kin be good and wear all of them costly apparels that&apos;s
                        so forbid in the Bible, to say <pb id="VAA2341-096" n="105"/> nothing of the Discipline. The
                        Bible says you must know a tree by its fruits, and I &apos;low his&apos;n is mostly
                        watch-seals. I think a good conversion at the mourners&apos; bench would make him strip off
                        some of them things, and put them into the missionary collection. Though maybe he
                        a&apos;n&apos;t so bad arter all, fer Jonas says that liker&apos;n not the things

                    <p>&quot;Cynthy, I drempt just now I was a fly and he was a epider, and that he had me all

                    <p>&quot;That must be a sign,&quot; said Cynthy Ann. &quot;It&apos;s good you

                            id="VAA2341-097" n="106"/> what about <hi rend="i">him?</hi> I thought you loved Gus Wehle,
                        and though I&apos;m afeard you&apos;re makin&apos; a idol out o&apos; him, and
                        though I&apos;m afeard he&apos;s a onbeliever, and I don&apos;t noways like
                        marryin&apos; with onbelievers, yet I did want to help you, and I brought a note from him
                        wunst and put it under the head of your bed. I was afeard then I was doin&apos; what Timothy
                        forbids, when he says not to be pertakers in other folks&apos;s sins, but, you see, how
                        could I help doin&apos; it, when you was lookin&apos; so woebegone like, and Jonas, he
                        axed me to do it. It&apos;s awful hard to say you won&apos;t to Jonas, you know. So I
                        put the letter there, and I don&apos;t doubt your ma mistrusted it, and got a holt on
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he write to me? A&apos;n&apos;t he going with that Betsey
                        Malcolm?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t be, I &apos;low. On&apos;y this evenin&apos; Jonas said to
                        me, says he, when I tole him you was engaged to Mr, Humphreys, says he, in his way, &apos;
                        The hawk&apos;s lit, has he? That&apos;ll be the death of two,&apos; says
                        he,&apos; fer she&apos;ll die on it, an&apos; so&apos;ll poor Gus-,&apos;
                        says he. And then he went on to tell as how as Gus is all ready to leave, and had ased him to
                        tell him of any news; but he said he wouldn&apos;t tell him that. He&apos;d leave him
                        some hope. Fer he says Gus was mighty nigh distracted to-day, that is yisterday, fer its most
                        morhin&apos; I &apos;low.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Now this speech did Julia a &quot;world of good. It showed her that Gus was not faithless,
                        that she might count on Cynthy, and that Jonas was her friend, and that he did not like
                        Humphreys. Jonas called him a hawk. That agreed with her dream. He was a hawk and a spider.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Cynthy Ann, I got a letter night before last; ma threw it in the window. In it Gus
                        said he released me. I hadn&apos;t asked any release. What did he mean?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-098" n="107"/>
                    <p>&quot;Honey, I wish I could help you. It&apos;s that hawk, as Jonas calls him,
                        that&apos;s at the bottom of all this trouble. I don&apos;t believe but what
                        he&apos;s told some lies or &apos;nother. I don&apos;t believe but what
                        lie&apos;s a bad man. I alters said I didn&apos;t &apos;low no good could come of a
                        man that puts on costly apparel and wears straps. I&apos;m afeard you&apos;re making a
                        idol of Gus Wehle. Don&apos;t do it. Ef you do, God&apos;ll take him. Misses Pearsons
                        made a idol of her baby, a kissin&apos; it and huggin&apos; it every minute, and I said,
                        says I, Misses Pearsons, you hadn&apos;t better make a idol of a perishin&apos;
                        creature. And sure enough, God tuck it. He&apos;s jealous of our idols. But I can&apos;t
                        help helpin&apos; you. You&apos;re a onbeliever yet yourself, and I &apos;low taint
                        no sin fer you to marry Gus, It&apos;s yokin&apos; like with like. I wish you was both
                        Christians. I&apos;ll speak to Jonas. I don&apos;t know what I ought to do, but
                        I&apos;ll speak to Jonas. He&apos;s mighty peart about seen things, is Jonas, and got as
                            <hi rend="i">good</hi> a heart as you ever see. And&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cynth-ee A-ann!&quot; It was the energetic voice of Mrs. Anderson rousing the house
                        betimes. For the first time Julia and Cynthy Ann noticed the early light creeping in at the
                        window, They sat still, paralyzed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cynth-ee!&quot; The voice was now at the top of the stairs, for Mrs. Anderson
                        always carried the war into Africa if Cynthy did not wake at once.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Answer quick, Cynthy Ann, or she&apos;ll be in here!&quot; said Julia, sliding
                        behind the bed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ma&apos;am!&quot; said Cynthy Ann, starting toward the door, where she met Mrs.
                        Abigail. &quot;I&apos;m up,&quot; said Cynthy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, what makes you so long a-answerin&apos; then? You make me climb the steps,
                        and you know I may drop down dead of heart-disease, any day. I&apos;ll go and wake
                        Jule.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-099" n="108"/>
                    <p>&quot;Better let her lay awhile,&quot; said Cynthy, reproaching herself instantly for the
                        deception.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson hesitated at the top of the stairs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jul-yee!&quot; she called. Poor Jule shook from head to foot.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess I&apos;ll let her lay awhile; but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve already
                        spoiled the child by indulgence,&quot; said the mother, descending the stairs. She relented
                        only because she believed Julia was conquered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I declare, child, it&apos;s a shame I should he helping you to disobey your mother.
                        I&apos;m afeard the Lord&apos;ll bring some jedgment on us yet,&quot; For Cynthy Ann
                        had tied her conscience to her rather infirm logic. Better to have married it to her generous
                        heart. But before she had finished the half-penitent lamentation, Jule &quot;was flying with
                        swift and silent feet down the hall. Arrived in her own room, she was so much relieved as to be
                        almost happy; and she was none too soon, for her industrious mother had quickly repented her
                        criminal leniency, and was again climbing the stairs at the imminent risk of her precarious
                        life, and calling &quot;Jul-yee!&quot;</p>

                        castle and greeted August, sitting by Andrew&apos;s loom. It was the next evening after
                        Julia&apos;s interview with Gynthy Ann. &quot;When do you &apos;low to leave this
                        terryfirmy and climb a ash-saplin&apos;? To-night, hey? Goin&apos; to the Queen City to

                    <p>Andrew stopped his loom, and, looking at August, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our friend Jonas speaks somewhat periphrastically and euphuistically, andhe&apos;ll
                        pardon mebut he speaks a little ambiguously.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My love, I gin it up, as the fish-hawk said to the bald eagle one day. I kin rattle off
                        odd sayings and big words picked up at Fourth-of-Julys and barbecues and big meetins, but when,
                        you begin to fire off your forty-pound bomb-shell bookwords, I climb down as suddent as Davy
                        Crockett&apos;s coon. Maybe I do speak unbiguously, as you say, but I was givin&apos;
                        yon the biggest talkin&apos; I had in the basket. And as fer my good news, a feller
                        don&apos;t like to eat up all Ms country sugar to wunst, I &apos;low. But I says to our
                        young and promisin&apos; friend of German extraction, beloved, says I, hold onto that air
                        limb a little longer and you&apos;re saved.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Jonas,&quot; said August, spinning Andrew&apos;s windingblade round and
                        speaking slowly and bitterly, &quot;a man don&apos;t like to be trifled with, if he is a
                        Dutchman!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But sposin&apos; a man hain&apos;t been trifled with, Dutchman or no Dutchman,?
                        Sposin&apos; it&apos;s all optical delusion of the yeers? There&apos;s a word fer

                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; said August, &quot;Betsey Malcolm&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Betsey Malcolm!</hi>&quot;said Jonas. &quot;Betsey Malcolm to
                        thunder!&quot; and then he whistled. &quot;Set a dog to mind a basket <pb
                            id="VAA2341-102" n="111"/> of meat when his chops is a-waterin&apos; fer it! Set a
                        kingfisher to take keer of a fish-pond! Set a cat to raisin&apos; your orphan chickens on
                        the bottle! Set a spider to nuss a fly sick with dyspepsy from eatin&apos; too much
                        molasses! I&apos;d ruther trust a hen-hawk with a flock of patridges than to trust Betsey
                        Malcolm with your affairs. I ha&apos;n&apos;t walked behind you from meetin&apos;
                        and seed her head a bobbin&apos; like a bluebird&apos;s and her eyes a blazin&apos;
                        an&apos; all that, fer nothin&apos;. Like as not, Betsey Malcolm&apos;s more nor
                        half your trouble in that quarter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But she said&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It don&apos;t matter three quarters of a rotten rye-straw what she said, my
                        inexper&apos;enced friend. She don&apos;t keer what she says, so long as it&apos;s
                        fur enough away from the truth to sarve her turn. An&apos; she&apos;s told pay-tent
                        double-back-action lies that worked both ways. What do you &apos;low Jule Anderson
                        tho&apos;t when she hearn tell of your courtin&apos; Betsey, as Betsey told it, with all
                        her nods an&apos; little crowin&apos;? Now looky here, Gus, I&apos;m your friend, as
                        the Irishman said to the bar that hugged him, an&apos; I want to say about all that air that
                        Betsey told you, spit on the slate an&apos; wipe that all off. They&apos;s lie in her
                        soap an&apos; right smart chance of saft-soap in her lie, I &apos;low.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These rough words of Jonas brought a strange intelligence into the mind of August. He saw so many
                        things in a moment that had lain under his eyes unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is much rough wisdom in your speech, Jonas,&quot; said Andrew.</p>

                    <p>AUGITST&apos;S own good sense told him that the advice of Jonas was not good. But he had made
                        many mistakes of late, and was just now inclined to take anybody&apos;s judgment in place of
                        his own. All that was proud and gentlemanly in him rebelled at the thought of creeping into
                        another man&apos;s house in the night. Modesty is doubtless a virtue, but it is a virtue
                        responsible for many offenses. Had August not felt so distrustful of his own wisdom, nothing
                        could have persuaded him to make his love for Julia Anderson seem criminal by an action so
                        wanting in dignity. But back of Jonas&apos;s judgment was that of Andrew, whose weakness was
                        Quixotism. He wanted to live and to have others live on the concert-pitch of romantic action.
                        There was something of chivalry in the proposal of Jonas, a spice of adventure that made him
                        approve it on purely sentimental grounds.</p>
                    <p>The more August thought of it, and the nearer he was to its execution, the more did he dislike
                        it. But I have often <pb id="VAA2341-107" n="116"/> noticed that people of a rather quiet
                        temperament, such as young Wehle&apos;s, show <hi rend="i">vis inerti$aE</hi> in both
                        waysnot very easily moved, they are not easily checked when once in motion. August&apos;s
                        velocity was not usually great, his momentum was tremendous, and now that he had committed
                        himself to the hands of Jonas Harrison and set out upon this enterprise, he was determined, in
                        his quiet way, to go through to the end.</p>
                    <p>Of course he understood the house, and having left the family in meeting, he had nothing to do
                        but to scale one of the pillars of the front-porch. In those Arcadian days upper windows were
                        hardly ever fastened, except when the house was deserted by all its inmates for days. Half-way
                        up the post he was seized with a violent trembling. His position brought to him a confused
                        memory of a text of Scripture: &quot;He that entereth not by the door . . . but climbeth up
                        some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.&quot; Bred under Moravian influence, he
                        half-believed the text to be supernaturally suggested to him. For a moment his purpose wavered,
                        but the habit of going through with an undertaking took the place of his will, and he went on
                        blindly, as Baker the Nile explorer did, &quot;more like a donkey than like a man.&quot;
                        Once on the upper porch he hesitated again. To break into a man&apos;s house in this way was
                        unlawful. His conscience troubled him. In vain he reasoned that Mrs. Anderson&apos;s
                        despotism was morally wrong, and that this action was right as an offset to it. He knew that it
                        was not right.</p>
                    <p>I want to remark here that there are many situations in life in which a conscience is dreadfully
                        in the way. There are people who go straight ahead to successsuch as it iswith no
                        embarrassments, no fire in the rear from any scruples. Some of these days I mean to write an
                        essay on &quot;The Inconvenience of <pb id="VAA2341-108" n="117"/> having a
                        Conscience,&quot; in which I shall proceed to show that it costs more in the course of a
                        year or two, than it would to keep a stableful of fast horses. Many a man could afford to drive
                        Dexters and Flora Temples who would be ruined by a conscience. But I must not write the essay
                        here, for I am keeping August out in the night air and his perplexity all this time.</p>
                    <p>August Wehle had the habit, I think I have said, of going through with an enterprise. He had
                        another habit, a very inconvenient habit doubtless, but a very manly one, of listening for the
                        voice of his conscience. And I think that this habit would have even yet turned him back, as he
                        had his hand on the window-sash, had it not been that while he stood there trying to find out
                        just what was the decision of his conscience, he heard the voices of the returning family. There
                        was no time to lose, there was no shelter on the porch, in a minute more they would be in sight.
                        He must go ahead now, for retreat was cut off. He lifted the window and climbed into the room,
                        lowering the sash gently behind him. As no one ever came into this room but Jonas, he felt safe
                        enough. Jonas would plan a meeting after midnight in Cynthy Ann&apos;s room, and in Cynthy
                        Ann&apos;s presence.</p>
                    <p>In groping for a chair, August drew aside the curtain of the gable-window, hoping to get some
                        light. Had Jonas taken to cultivating flowers in pots? Here was a &quot;monthly&quot;
                        rose on the window-seat! Surely this was the room. He had occupied it during his stay in the
                        house. But he did not know that Mrs. Anderson had changed the arrangement between his leaving
                        and the coming of Jonas. He noticed that the curtains were not the same. He trembled from head
                        to foot. He felt for the bureau, and recognized by various little articles, a pincushion, a
                        tuckcomb, <pb id="VAA2341-109" n="118"/> and the sun-bonnet hanging against the window-frame,
                        that he was in Julia&apos;s room. His first emotion was not alarm. It was awe, as pure and
                        solemn as the high-priest may have felt in the holy place. Everything pertaining to Julia had a
                        curious saeredness, and this room was a temple into &quot;which it was sacrilege to intrude.
                        But a more practical question took his attention soon. The family had come in below, except
                        Jonas and Cynthy Annwho had walked slowly, planning a meeting for August and Mr. Samuel
                        Anderson, who stood at the front-gate with a neighbor. August could hear his shrill voice
                        discussing the seventh trumpet and the thousand three hundred and thirty and five days. It would
                        not do to be discovered where he was. Beside the fright he would give to Julia, he shuddered at
                        the thought of compromising her in such a way. To go back was to insure his exposure, for Samuel
                        Anderson had not yet halfsettled the question of the trumpets. Indeed it seemed to August that
                        the world might come to an end before that conversation would. He heard Humphreys enter his
                        room. He was now persuaded that the room formerly occupied by Julia must be Jonas&apos;s,
                        and he determined to get to it if he could. He felt like a villain already. He would have
                        cheerfully gone to State&apos;sprison in preference to compromising Julia. At any rate, he
                        started out of Julia&apos;s room toward the one that was occupied by Jonas. It was the only
                        road open, and but for an unexpected encounter he would have reached his hiding-place in safety,
                        for the door was but fifteen feet away.</p>
                    <p>In order to explain the events that follow, I must ask the reader to go back to Julia, and to
                        events that had occurred two hours before. Hitherto she had _walked to and from meeting and
                        &quot;singing&quot; with Humphreys, as a matter of courtesy. On <pb id="VAA2341-110"
                            n="119"/> the evening in question she had absolutely refused to walk with him. Her mother
                        found that threats were as vain as coaxing. Even her threat of dying with heart-disease, then
                        and there, killed by her daughter&apos;s disohedience, could not move Julia, who would not
                        even speak with the &quot;spider.&quot; Her mother took her into the sitting-room alone,
                        and talked with her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So this is the way you trifle with gentlemen, is it? Night before last you engaged
                        yourself to Mr. Humphreys, now you won&apos;t speak to him. To think that my daughter should
                        prove a heartless flirt!&quot;</p>
                    <p>I am afraid that the unfilial thought came into Julia&apos;s mind that nothing could have
                        been more in the usual order of things than that the&apos; daughter of a coquette should be
                        a flirt.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll kill me on the spot; you certainly will.&quot; Julia felt anxious,
                        for her mother showed signs of going into hysterics. But she put her foot out and shook her head
                        in a way that said that all her friends might die and all the world might go to pieces before
                        she would yield. Mrs. Anderson had one forlorn hope. She determined to order that forward.
                        Leaving Julia alone, she went to her husband.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Samuel, if you value my life go and speak to your daughter. She&apos;s got your own
                        stubbornness of will in her. She is just like you; she <hi rend="i">will</hi> have her own way.
                        I shall die.&quot; And Mrs. Abigail Anderson sank into a chair with unmistakable symptoms of
                        a hysterical attack.</p>
                    <p>I am aware that I have so far let the reader hear not one word of Samuel Anderson&apos;s
                        conversation. He has played a rather insignificant part in the story. Nothing could be more <hi
                            rend="i">comme il faut</hi>. Insignificance was his characteristic. It was not so much that
                        he was small. It is not so bad a thing to be a <pb id="VAA2341-111" n="120"/> little man. But to
                        be little and insignificant also is bad. There is only one thing worse, which is to be big and
                        insignificant. If one is little and insignificant, one may toe overlooked, insignificance and
                        all. But if one is big and insignificant, it is to be an obtrusive cipher, a great lubber, not
                        easily kept out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Appealed to by his wife, Samuel Anderson prepared to assert his authority as the head of the
                        family. He almost strutted into Julia&apos;s presence. Julia had a real affection for her
                        father, and nothing mortified her more than to see him acting as a puppet, moved toy her mother,
                        and yet vain enough to believe himself independent and supreme. She would have yielded almost
                        any other point to have saved herself the mortification of seeing her father act the fool; tout
                        now she had determined that she would die and let everybody else die rather than walk with a man
                        whose nature seemed to her corrupt, and whose touch was pollution. I do not mean that she was
                        able to make a distinct inventory of her reasons for disliking him, or to analyze her feelings.
                        She could not have told just why she had so deep and utter a repugnance to walking a quarter of
                        a mile to the school-house in company with this man. She followed that strong instinct of truth
                        and purity which is the surest guide.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Julia, my daughter,&quot; said Samuel Anderson, &quot;really you must yield to
                        me as head of the house, and treat this gentleman politely. I thought you respected him, or
                        loved him, and he told me that you had given consent to marry him, and had told him to ask my
                        consent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In saying this, the &quot;head of the house &quot;was seesawing himself backward and
                        forward in his squeaky boots, speaking in a pompous manner, and with an effort to swell an
                        effeminate voice to a bass key, resulting in something between a croak <pb id="VAA2341-112"
                            n="121"/> and a squeal. Julia sat down and cried in mortification and disgust. Mr. Anderson
                        understood this to be acquiescence, and turned and &quot;went into the next room.</p>
                    <figure entity="VAA2341-17">

                    </figure>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Humphreys, my daughter will be glad to ask your pardon. She is over her little pet;
                        lovers always have pets.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-113" n="122"/>
                    <p>Even my wife and I have had our disagreements in our time. Julia will be glad to see you in the
                        sitting-room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Humphreys drew the draw-strings and set his face into Its broadest and most parallelogrammatic
                        smile, bowed to Mr. Anderson, and stepped into the hall. But when he reached the sitting-room
                        door he wished he had staid away. Julia had heard his tread, and was standing again with her
                        foot advanced. Her eyes were very black, and were drawn to a sharp focus. She had some of her
                        mother&apos;s fire, though happily none of her mother&apos;s meanness. It is hard to say
                        whether she spoke or hissed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go away, you spider! I hate you! I told you I hated you, and you told people I loved
                        you and was engaged to you. Go away! You detestable spider, you! I&apos;ll die right here,
                        but I will not go with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the smirking Humphreys moved toward her, speaking soothingly, and assuring her that there was
                        some mistake. Julia dashed past him into the parlor and laid hold of her father&apos;s arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, protect me from thatthatspider! I hate him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson stood irresolute a moment and looked appealingly to his wife for a signal. She
                        solved the difficulty herself. On the whole she had concluded not to die of heart-disease until
                        she saw Julia married to suit her taste, and having found a hill she could not go through., she
                        went round. Seizing Julia&apos;s arm with more of energy than affection, she walked off with
                        her, or rather walked her off, in a sulky silence, while Mr. Anderson kept Humphreys company.</p>
                    <p>I thought best to keep August standing in the door of Julia&apos;s room all this time while I
                        explained these things to you, so that you might understand what follows. In reality August did
                        not stop at all, but walked out into the hall and into difficulty.</p>

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">UST</hi> before August came out of the door of Julia&apos;s room he had heard
                        Humphreys enter his room on the opposite side of the hall. Humphreys had lighted his cigar and
                        was on his way to the porch to smoke off his discomfiture when he met August coming out of
                        Julia&apos;s door on the opposite side of the hall. The candle in Huinphreys&apos;s room
                        threw its light full on August&apos;s face, there was no escape from recognition, and
                        &quot;Wehle was too proud to retreat. He shut the door of Julia&apos;s room and stood
                        with back against the wall staring at Humphreys, who did not forget to smile in his most
                        aggravating way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thief! thief!&quot; called Humphreys.</p>
                    <p>In a moment Mrs. Anderson and Julia ran up the stairs, followed by Mr. Anderson, who hearing the
                        outcry had left the matter of the Apocalypse unsettled, and by Jonas and Cynthy Ann, who had
                        just arrived.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew it,&quot; cried Mrs. Anderson, turning on the mortified Julia, &quot;I
                        never knew a Dutchman nor a foreigner of any sort <pb id="VAA2341-115" n="124"/> that
                        wouldn&apos;t steal. Now you see what you get by taking a fancy to a Dutchman, And now <hi
                            rend="i">you</hi> see&quot;to her husband &quot;what <hi rend="i">you</hi> get by
                        taking a Dutchman into your house. I always wanted you to hire &quot;white men and not
                        Dutchmen nor thieves!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Anderson,&quot; said August, with very white lips,
                        &quot;I am not a thief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a thief, eh? What was he doing, Mr. Humphreys, when you first detected
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Coming out of Miss Anderson&apos;s room,&quot; said Humphreys, smiling
                        politely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you invite gentlemen to your room?&quot; said the frantic woman to Julia,
                        meaning by one blow to revenge herself and crush the stubbornness of her daughter forever. But
                        Julia was too anxious about August to notice the shameless insult.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mrs. Anderson, this visit is without any invitation from Julia. I did wrong to enter
                        your house in this way, but I only am responsible, and I meant to enter. Jonas&apos;s room.
                        I did not know that Julia occupied this room. I am to blame, she is not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what did yon break in for if you didn&apos;t mean to steal? It is all off
                        between you and Jule, for I saw your letter. I shall have you arrested to-morrow for burglary.
                        And I think you ought to be searched. Mr. Humphreys, won&apos;t you put him out?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Humphreys stepped forward toward August, hut he&apos; noticed that the latter had a hard look
                        in his eyes, and had two stout German fists shut very tight. He turned back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;These thieves are nearly always armed. I think I had best get a pistol out of my
                        trunk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have no arms, and you know it, coward,&quot; said August &quot;I will not be
                        put out by anybody, but I will go out whenever <pb id="VAA2341-116" n="126"/>

                    <p>&quot;Jonas, put him out!&quot; screamed Mrs. Anderson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t do it,&quot; said Jonas, &quot;couldn&apos;t do it ef I
                        tried. They&apos;s too much bone and sinnoo in them arms of his&apos;n, and moreover
                        he&apos;s a gentleman. I axed him to come and see me sometime, and he come. He come ruther
                        late it&apos;s true, but I s&apos;pose he thought that sence we got sech a dee-splay of
                        watchseals and straps we had all got so stuck up, we wouldn&apos;t receive calls afore
                        fashionable hours. Any way, I &apos;low he didn&apos;t mean no harm, and he&apos;s
                        my visitor, seein&apos; he meant to come into my winder, knowin&apos; the door was
                        closed agin him. And he won&apos;t let no man put him out, &apos;thout he&apos;s a
                        man with more&apos;n half a dozen watch-seals onto him, to give him weight and
                        influence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Samuel, will you see me insulted in this way? Will you put this burglar out of the
                        house?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The &quot;head of the house,&quot; thus appealed to, tried to look important; he tried to
                        swell up his size and his courage. But he did not dare touch August.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Anderson, I beg <hi rend="i">your</hi> pardon. I had no right to come in as I did.
                        I had no right so to enter a gentleman&apos;s house. If I had not known that this cowardly
                        fopI don&apos;t know what <hi rend="i">else</hi> he may bewas injuring me by his lies I
                        should not have come in. If it is a crime to love a young lady, then I have committed a crime.
                        You have only to exercise your authority as master of this house and ask me to go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do ask you to go, Mr. Wehle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was the first time that Samuel Anderson had ever called him Mr. Wehle. It was an involuntary
                        tribute to the dignity of the young man, as he stood at bay.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-118" n="128"/>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Wehle, <hi rend="i">indeed!</hi>&quot;said Mrs. Anderson.</p>
                    <p>August had hoped Julia would say a word in his behalf. But she was too much cowed by her
                        mother&apos;s fierce passion. So like a criminal going to prison, like a roan going to his
                        own funeral, August &quot;Wehle went down the hall toward the stairs, which were at the back
                        of it. Humphreys instinctively retreated into his room. Mrs. Anderson glared ou the young man as
                        he went by, but he did not turn his head even when he passed Julia. His heart and hope were all
                        gone; in his mortification and defeat there seemed to him nothing left but his unbroken pride to
                        sustain him. He had descended two or three steps, when Julia suddenly glided forward and said
                        with a tremulous voice: &quot;You aren&apos;t going without telling me good-by,
                        August?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jule Anderson! what do you mean? &quot;cried her mother. But the hall was narrow by
                        the stairway, and Jonas, by standing close to Cynthy Ann, in an unconscious sort of a way
                        managed to keep Mrs. Anderson back; else she would have laid violent hands on. her daughter.</p>
                    <p>When August lifted his eyes and saw her face full of tenderness and her hand reached over the
                        balusters to him, he seemed to have been suddenly lifted from perdition to bliss. The tears ran
                        unrestrained upon Ms cheeks, he reached up and took her hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by, Jule! God bless you!&quot; he said huskily, and went out into the night,
                        happy in spite of all.</p>

                        all the <hi rend="i">contretemps</hi> of his provoking misadventure; happy in spite of the
                        threat of arrest for burglary. For nearly a minute August Wehle was happy in that perfect way in
                        which people of quiet tempers are happyhappy without fluster. But before he had passed the gate,
                        he heard a scream and a wild hysterical laugh; he heard a hurrying of feet and saw a moving of
                        lights. He would fain have turned back to find out what the matter was, he had so much of
                        interest in that house, but he remembered that he had been turned out and that he could not go
                        back. The feeling of outlawry mingled its bitterness with the feeling of anxiety. He feared that
                        something had happened to Julia; he lingered and listened. Humphreys came out upon the upper
                        porch and looked sharply up and down the road. August felt instinctively that he was the object
                        of search and slunk into a fence-corner, remembering that he was now a burglar and at the mercy
                        of the man whose face was enough to show him unrelenting.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-120" n="130"/>
                    <p>Presently Humphreys turned and went in, and then August came out of the shadow and hurried away.
                        When he had gone a mile, he heard the hoofs of horses, and again he concealed himself with a
                        cowardly feeling he had never known before. But when he found that it was Jonas, riding one
                        horse and leading another, on his way to bring Dr. Ketchup, the steam-doctor, he ran out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jonas! Jonas! what&apos;s the matter? &quot;Who&apos;s sick? Is it
                        Julia?&quot;</p>

                        better gin a thought to yourself now. I got you into this scrape, and I mean to see you out, as
                        the dog said to the &apos;possum in its hole. Git up onto this four-legged quadruped and go
                        as fur as I go on the road to peace and safety. Now, I tell you what, the hawk&apos;s got a

                        the river into the glorious State of ole Kaintuck afore any warrant can be got out fer

                        mighty deceitful and onsartain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As far as Jonas traveled his way, he carried August upon the gray horse. Then the latter hurried
                        across the fields to his father&apos;s cabin. Little &quot;Wilhelmina sat with face
                        against the window waiting his return.</p>

                        head on his hand, and told the whole adventure of the evening to his mother, and then dropped
                        his head on her lap and wept in a still way. And the sweeteyed, weary Moravian mother laid her
                        two hands upon his head and prayed. And Wilhelmina knelt instinctively by the side of her
                        brother.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps there is no God. Or perhaps He is so great that our praying has no effect. Perhaps this
                        strong crying of our hearts to Him in our extremity is no witness of his readiness to hear. Let
                        him live in doubt who can. Let me believe that the tender mother-heart and the loving

                    <p>At two o&apos;clock that night August Wehle stood upon the shore of the Ohio in company with
                        Andrew Anderson, the Backwoods Philosopher. Andrew waved a fire-brand at the steamboat
                        &quot;Isaac Shelby,&quot; which was coming round the bend. And the captain tapped his
                        bell three times and stopped his engines. Then the yawl took the two men aboard, and two days

                        prepared to go for the doctor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Samuel! O Sam-u-el! Oh-h-h-h-h!&quot; cried Mrs. Anderson, with rising and falling
                        inflections that even patient Dr. Rush could never have analyzed, laughing insanely and weeping
                        pitedown <pb id="VAA2341-124" n="134"/> the gamut in an uncontrolled and uncontrollable way; now
                        whooping like a savage, and now sobbing like the last breath of a broken-hearted.

                        Think&quot; here <pb id="VAA2341-125" n="135"/> her breath died away, and for a moment she
                        seemed really to be dying. &quot;Think,&quot; she gasped, and then sank away again.
                        After a minute she opened her eyes, and, with characteristic pertinacity, took up the sentence
                        just where she had left off. She had carefully kept her place throughout the period of unshrill,
                        unnatural falsetto so characteristic of hysteria; that voice the discord. &quot;Think,
                        oh-h-h Samuel! why won&apos;t you think what a wife I&apos;ve been to you? Here
                        I&apos;ve drudged and scrubbed <pb id="VAA2341-126" n="136"/> wisdom which taught them how
                        to decide in any given case whether ginseng or a corn-sweat was the required remedy. And the
                        invested twenty dollars had brought the shrewd blacksmith a handsome return.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello! &quot;said Jonas in true Western style, as he reined up in front of Dr.
                        Ketchup&apos;s house in the outskirts of Brayville. &quot;Hello the house!&quot; But
                        Dr. Ketchup was already asleep. &quot;Takes a mighty long time to wake up a fat
                        man,&quot; soliloquized Jonas. &quot;He gits so used to hearin&apos; hisself snore
                        that he can&apos;t tell the difference &apos;twixt snorin&apos; and thunder. Hello!

                    <p>This last exclamation greeted the appearance of Dr. Ketchup&apos;s head at the window.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you drunk, Jonas Harrison? Go &apos;way with your hollering, or I&apos;ll

                        friend and feller-citizen. I&apos;ll hare you took up fer sleeping so sound and

                    <p>The head of Dr. Ketchup had disappeared from the window about the middle of this speech, and the
                        remainder of it came by sheer force of internal pressure, like the flowing of an artesian well.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ketchup walked out, with ruffled dignity, carefully dressed. His immaculate clothes and his
                        solemn face were the two halves of his stock in trade. Under the clothes lay buried Ketchup the
                        blacksmith; under the wiseacre face was Ketchup the ignoramus. Ignoramus he was, but not a fool.
                        As he rode along back with Jonas, he plied the latter with questions. If he could get the facts
                        of the case out of Jonas, he would pretend to have inferred them from the symptoms and thus add
                        to his credit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What caused this attack, Jonas?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I &apos;low she caused it herself. Generally does, my friend,&quot; Baid Jonas.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Had anything occurred to excite her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, yes, I &apos;low they had; consid&apos;able, if not more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, you see she&apos;d been to Hankins&apos;s preachin&apos;. Now, I
                        &apos;low, my medical friend, the day of jedgment a&apos;n&apos;t a
                        pleasin&apos; prospeck to anybody that&apos;s jilted one brother to marry another, and
                        then cheated the jilted one outen his sheer of his lamented father&apos;s estate. Do you
                        think it is, my learned friend?&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Dr. Ketchup could not be sure whether Jonas was making game of him or not. So he changed the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nice boss, this bay,&quot; said the &quot;doctor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Jonas, &quot;I don&apos;t &apos;low you ever put
                        shoes on <pb id="VAA2341-129" n="140"/> no better hoss than this &apos;ere in all your
                        daysas a blacksmith. Did you now, my medical friend?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I think not,&quot; said Ketchup testily, and was silent.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson had grown impatient at the doctor&apos;s delay.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Samuel! Oo! oo! oo! Samuel! My dear, I&apos;m dying. Jonas don&apos;t care. He
                        wouldn&apos;t hurry. I wonder you trusted <hi rend="i">him!</hi> If you had been dying, I
                        should have gone myself for the doctor. Oo! oo! oo! <hi rend="i">oh!</hi> If I should die,
                        nobody would be sorry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Abigail Anderson was not to blame for telling the truth so exactly in this last sentence. It was
                        an accident. She might have recalled it but that Dr. Ketchup walked in at that moment.</p>
                    <p>He felt her pulse; looked at her tongue; said that it was heart-disease, caused by excitement. He
                        thought it must be religious excitement. She should have a corn-sweat and some wafer-ash tea.
                        The corn-sweat would act as a tonic and strengthen the pericardium. The wafer-ash would cause a
                        tendency of blood to the head, and thus relieve the pressure on the jugglervein. Cynthy Ann
                        listened admiringly to Dr. Ketchup&apos;s incomprehensible, oracular utterances, and then
                        speedily put a bushel of ear-corn in the great wash-boiler, which was already full of hot water
                        in expectation of such a prescription, and set the wafer-ash to draw.</p>
                    <p>Julia had, up to this time, stood outside her mother&apos;s door trembling with fear, and not
                        daring to enter. She longed to do something, but did not know how it would be received. Now,
                        while the deep, sonorous voice of Ketchup occupied the attention of all, she crept in and stood
                        at the foot of Mrs. Anderson&apos;s bed. The mother, recovering from her twentieth dying
                        spell, saw her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take her away! She has killed me! She wants me to die! <hi rend="i">I</hi> know! Take
                        her away;!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-130" n="141"/>
                    <p>And Julia went to her own room and shut herself up in darkness and in wretchedness, but in all
                        that miserable night there came to her not one regret that she had reached her hand to the
                        departing August.</p>
                    <p>The neighbor-women came in and pretended to do something for the invalid, but really they sat by
                        the kitchen-stove and pumped Cynthy Ann and the doctor, and managed in some way to connect Julia
                        with her mother&apos;s illness, and shook their heads. So that when Julia crept down-stairs
                        at midnight, in hope of being useful, she found herself looked at inquisitively, and felt
                        herself to be such an object of attention that she was glad to take the advice of Cynthy Ann and
                        find refuge in her own room. On the stairs she met Jonas, who said as she passed:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t fret yourself, little turtle-dove. Don&apos;t pay no
                        &apos;tention to ole Ketchup. Your ma won&apos;t die, not even with his cornsweats to
                        waft her on to glory. You done your duty to-night like one of Fox&apos;s martyrs, and like
                        George &quot;Washi&apos;ton with his little cherry-tree and hatchet. And you&apos;ll
                        git your reward, if not in the nest world, you&apos;ll have it in this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia lay down awhile, and then sat up, looking out into the darkness. Perhaps God was angry with
                        her for loving August; perhaps she was making an idol of him. &quot;When Julia came to think
                        that her love for August was in antagonism to the lore of God, she did not hesitate which she
                        would choose. All the best of her nature was loyal to August, whom she &quot;had
                        seen,&quot; as the Apostle John has it. She could not reason it out, but a God who seemed to
                        be in opposition to the purest and best emotion of her heart was a God she could not love.
                        August and the love of August were known quantities. God and the love of God were unknown, and
                        the God of whom Cynthy spoke (and <pb id="VAA2341-131" n="142"/> of whom many a mistaken
                        preacher has spoken), that was jealous of Mrs. Pearson&apos;s love for her baby, and that
                        killed it because it was his rival, was not a God that she could love without being a traitor to
                        all the good that God had put in her heart. The God that was keeping August away from her
                        because he was jealous of the one beautiful thing in her life was a Moloch, and she deliberately
                        determined that she would not worship or love him. The True God, who is a Father, and who is not
                        Supreme Selfishness, doing all for His own glory, as men falsely declare; the True Godwho does
                        all things for the good of othersloved her, I doubt not, for refusing to worship the
                        Conventional Deity thus presented to her mind. Even as He has pitied many a mother that rebelled
                        against the Governor of the Universe, because she was told the Governor of the Universe, in a
                        petty seeking for his own glory, had taken away her &quot;idols.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Julia looked up at the depths between the stars, and felt how great God must be, and her
                        rebellion against Him seemed a war at fearful odds. And then the sense of God&apos;s
                        omnipresence, of His being there alone with her, so startled her and awakened such a feeling of
                        her fearful loneliness, orphanage, antagonism to God, that she could bear it no longer, and at
                        two o&apos;clock she went down again; but Mrs. Brown looked over at Mrs. Orcutt in a way
                        that said: &quot;Told you so! Guilty conscience! Can&apos;t sleep!&quot; And so
                        Julia thought God, even as she conceived Him, better company than men, or rather than women,
                        forwell, I won&apos;t make the ungallant remark; each sex has its besetting faults.</p>
                    <p>Julia took back with her a candle, thinking that this awful God would not seem so close if she
                        had a light. There lay on her bureau a Testament, one of those old editions of the American <pb
                            id="VAA2341-132" n="143"/> Bible Society, printed on indifferent paper, and bound in a red
                        muslin that was given to fading, the like whereof in bookmaking; has never been seen since. She
                        felt angry with God, who, she was sure, was persecuting her, as Cynthy Ann had said, out of
                        jealousy of her love for August, and she was determined that she would not look into that
                        red-cloth Testament, which seemed to her full of condemnation. But there was a fascination about
                        it she could not resist. The discordant hysterical laughter of her mother, which reached her
                        ears from below, harrowed her sorely, and her grief and despair at her own situation were so
                        great that she was at last fain to read the only book in the room in order that she might occupy
                        her mind. There is a strange superstition among certain pietists which leads them to pray for a
                        test to guide them, and then take any chance passage as a divine direction. I do not mean to say
                        that Julia had any supernatural leading in her reading. The New Testament is so full of comfort
                        that one could hardly manage to miss it. She read the seventh chapter of Luke: how the Lord
                        healed the centurion&apos;s servant that was &quot;dear unto him,&quot; and noted
                        that He did not rebuke the man for loving his slave; how the Lord took pity on that poor widow
                        who wept at the bier of her only son, and brought him back to life again, and &quot;restored
                        him to his mother.&quot; This did not seem to be just the Christ that Cynthy Ann thought of
                        as the foe of every human affection. She read more that she did not understand so well, and then
                        at the end of the chapter she read about the woman that was a sinner, that washed His feet with
                        grateful tears and wiped them with her hair. And she would have taken the woman&apos;s guilt
                        to have had the woman&apos;s opportunity and her benediction.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-133" n="144"/>
                    <p>At last, turning over the leaves without any definite purpose, she lighted on a place in Matthew,
                        where three verses at the end of a chapter happened to stand at the head of a column. I suppose
                        she read them because the beginning of the page and the end of the chapter made them seem a
                        short detached piece. And they melted into her mood so that she seemed to know Christ and God
                        for the first time. &quot;Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden,&quot; she
                        read, and stopped. That means me, she thought with a heart ready to burst. And that saying is
                        the gateway of life. When the promises and injunctions mean, me, I am saved. Julia read on,
                        &quot;And I will give you rest.&quot; And so she drank in the passage, clause by clause,
                        until she came to the end about an easy yoke and a light burden, and then God seemed to her so
                        different. She prayed for August, for now the two loves, the love for August and the love for
                        Christ, seemed not in any way inconsistent. She lay down saying over and over, with tears in her
                        eyes, &apos;&apos; rest for your souls,&quot; and&quot; weary and heavy
                        laden,&quot; and &quot;come unto me,&quot; and &quot;meek and lowly of
                        heart,&quot; and then she settled on one word and repeated it over and over, &quot;rest,
                        rest, rest.&quot; The old feeling was gone. She was no more a rebel nor an orphan. The
                        presence of God was not a terror but a benediction. She had found rest for her soul, and He gave
                        His beloved sleep. For when she awoke from what seemed a short slumber, the red light of a
                        glorious dawn came in at the window, and her candle was flickering its last in the bottom of the
                        socket. The Testament lay open as she bad left it, and for days she kept it open there, and did
                        not dare read anything but these three verses, lest she should lose the rest for her soul that
                        she found here.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">THE HAWK IN A NEW PART.</head>
                    <p>H<hi rend="sc">UMPHREYS</hi> was now in the last weeks of his singing-school. He had become a
                        devout Millerite, and was paying attentions to the not unwilling Betsey Malcolm, though
                        pretending at Anderson&apos;s to be absolutely heart-broken at the conduct of Julia in
                        jilting him after she had given him every assurance of affection. And then to be jilted for a
                        Dutchman, you know! In this last regard his feeling was not all affectation. In his soul,
                        cupidity, vanity, and vindictiveness divided the narrow territory between them. He inwardly
                        swore that he&apos;d get satisfaction somehow. Debts which were due to his pride should be
                        collected by his revenge.</p>
                    <p>Did you ever reflect on the uselessness of a landscape when one has no eyes to see it with, or,
                        what is worse, no soul to look through one&apos;s eyes? Humphreys was going down to the
                        castle to call on the Philosopher, and &quot;Shady Hollow,&quot; as Andrew called it,
                        had surely never been more glorious than on the morning which he chose for his walk. The
                        black-haw bushes hung over the roadside, the maples lifted up their great trunk-pillars <pb
                            id="VAA2341-135" n="146"/> toward the sky, and the grape-vines, some of them four and even
                        six inches in diameter, reached up to the high boughs, fifty or a hundred feet, without touching
                        the trunk. They had been carried up by the growth of the tree, tree and vine having always lived
                        in each other&apos;s embrace. Out through, the opening in the hollow, Humphreys saw the
                        green sea of six-feet-high Indian corn in the fertile bottoms, the two rows of sycamores on the
                        sandy edges of the river, and the hazy hills on the Kentucky side. But not one touch of
                        sentiment, not a perception of beauty, entered the soul of the singing-master as he daintily
                        chose his steps so as to avoid soiling his glossy boots, and as he knocked the leaves off the
                        low-hanging beech boughs with his delicate cane. He had his purpose in. visiting Andrew, and his
                        mind was bent on his game.</p>
                    <p>Charon, the guardian of the castle, bayed his great hoarse bark at the Hawk, and with that keen
                        insight into human nature for which dogs are so remarkable, he absolutely forbade the
                        dandy&apos;s entrance, until Andrew appeared at the door and called the dog away.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am delighted at having the opportunity of meeting a great light in literature like
                        yourself, Mr. Anderson. Here you sit weaving, earning your bread with a manly simplicity that is
                        truly admirable. You are like Cincinnatus at his plow. I also am a literary man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He really was a college graduate, though doubtless he was as much of a humbug in recitations and
                        examinations as he had always been since. Andrew&apos;s only reply to his assertion that he
                        was a literary man was a rather severe and prolonged scrutiny of his oily locks, his dainty
                        mustache, his breast-pin, his watchseals, and finally his straps and his boots. For Andrew
                        firmly <pb id="VAA2341-136" n="147"/> believed that neglected hair, Byron collars, and
                        unblackened boots were the first signs of literary taste.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think I dress too well,&quot; said Humphreys with his ghastly smirk,
                        &quot;You think that I care too much for appearances. I do. It is a weakness of mine which
                        comes from a residence abroad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>These words touched the Philosopher a little. To hare been abroad was the next best thing to
                        having been a foreigner <hi rend="i">ab origine</hi>. But still he felt a little suspicious. He
                        was superior to the popular prejudice against the mustache, but he could not endure hair-oil.
                        &quot;Nature,&quot; he maintained, &quot;made the whole beard to be worn, and Nature
                        provides an oil for the hair. Let Nature have her way.&quot; He was suspicious of Humphreys,
                        not because he wore a mustache, but because he shaved the rest of his face and greased his hair.
                        He had, besides, a little intuitive perception of the fact that a smile which breaks against the
                        rock-bound coast of cold cheek-bones and immovable eyes is a mask. And so he determined to test
                        the literary man. I have heard that Masonic lodges have been deceived by impostors. I have never
                        heard that a literary man was made to believe in the genuineness of the attainments of a
                        charlatan.</p>
                    <p>And yet Humphreys held his own well. He could talk glibly and superficially about books; he
                        simulated considerable enthusiasm for the books which Andrew admired. His mistake and his
                        consequent overthrow came, as always in such case&apos;s, from a desire to overdo. It was
                        after half an hour of talking without tripping that Andrew suddenly asked: &quot;Do you like
                        the everto-be-admired Xenophanes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>It certainly is no disgrace to any literary man not to know anything of so remote a philosopher
                        as Xenophanes. The first <pb id="VAA2341-137" n="148"/> characteristic of a genuine literary man
                        is the frankness with which he confesses his ignorance. But Humphreys did not really know but
                        that Xenophanes was part of the daily reading of a man of letters.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; said he. &quot;I have his works in turkey morocco.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you think of his opinion that God is a sphere? &quot;asked the Philosopher,
                        smiling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! yesahem; let me seewhich God is it that he speaks of, Jupiter orwell, you know he
                        was a Greek.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he only believed in one God,&quot; said Andrew sternly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! ah! I forgot that he was a Christian.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So from blunder to blunder Andrew pushed him, Humphreys stumbling more and more in his blind
                        attempts to right himself, and leaving, at last, with much internal confusion but with an
                        unruffled smile. He dared not broach his errand by asking the address of August. For Andrew did
                        not conceal his disgust, having resumed work at his loom, suffering the bowing impostor to find
                        his own way out without so much as a courteous adieu.</p>

                    <p>S<hi rend="sc">OMETIMES</hi> tlie virus of a family is all drawn off in one vial. I think it is
                        Emerson who makes this remark. We have all seen the vials.</p>
                    <p>Such an one was Norman Anderson. The curious law of hereditary descent had somehow worked him
                        only evil. &quot;Nater,&quot; observed Jonas to Cynthy, when the latter had announced to
                        him that Norman, on account of some disgrace at school, had returned home, &quot;nater
                        ha&apos;n&apos;t done him half jestice, I &apos;low. It went through Sam&apos;el
                        Anderson and Abig&apos;il, and picked out the leetle weak pompous things in the illustrious
                        father, and then hunted out all the spiteful and hateful things in the lovin&apos; and
                        much-esteemed mother, and somehow stuck &apos;em together, to make as ornery a chap as ever
                        bit a hoe-cake in two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afeard her brother&apos;s scrape and comin&apos; home
                        won&apos;t make Jule none the peacefuller at the present time,&quot; said Cynthy Ann.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wal,&quot; returned Jonas, &quot;I don&apos;t think she keers much fer him.
                        She couldn&apos;t, you know. Love him? Now, Cynthy Ann, my dear&quot;here Cynthy Ann
                        began to reproach herself <pb id="VAA2341-139" n="150"/> for listening to anything so pleasant
                        as these two last words &quot;Now, Cynthy Ann, my dear, you see you might maybe love a
                        cuckle-burr and miss it; &quot;but I don&apos;t think you would be likely to. I never
                        heern tell of nobody carryin&apos; jimson-weed pods in their bosoms. You see they
                        a&apos;n&apos;t no place about Norman Anderson that love could take a holt of
                        &apos;thout gittin&apos; scratched.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But his mother loves him, I reckon,&quot; said Cynthy Ann.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wal, yes; so she do. Loves her shadder in the lookin&apos;-glass, maybe, and kinder
                        loves Norman bekase he&apos;s got so much, of her devil into him. It&apos;s like
                        lovin&apos; like, I reckon. But I &apos;low they&apos;s a right smart difference
                        with Jule. Sence she was born, that Norman has took more delight in tormentin&apos; Jule
                        than a yaller dog with a white tail does in worryin&apos; a brindle tom-cat up a peach-tree.
                        And comin&apos; home at this junction he&apos;ll gin her a all-fired lot of trials and
                        tribulation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At the time this conversation took place, two weeks had elapsed since Mrs. Anderson&apos;s
                        &quot;attack.&quot; Julia had heard nothing from August yet. The
                        &quot;Hawk&quot; still made his head-quarters in the house, but was now watching another
                        quarry. Mrs. Anderson was able to scold as vigorously as ever, if, indeed, that function had
                        ever been suspended. And just now she was engaged in scolding the teacher who had expelled
                        Norman. The habit of fighting teachers was as chronic as her heart-disease. Norman had always
                        been abused by the whole race of pedagogues. There was from the first a conspiracy against him,
                        and now he was cheated out of his last chance of getting an education. All this Norman
                        steadfastly believed.</p>
                    <p>Of course Norman sided with his mother as against the Dutchman. The more contemptible a man is,
                        the more he Contemns <pb id="VAA2341-140" n="151"/> a man for not belonging to his race or
                        nation. And Norman felt that he would be eternally disgraced by any alliance with a German. He
                        threw himself into the fight with a great deal of vigor. It helped him to forget other things.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jule,&quot; said he, walking up to her as she sat alone on the porch,
                        &quot;I&apos;m ashamed of you. To go and fall in love with a Dutchman like Gus Wahle,
                        and disgrace us all!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder you didn&apos;t think about disgrace before,&quot; retorted <figure
                            entity="VAA2341-22">
                            <p rend="center">NORMAN ANDERSON.</p>
                        </figure> Julia, &quot;I am ashamed to have August Wehle hear what you&apos;ve been
                        doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dogs that have the most practice in cat-worrying are liable to get their noses scratched
                        sometimes. Norman took care never to attack Julia again except under the guns of his
                        mother&apos;s power ful battery. And he revenged himself on her by appealing to <pb
                            id="VAA2341-141" n="152"/> his mother with a complaint that &quot;Jule had throwed up to
                        him that he had been dismissed from school.&quot; And of course Julia received a solemn
                        lecture on her way of driving poor Norman to destruction. She was determined to disgrace the
                        family. If she could not do it by marrying a Dutchman, she would do it by slandering her
                        brother.</p>
                    <p>Norman, thought to find an ally in Jonas.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jonas, don&apos;t you think it&apos;s awful that Jule is in love with a
                        Dutchman like Gus Wehle?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do, my love,&quot; responded Jonas. &quot;I think a Dutchman is a Dutchman. I
                        don&apos;t keer how much he larns by burnin&apos; the midnight ile by day and night. My
                        time-honored friend, he&apos;s a Dutchman arter all. The Dutch is bred in the bone. It
                        won&apos;t fade. A Dutchman may be a gentleman in his way of doin&apos; things, may be
                        honest and industrious, and keep all the commandments in the catalogue, but I say he is Dutch,
                        and that&apos;s enough to keep him out of the kingdom of heaven and out of this free and
                        enlightened republic. And an American may be a good-fer-nothin&apos;, ornery little
                        pertater-ball, wuthless alike to man and beast; he mayn&apos;t be good fer nothin&apos;,
                        nuther fer work nur study; he may git drunk and git turned outen school and do any pertikeler
                        number of disgraceful and oncreditable things, he may be a reg&apos;ler milksop and
                        nincompoop, a fool and a blackguard and a coward all rolled up into one piece of brown paper, ef
                        he wants to. And what&apos;s to hender? A&apos;n&apos;t he a free-born an&apos;
                        enlightened citizen of this glorious and civilized and Christian land of Hail Columby? What
                        business has a Dutchman, ef he&apos;s ever so smart and honest and lamed, got in our broad
                        domains, resarved for civil and religious liberty? What business has he got breathin&apos;
                        our atmosphere or takin&apos; <pb id="VAA2341-142" n="153"/> refuge under the feathers of
                        our American turkey-buzzard? No, my beloved and respected feller-citizen of native birth,
                        it&apos;s as plain to me as the wheels of &apos;Zek&apos;el and the year 1843. I
                        say, Hip, hip, hoo-ray fer liberty or death, and down with the Dutch!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Norman Anderson scratched his head.</p>
                    <p>What did Jonas mean?</p>
                    <p>He couldn&apos;t exactly divine; but it is safe to say that on the whole he was not entirely
                        satisfied with this boomerang speech. He rather thought that he had better not depend on Jonas.</p>
                    <p>But he was not long in finding allies enough in his war against Germany.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HERE</hi> was an egg-supper in the country store at Brayville. Mr. Mandluff, the
                        tall and rawboned Hoosier who kept the store, was not unwilling to have the boys get up an egg
                        supper now and then in his store after he had closed the front-door at night.</p>
                    <p>For you must know that an egg-supper is a peculiar Western institution. Sometimes it is a most
                        enjoyable institutionwhen it has its place in a store where there is no Kentucky whisky to be

                        not very graceful Mr. Mandluff, an egg-supper was not a great moral institution. It was
                        otherwise, and profanely called by its votaries a campmeeting; it would be hard to tell why,
                        unless it was that some of the insiders grew very happy before it was over. For an eggsupper at
                        Mandluff&apos;s store was to Brayville what an oystersupper at Delmonico&apos;s is to
                        New York. It was one tenth hard eggs and nine tenths that beverage which bears the name of an
                        old royal house of France.</p>
                    <p>How were the eggs cooked? I knew somebody would ask that impertinent question. Well, they were
                        not fried, they were <pb id="VAA2341-144" n="155"/> not boiled, they were not poached, they were
                        not scrambled, they were not omeletted, they were not roasted on the half-shell, they were not
                        stuffed with garlic and served with cranberries, they were not boiled and served with, anchovy
                        sauce, they were not &quot;<hi rend="i">en salmi.</hi>&quot;I think I had better stop
                        there, lest I betray my knowledge of cookery. It is sufficient to say that they were not cooked
                        in any of the above-named fashions, nor in any other way mentioned in Catharine
                        Beecher&apos;s or Marion Harland&apos;s cookbooks. They were baked <hi rend="i">a la
                            mode</hi> backwoods. It ia hardlyproper for me to give a recipe in this place, that belongs
                        more properly to the &quot;Household Departments&quot; of the newspapers. But to satisfy
                        curiosity, and to tell something about cooking, which Prof. Blot does not know, I may say that
                        they were broken and dropped on a piece of brown paper laid on the top of the old bos-stove. By
                        the time the egg was cooked hard the paper was burned to ashes, but the egg came off clean and
                        nice from the stove, and made as palatable and indigestible an article for a late supper as one
                        could wish. It only wanted the addition of Mandluffs peculiar whisky to make it dissipation of
                        the choicest kind. For the more a dissipation costs in life and health, the more fascinating it
                        is.</p>
                    <p>There was an egg-supper, as I said, at MandlufTs store. There was to be a
                        &quot;camp-meeting&quot; in honor of Norman Anderson&apos;s successful return to his
                        liberty and his cronies. It gave Norman the greatest pleasure to return to a society where it
                        was rather to his credit than otherwise that he had gone on a big old time, got caught, and been
                        sent adrift by the old hunk that had tried to make him study Latin.</p>
                    <p>The eggs were baked in the true &quot;camp-meeting&quot; style, the whisky wife drunk,
                        andso was the company. Bill Day&apos;s rather <pb id="VAA2341-145" n="156"/> red eyes grew
                        redder, and his nose shone with delight as he shuffled the greasy pack of
                        &quot;kyerds.&quot; The maudlin smile crossed the habitually melancholy lines of his
                        face, in a way that split and splintered his visage into a curious contradiction of emotions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haoop!&quot; he shouted, throwing away the cards over the heads of his companions.
                        &quot;Haoop! boys, thish is big hoo! hoo! haoop! I say is big. Let&apos;s do
                        somethin&apos;!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here there was a confused cry that &quot;it <hi rend="i">was</hi> big, and that they had
                        better do somethin&apos; or &apos;nother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s blow up the ole school-house,&quot; said Bill Day, who was not
                        friendly to education.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said Bob Short, who was dealing the cards in another
                        set&quot;I tell you what,&quot; and Bob winked his eyes vigorously, and looked more
                        solemn and wise than he could have looked if it had not been for the hard eggs and the whisky
                        &quot;I tell you what,&quot; said Bob a third time, and halted, for his mind&apos;s
                        activity was a little choked by the fervor of his emotions &quot;I tell you what,
                        boys&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wal,&quot; piped Jim West in a cracked voice, &quot;you&apos;ve told us <hi

                    <p>&quot;I tell you what, boys,&quot; said Bob Short, suddenly remembering his sentence,
                        &quot;don&apos;t let&apos;s do nothin&apos; that&apos;ll git us into no
                        trouble arterwards. Ef we blow up the school-house we&apos;ll be &apos;rested fer bigamy

                    <p>&quot;For larson,&quot; said Bill Day, hardly able to restrain another whoop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, &apos;taint larson,&quot; said Bob Short, looking wiser than a
                        chief-justice, &quot;it&apos;s arsony. Now I say, don&apos;t let&apos;s go to
                        penitentiary for nono larsonno arsony, I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Haoop!&quot; said Bill. &quot;Let&apos;s do something ludikerous. <pb

                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t mind,&quot; grinned Norman Anderson, delighted at the turn
                        things had taken. &quot;I&apos;d just like to see him hung.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So would I,&quot; said Bill Day, leaning over to Norman. &quot;Ef a Dutchman

                    <p>&quot;He&apos;d be a fool ef he did,&quot; piped Jim West. For Bill Day&apos;s
                        sister was a &quot;maid not vendible,&quot; as Shakespeare has it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;See yer,&quot; said Bill, trying in vain to draw his coat. &apos;&apos;

                        &quot;I was talkin&apos; agin the Dutch.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, that&apos;sh all right. Haoop! Boys, let&apos;s do somethin&apos;,
                        larson or arsony orsomething&quot;</p>
                    <p>A bucket of tar and some feathers were bought, for which young Anderson was made to pay, and Bill
                        Day insisted on buying fifteen feet of rope. &quot;Bekase,&quot; as he said,
                        &quot;arter you git the feathers on the &quot;bird, you mayyou may want to help him to
                        go to roosht you know, on a hickory limb. Haoop! Come along, boys; I say let&apos;s do
                        somethin&apos; ludikerous, ef it&apos;s nothin&apos; but a little larson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And so they went galloping down the road, nine drunken fools. For it is one of the beauties of
                        lynch law, that, however justifiable it may seem in some instances, it always opens the <pb
                            id="VAA2341-148" n="159"/> way to villainous outrages. Some of my readers will protest that
                        a man was never lynched for the crime of being a Dutchman. Which only shows how little they know
                        of the intense prejudice and lawless violence of the early West. Some day people will not
                        believe that men have been killed in California for being Chinamen.</p>
                    <p>Of the nine who started, one, the drunkest, fell off and broke his arm; the rest rode tip in
                        front of the cabin of Gottlieb Wehle. I do not want to tell how they alarmed the mother at her
                        late sewing and dragged Gottlieb&apos; out of his bed. I shudder now when I recall one such
                        outrage to which I was an unwilling witness. Norman threw the rope round Gottlieb&apos;s
                        neck and declared for hanging. Bill Day agreed. It would be so ludikerous, you know!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vot hash I tun? Hey? Vot vor you dries doo hanks me already, hey?&quot; cried the
                        honest German, who was willing enough to have the end of the world come, but who did not like
                        the idea of ascending alone, and in this fashion.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Wehle pushed her way into the mob and threw the rope off her husband&apos;s neck, and
                        began to talk with vehemence in German. For a moment the drunken fellows hung back out of
                        respect for a woman. Then Bill Day was suddenly impressed with the fact that the duty of
                        persuading Mrs. Wehle to consent to her husband&apos;s execution devolved upon him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take keer, boys; let me talk to the ole woman. I&apos;ll argy the case.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t speak Dutch no more nor a hoss can,&quot; squeaked Jeems West.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blam&apos;d ef I can&apos;t, though. Hyer, ole woman, firshta Dutch?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-149" n="160"/>
                    <p>&quot;Ya.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Bill, turning to the others in triumph, &quot;what did I tell
                        you? &quot;Well, you see, your boy August is a thief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s not a teef!&quot; said the old man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shet up your jaw. I say he is. Now, your ole man&apos;s got to be hung.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vot vor?&quot; broke in Gottlieb.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bekase it&apos;s all your own fault. You hadn&apos;t orter be a
                        Dutchman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here the crowd fell into a wrangle. It was not so easy to hang a man when such a woman stood
                        there pleading for him. Besides, Bob Short insisted that hanging was arsony in the first degree,
                        and they better not do it. To this Bill Day assented. He said he &apos;sposed tar and
                        feathers was only larson in the second degree. And then it would be rale hidikerous. And now
                        confused cries of &quot;Bring on the tar!&quot; &quot;Where&apos;s the
                        feathers?&quot; &quot;Take off his clothes!&quot; began to be raised. Norman stood
                        out for hanging. Drink always intensified his meanness. But the tar couldn&apos;t be found.
                        The man whom they had left lying by the roadside with a broken arm had carried the tar, and had
                        been well coated with it himself in his fall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ha-oop!&quot; shouted Bill Day. &quot;Let&apos;s do somethin&apos;.
                        Dog-on the arsony! Let&apos;s hang him as high as Dan&apos;el.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And with that the rope was thrown over Gottlieb&apos;s neck and he was hurried off to the
                        nearest tree. The rope was then put over a limb, and a drunken half-dozen got ready to pull,
                        while Norman Anderson adjusted the noose and valiant Bill Day undertook to keep off Mrs. Wehle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All ready! Pull up! Ha-oop!&quot; shouted Bill Day, and the crowd pulled, but Mrs.
                        Wehle had slipped off the noose again, <pb id="VAA2341-150" n="161"/> and the volunteer
                        executioners fell overone another in such a way as to excite the derisive laughter of Bill Day,
                        who thought it perfectly ludikerous. But before the laugh had finished, the indignant Gottlieb
                        had knocked Bill Day over and sent Norman after him. The blow sobered them a little, and
                        suddenly destroyed Bill&apos;s ambition to commit &quot;arsony,&quot; or do anything
                        else ludikerous. But Norman was furious, and under his lead Wehle&apos;s arms were now bound
                        with the rope and a consultation was held, during which little &quot;Wilhelmina pleaded for
                        her father effectively, and more by her tears and cries and the wringing of her chubby hands
                        than by any words. Bill Day said he be blamed ef that little Dutch gal&apos;s
                        takin&apos; on so didn&apos;t kinder make him feel sorter scrimpshous you know. But the
                        mob could not quit without doing something. So it was resolved to give Gottlieb a good ducking
                        in the river and send him into Kentucky past Andrew&apos;s castle to the river. Mrs. Wehle
                        followed, believing that her husband would be drowned, and little Wilhelmina ran and pulled the
                        alarm and awakened the Backwoods Philosopher, who soon threw himself among them, but too late to
                        dissuade them from their purpose, for Andrew&apos;s own skiff, the
                        &quot;Grisilde&quot; by name, with three of the soberest of the party, had already set
                        out to convey Wehle, after one hasty immersion, to the other shore, while the rest stood round
                        hallooing like madmen to prevent any alarm that &quot;Wehle might raise attracting attention
                        on the other side.</p>

                        Wilhelmina insisted on going with him, and as she handled a steering-oar well he took her along.
                        They found Gottlieb with his arms cruelly pinioned sitting on a log in a state of utter

                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll get that in due time, my friend,&quot; said Andrew, untying the
                        rope with which Gottlieb had been pinioned.&quot; Come, let us go back to our own

                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;ll take care of that,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;Before to-morrow

                    <p>It took much entreaty on the part of Andrew and much weeping and kissing on the part of
                        Wilhelmina to move the heart of the terrified Gottlieb. At last he got into the skiff and
                        allowed himself to be rowed back again, declaring all the way that he nebber zee no zich a vrce

                    <p>&quot;When Bill Day and his comrades got up the next morning and began to think of the
                        transactions of the night, they did not seem nearly so ludikerous as they had at the tune. And
                        when Norman Anderson and Bill Day and Bob Short read the notice on the door of
                        Mandluff&apos;s store they felt that &quot;arsony&quot; might have a serious as well
                        as a ludikerous side.</p>
                    <p>Andrew at first intended to institute proceedings against the rioters, but he knew that the law
                        was very uncertain against bear, and the prejudices of the people against the Dutch. To
                        prosecute would be to provoke another riot. So he contented himself with this.</p>
                    <p rend="center">&quot;P<hi rend="sc">ROCLAMATION</hi>!</p>
                    <p>&quot;T<hi rend="sc">O WHOM IT MAY CONCERN</hi>: I have a list of eight men connected with
                        the riotous mob which broke into the house of Gottlieb Wehle, a peaceable and unoffending
                        citizen of the United States. The said eight <pb id="VAA2341-154" n="166"/> men proceeded to
                        commit an assault and battery on the person of the said Gottlieb Wehle, and even endeavored at
                        one time to take his life. And the said riotous conduct was the result of a conspiracy, and the
                        said assault with intent to kill was with malice aforethought. The said eight men, after having
                        committed grievous outrages upon him by dipping him in the water and by other means, warned the
                        said Wehle not to return to the State. Now, therefore, I give notice to all and several of those
                        concerned in these criminal proceedings that the said Wehle has returned by my advicc; and that
                        if so much as a hair of his head or a splinter of his property is touched I will appear against
                        said parties and will prosecute them until I secure the infliction of the severest penalties
                        made and provided for the punishment of such infamous crimes. I hope I am well enough known here
                        to render it certain that if I once begin proceedings nothing but success or my death or the end
                        of the world can stop them.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">A CHAPTER OF BETWEENS.</head>
                    <p>D<hi rend="sc">ID</hi> you ever move? And, in moving, did you ever happen to notice how many
                        little things there are to be picked up? Now that I am about to shift the scene of my story from
                        Clark township, the narrow stage upon which it has progressed through two dozen chapters, I find
                        a great number of little things to be picked up.</p>
                    <p>One of the little things to be picked up is Norman Anderson. Very little, if measured soul-wise.
                        When his father had read the proclamation of Andrew and divined that Norman was interested in
                        the riot, he became thoroughly indignant; the more so, that he felt his own lack of power to do
                        anything in the premises against his wife. But when Mrs. Abigail heard of the case she was in
                        genuine distress. It showed Andrew&apos;s vindictiveness. He would follow her forever with
                        his resentments, just because she could not love him. It was not her fault that she did not love
                        him. Poor Norman had to suffer all the persecutions that usually fall to such innocent
                        creatures. She must send him away from home, though it broke her <pb id="VAA2341-156" n="168"/>
                        mother&apos;s heart to do it; for if Andrew didn&apos;t have him took up, the old
                        Dutchman would, just because his son had turned out a burglar. She said burglar rather
                        emphatically, with a look at Julia.</p>
                    <p>And so Samuel Anderson took his son to Louisville, and got him a place in a commission and
                        produce house on the levee, with which Mr. Anderson had &quot;business influence. And Samuel
                        warned him that he must do his &quot;best, for he could not come back home now without
                        danger of arrest, and Norman made many promises of amendment; so many, that his future seemed to
                        him barren of all delight. And, by way of encouraging himself in the austere life upon which, he
                        had resolved to enter, he attended the least reputable place of amusement in the city, the first
                        night after his father&apos;s departure.</p>
                    <p>In Clark township the Millerite excitement was at white heat. Some of the preachers in other
                        parts of the country had set one day, some another. I believe that Mr. Miller, the founder,
                        never had the temerity to set a day. But his followers figured the thing more closely, and Elder
                        Hanking had put a fine point on the matter. He was certain, for his part, that the time was at
                        midnight on the eleventh of August. His followers became very zealous, and such is the nature of
                        an infection, that scarcely anybody was able to resist it. Mrs. Anderson, true to her excitable
                        temper, became fanaticdreaming dreams, seeing visions, hearing voices, praying twenty times a
                            day,<ref id="ref_002" rend="super" target="note_002" targOrder="U">*</ref> wearing a sourly

                        Jonas declared that ef the noo airth and the noo heaven was to be chockful of sech as she,
                        &apos;most any other place&apos; in the univarse would be better, akordin&apos; to
                        his way of thinkin&apos;. He said she repented more of other folkses&apos; sins than
                        anybody he ever seed.<note id="note_002" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            <p>Mrs. Anderson was less devout than some of heir co-religionists; the wife of a well-known
                                steamboat-clerk was accustomed to pray in private fifty times a day, hoping by means of
                                this praying without ceasing to be found ready &quot;when the trumpet should
                            sound.</p>
                        </note>
                    </p>
                    <p>As summer came on, Samuel Anderson, borne away on the tide of his own and his wife&apos;s
                        fanatical fever of sublimated devotion, discharged Jonas and all his other <hi rend="i"
                        >employes</hi>, threw up business, and gave his whole attention to the straightening of his
                        accounts for the coming day of judgment. Before Jonas left to seek a new place he told Cynthy
                        Ann as how as ef he&apos;d a met her airlier &apos;twould a-settled his coffee fer life.
                        He was gittin&apos; along into the middle of the week now, but he&apos;d come to feel
                        like a boy sence he&apos;d been a livin&apos; where he could have a few sweet and
                        pleasant wordsahem!he thought December&apos;d be as pleasant as May all the year round ef he
                        could live in the aurora borealis of her countenance. And Cynthy Ann enjoyed his words so much
                        that she prayed for forgiveness for the next week and confessed in class-meeting that she had
                        yielded to temptation and sot her heart on the things of this perishin&apos; world. She was
                        afeared she hadn&apos;t always remembered&quot; as how as she was a poor unworthy
                        dyin&apos; worm of the dust, and that all the beautiful things in this world perished with
                        the usin&apos;.</p>
                    <p>And Brother Goshorn, the class-leader at Harden&apos;s CrossRoads, exhorted her to tear every
                        idol from, her heart. And still the sweet woman&apos;s nature, God&apos;s divine law
                        revealed in her heart, did assert itself a little. She planted some pretty-by-nights in an old
                        cracked blue-and-white tea-pot and set it on her window-sill. Somehow the pretty-by-nights would
                        remind her of Jonas, and while she tried to forget him with one half of her <pb id="VAA2341-158"
                            n="170"/> nature, the other and better part (the depraved part, she would have told you)
                        cherished the memory of his smallest act and word. In fact, the flowers had no association with
                        Jonas except that along with the awakening of her love came this little sentiment for flowers
                        into the dry desert of her life. But one day Mrs, Anderson discovered the old blue broken
                        tea-pot with its young plants.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Cynthy Annl&quot; she cried, &quot;a body&apos;d think you&apos;d
                        have more sense than, to do such, a soft thing as to be raisin&apos; posies at <hi rend="i"
                            >your</hi> time of life! And that when the world is drawing to a close, too! You&apos;ll
                        be one of the foolish virgins with no oil to your lamp, as sure as you see that day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As for Julia&apos;s flowers, Mrs. Anderson had rudely thrown them into the road by way of
                        removing temptation from her and turning her thoughts toward the awful realities of the close of
                        time.</p>
                    <p>But Cynthy Ann blushed and repented, and kept her broken tea-pot, with a fearful sense of sin in
                        doing so. She never watered the pretty-by-nights without the feeling that she was offering
                        sacrifice to an idol.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was natural enough, that the &quot;mud-clerk&quot; on the old
                        steamboat latan should take a fancy to the &quot;striker,&quot; as the
                        engineer&apos;s apprentice was called. Especially since the striker knew so much more than
                        the mud-clerk, and was able to advise him about many things. A striker with so much, general
                        information was rather a, novelty, and all the officers fancied him, except Sam Munson, the
                        second engineer, who had a natural jealousy of a striker that knew more than he did.</p>
                    <p>The striker had learned rapidly, and was trusted to stand a regular watch. The first engineer and
                        the third were together, and the second engineer and the striker took the other watch. The boat
                        in this way got the services of a competent engineer while paying him only a striker&apos;s
                        wage.</p>
                    <p>About the time the heavily-laden latan turned out of the Mississippi into the Ohio at Cairo at
                        six in the evening, the striker went off watch, and he ought to have gone to bed to prepare
                        himself for the second watch of the night, especially as he would only have the dog-watch
                        between that and the forenoon. But a passenger had got aboard at Cairo, whose face was familiar.
                            <pb id="VAA2341-160" n="172"/> The sight of it had aroused a throng of old associations,
                        pleasant and unpleasant, and a throng of emotions the most tender and the most wrathful the
                        striker had ever felt. Sleep he could not, and so, knowing that the mud-clerk was on watch, he
                        sought the office after nine o&apos;clock, and stood outside the bar talking to his friend,
                        who had little to do, since most of the freight had been shipped through, and his bills for
                        Paducah were all ready. The striker talked with the mud-clerk, but watched the throng of
                        passengers who drank with each other at the bar, smoked in the &quot;social hall,&quot;
                        read and wrote at the tables in the gentlemen&apos;s cabin, or sat with doffed hats and
                        chatted gallantly in the ladies&apos; cabin, which was visible as a distant
                        &quot;background, seen over a long row of tables with green covers and under a long row of
                        gilded wooden stalactites, which were intended to be ornamental. The little pendent prisms
                        beneath the chandeliers rattled gayly as the boat trembled at each stroke of her wheels, and
                        gaping backwoodsmen, abroad for the first tune, looked at all the rusty gingerbread-work, and
                        wondered if kings were able to afford anything half so fine as the cabin of the
                        &quot;palatial steamer Iatan,&quot; as she was described on the bills. The confused
                        murmur&quot; of many voices, mixed with the merry tinkling &quot;of the glass pendants,
                        gave the whole an air of excitement.</p>
                    <p>But the striker did not see the man he was looking for.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who got on at Cairo? I think I saw a man from our part of the country,&quot; he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I declare, I don&apos;t know,&quot; said the mud-clerk, who drawled his words
                        in a cold-blooded way. &quot;Let me look. Here&apos;s. A. Robertson, and T. Le Fevre,
                        and L. B. Sykes, and N. Anderson.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is Anderson going?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Paid through to Louisville. Do you know him?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-161" n="173"/>
                    <p>But just then Norman Anderson himself walked in, and went up to the bar with a new acquaintance.
                        They did not smoke the pipe of peace, like red Americans, but, like white Americans, they had a
                        mysterious liquid carefully compounded, and by swallowing this they solemnly sealed their
                        new-made friendship after the curious and unexplained rite in use among their people.</p>
                    <p>Norman had been dispatched on a collecting trip, and having nine hundred and fifty dollars in his
                        pocket, he felt as much elated as if it had been his own money. The gentleman with whom he
                        drank, had a band of crape around his white hat. He seemed very near-sighted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If that greeny is a friend of yours, Gus, I declare you&apos;d better tell him not
                        to tie to the serious-looking young fellow in the white hat and gold specs, unless he means to
                        part with all his loose change before bed-time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That is what the mud-clerk drawled to August the striker, but the striker seemed to hear the
                        words as something spoken afar off. For just then he was seeing a vision of a drunken mob, and a
                        rope, and a pleading woman, and a brave old man threatened with death. Just then he heard harsh
                        and muddled, voices, rude oaths, and jeering laughter, and above it all the sweet pleading of a
                        little girl begging for a father&apos;s life. And the quick blood came into his fair German
                        face, and he felt that he could not save this Norman Anderson from the toils of the gambler,
                        though he might, if provoked, pitch him over the guard of the boat. For was not
                        Andrew&apos;s letter, which described the mob, in his pocket, and burning a hole in his
                        pocket as it had been ever since he received it?</p>
                    <p>But then this was Julia&apos;s brother, and there was nothing he <pb id="VAA2341-162" n="174"
                        /> would not do for Julia. So, sometime after the mud-clerk had ceased to speak, the striker
                        gave utterance to both impulses by replying, &quot;He&apos;s no friend of
                        mine,&quot; a little crisply, and then softly adding,&quot; Though I shouldn&apos;t
                        like to see him fleeced.&quot;</p>
                    <p>By this time a new actor had appeared on the scene in the person of a man with a black mustache
                        and side-whiskers, who took a seat behind a card-table near the bar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;H&apos;llo!&quot; said the mud-clerk in a low and lazy voice, &quot;Parkins
                        is back again. After his scrape at Paducah last February, he disappeared, and he&apos;s been
                        shady ever since. He&apos;s growed whiskers since, so&apos;s not to be recognized. But
                        he&apos;ll be skeerce enough when we get to Paducah. Now, see how quick he&apos;ll catch
                        the greenies, won&apos;t you?&quot; The prospect was so charming as almost to stimulate
                        the mud-clerk to speak with some animation.</p>
                    <p>But August Wehle the striker on the Iatan, had an uncomfortable feeling that he had seen that
                        face before, and that the long mustache and side-whiskers had grown in a remarkably short space
                        of time. Could it be that there were two men who could spread a smile over the lower half of
                        their faces in that automatic way, while the spider-eyes had no sort of sympathy with it?
                        Surely, this man with black whiskers and mustache was not just like the singing-master at
                        Sugar-Grove schoolhouse, who had&quot; red-top hay on to his upper lip,&quot; and yetand

                        to play a little game just for the fun of the thing. It is a trick with, three cards. I put down
                        three cards, face up. Here is sis of diamonds, eight of spades, and the ace Of hearts. Now, I
                        will turn them over so quickly that I will <pb id="VAA2341-163" n="175"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-164" n="177"/> defy any of you to tell which is the ace. Do you see? How, I
                        would like to bet the wine for the company that no gentleman here can turn up the ace. All I
                        want is a little sport. Something to pass away the evening and amuse the company. Who will bet
                        the wine? The Scripture says that the hand is quicker than the eye, and I warn you that if you
                        bet, you will probably lose.&quot; And here he turned the cards back, with their faces up,
                        and the card which everybody felt sure was the ace proved apparently to be that card. Most of
                        the on-lookers regretted that they had not bet, seeing that they would certainly have won. Again
                        the cards were put face down, and the company was bantered to bet the wine. Nobody would bet.</p>
                    <p>After a good deal of fluent talk, and much dexterous handling of the cards, in a way that seemed
                        clear enough, to everybody, and that showed that everybody&apos;s guess was right as to the
                        place of the ace, the near-sighted gentleman, who had drunk with Norman, offered to bet five
                        dollars.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Five dollars!&quot; returned Parkins, laughing in derision, &quot;five dollars!
                        Do you think I&apos;m a gambler? I don&apos;t want any gentleman&apos;s money.
                        I&apos;ve got all the money I need. However, if you would like to bet the wine with me, I am
                        agreed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The near-sighted gentleman declined to wager anything but just the five dollars, and Parkins
                        spurned his proposition with the scorn of a gentleman who would on no account bet a cent of
                        money. But he grew excited, and bantered the whole crowd. &quot;Was there no <hi rend="i"
                            >gentleman</hi> in the crowd who would lay a wager of wine for the company on this
                        interesting little trick? It was strange to him that no gentleman had spirit enough, to make the
                        bet. But no gentleman had spirit enough to bet the wine. Evidently there were no gentlemen in
                        the company.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-165" n="178"/>
                    <p>However, the near-sighted man with the white hat adorned with crape now proposed in a crusty tone
                        to bet ten dollars that he could lift the ace. He even took out a ten-dollar bill, and, after
                        examining it, in holding it close to his nose as a penurious man might, extended his hand with,
                        &quot;If you&apos;re in earnest, let&apos;s know it. I&apos;ll bet you
                        ten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this Parkins grew furious. He had never been so persistently badgered in all his life.
                        He&apos;d have the gentleman know that he was not a gambler. He had all the money he wanted,
                        and as for betting ten dollars, he shouldn&apos;t think of it. But now that the gentlemanhe
                        said <hi rend="i">gentleman</hi> with an emphasisnow that the gentleman seemed determined to bet
                        money, he would show him that he was not to be backed down. If the young man would like to wager
                        a hundred dollars, he would cheerfully bet with him. If the gentleman did not feel able to bet a
                        hundred dollars, he hoped he would not say any more about it. He hadn&apos;t intended to bet
                        money at all. But he wouldn&apos;t bet less than a hundred dollars with anybody. A man who
                        couldn&apos;t afford to lose a hundred dollars, ought not to bet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is this fellow in the white hat with spectacles?&quot;. August asked of the
                        mud-clerk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is Smith, Parkin&apos;s partner. He is only splurging round to start up the
                        greenies.&quot; And the mud-clerk spoke with an indifference and yet a sort of <hi rend="i"
                            >dilettante</hi> interest in the game that shocked his friend, the striker.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t they set these blacklegs ashore?&quot; said August, whose love
                        of justice was strong.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You tell,&quot; drawled the mnd-clerk. &quot;The first clerk&apos;s tried
                        it, but the old man protects &apos;em, and&quot; (in a whisper) &quot;get&apos;s
                        his share, I guess. He can set them off whenever he wants to.&quot; (I <pb id="VAA2341-166"
                            n="179"/> must explain that there is only one &quot;old man&quot; on a steamboat
                        that is, the captain.)</p>
                    <p>By this time Parkins had turned and thrown his cards so that everybody knew or thought he knew
                        where the ace was. Smith, the man with the white hat, now rose five dollars more and offered to
                        bet fifteen. But Parkins was more indignant than ever. He told Smith to go away. He thrust his
                        hand into his pocket and drew out a handful of twenty-dollar gold-pieces. &quot;If any
                        gentleman wants to bet a hundred dollars, let him come on. A man who couldn&apos;t lose a
                        hundred would better keep still.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Smith now made a big jump. He&apos;d go fifty. Parkins wouldn&apos;t listen, to fifty. He
                        had said that he wouldn&apos;t bet less than a hundred, and he wouldn&apos;t. He now
                        pulled out handful after handful of gold, and piled the double-eagles up like a fortification in
                        front of him, while the crowd surged with excitement,</p>
                    <p>At last Mr. Smith, the near-sighted gentleman in spectacles, the gentleman who wore black crape
                        on a white hat, concluded to bet a hundred dollars. He took out his little portemonnaie and
                        lifted thence a hundred-dollar bill.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said he angrily, &quot;I&apos;ll bet you a hundred.&quot;
                        And he laid down the bill. Parkins piled five twenty-dollar gold-pieces atop it. Each man felt
                        that he could lift the ace in a moment. That card at the dealer&apos;s right was certainly
                        the ace. Norman was sure of it. He wished it had been his wager instead of Smith&apos;s. But
                        Parkins stopped Smith a moment.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, young man,&quot; he said, &quot;if you don&apos;t feel perfectly able
                        to lose that hundred dollars, you&apos;d better take it back.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am just aa able to lose it as you are,&quot; said Smith snappishly, and to
                        everybody&apos;s disappointment he lifted not the card everybody had fixed on, but the
                        middle one, and so lost his money.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-167" n="180"/>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you take the other?&quot; said Norman boastfully. &quot;I
                        knew it was the ace.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you bet, then?&quot; said Smith, grinning a little. Norman
                        wished he had. But he had not a hundred dollars of his own, and he had scruplesfaint, and yet
                        scruples, or rather alarmsat the thought of risking his employer&apos;s money on a wager.
                        While he was &quot;weighing motive against motive, Smith bet again, and again, to
                        Norman&apos;s vexation, selected a card that was so obviously wrong that Norman thought it a
                        pity that so near-sighted a man should bet and lose. He wished he had a hundred dollars of his
                        own and There,&apos; Smith was betting again. This time he consulted Norman before making
                        his selection, and of course turned up the right card, remarking that he wished his eyes were so
                        keen! He would win a thousand dollars before bed-tune if his eyes were so good! Then he took
                        Norman into partnership, and Norman found himself suddenly in possession of fifty dollars,
                        gotten without trouble. This turned his brain. Nothing is so intoxicating to a weak man as money
                        acquired without toil. So Norman continued to bet, sometimes independently, sometimes in
                        partnership with the gentlemanly Smith. He was borne on by the excitement of varying fortune, a
                        varying fortune absolutely under control of the dealer, whose sleight-of-hand was perfect. And
                        the varying fortune had an unvarying tendency in the long runto put three stakes out of five
                        into the pockets of the gamblers, who found the little game very interesting amusement for
                        gentlemen.</p>

                        weak-headed victim, into their toils, what was August doing? Where were his prompt decision of
                        character, hia quick intelligence, his fine German perseverance, that should have saved the
                        brother of Julia Anderson from, harpies? Could our blue-eyed young countryman, who knew how to
                        cherish noble aspirations walking in a plowman&apos;s furrowcould he stand there satisfying
                        his revenge by witnessing the rum of &quot;a young man who, like many others, was wicked
                        only because he was weak?</p>
                    <p>&quot;In truth, August was a man whose feelings were persistent. His resentment waslike his
                        loveconstant. But his love of justice was higher and more persistent, and he could not have seen
                        any one fleeced in this merciless way without taking sides strongly with the victim. Much less
                        could he see the brother of Julia tempted on to the rocks by the false lights of villainous
                        wreckers without a great desire to save him. For the letter of Andrew had ceased now to burn in
                        his pocket. That other letterthe only one that Julia had been able to send through Cynthy <pb
                            id="VAA2341-169" n="182"/> Ann and Jonasthat other letter, written all over with such tender
                        extravagances as love feeds on; the thought of that other letter, which told how beautiful and
                        precious were the invitations to the weary and heavy-laden, had stilled resentment, and there
                        came instead a keen desire to save Norman for the sake of Julia and justice. But how to do it
                        was an embarrassing questiona question that was more than August could solve. There was a
                        difficulty in the weakness and wrong-headedness of Norman; a difficulty in Norman&apos;s
                        prejudice against Dutchmen in general and August in particular; a difficulty in the fact that
                        August was a sort of a fugitive, if not from justice, certainly from injustice.</p>
                    <p>But when nearly a third of Norman&apos;s employer&apos;s money had gone into the
                        gamblers&apos; heap, and when August began to understand that it was another man&apos;s
                        money that Norman was losing, and that the victim was threatened by no half-way ruin, he
                        determined to do something, even at the risk of making himself known to Norman and to Parkinswas
                        he Humphreys in disguise?and at the risk of arrest for house-breaking. August acted with his
                        eyes open to all the perils from gamblers&apos; pistols and gamblers&apos; malice; and
                        after he had started to interfere, the mud-clerk called him back, and said, in his
                        half-indifferent way:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here, Gus, don&apos;t be a blamed fool. That&apos;s a purty little game.
                        That greeny&apos;s got to learn to let blacklegs alone, and he don&apos;t look like one
                        that&apos;ll take advice. Let him scorch a little; it&apos;ll do him good. It&apos;s
                        healthy for young men. That&apos;s the reason the old man don&apos;t forbid it, I
                        s&apos;pose. And these fellows carry good shooting-irons with hair-triggers, and I declare I
                        don&apos;t want to be bothered writing home to your mother, and <pb id="VAA2341-170" n="183"

                        bird out of the trap in which he goes snucks; you will, I declare. And you&apos;ll get
                        walking-papers at Louisville. Let the game alone. You haven&apos;t got any hand to play
                        against Parkins, nohow; and I reckon the greenhorns are <figure entity="VAA2341-26">

                    <p>August stopped long enough to take in the full measure of his sacrifice. So far from being
                        deterred by it, he was more than ever determined to act. Not the love of Julia, so much, now,
                        but the farewell prayer and benediction and the whole life and spirit of the sweet Moravian
                        mother in her child-full house at home were in his mind at this moment. Things which a man will
                        not do for the love of woman he may do for <pb id="VAA2341-171" n="184"/> the love of Godand it
                        was with a sense of moral exaltation that August entered into the lofty spirit of self-sacrifice
                        he had seen in his mother, and caught himself saying, in his heart, as he had heard her say,
                        &quot;Let us do anything for the Father&apos;s sake!&quot; Some will call this cant.
                        So much the worse for them. This motive, too little felt in our daytoo little felt in any dayis
                        the great impulse that has enabled men to do the bravest things that have been done. The
                        sublimest self-sacrifice is only possible to a man by the aid of some strong moral tonic.
                        God&apos;s love is the chief support of the strongest spirits.</p>
                    <p>August touched Norman on the arm. The face of the latter expressed anything but pleasure at
                        meeting him, now that he felt guilty. But this was not the uppermost feeling with Norman. He
                        noticed that August&apos;s clothes were spotted with engine-grease, and his first fear was
                        of compromising hia respectability.</p>
                    <p>In a hurried way August began to explain to him that he was betting with gamblers, but Smith
                        stood close to them, looking at August in such a contemptuous way as to make Norman feel very
                        uncomfortable, and Parkins seeing the crowd attracted hy August&apos;s explanationswhich he
                        made in some detail, by way of adapting himself to Normanof the trick by which the upper card is
                        thrown out first, Parkins said, &quot;I see you un-. derstand the game, young man. If you
                        do, why don&apos;t you bet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>At this the crowd laughed, and Norman drew away from the striker&apos;s greasy clothes, and
                        said that he didn&apos;t want to speak any further to aburglar, he believed. But August
                        followed, determined to warn him against Smith. Smith was ahead of him, however, saying to
                        Norman, &quot;Look out for your pockets that greasy fellow will rob you.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-172" n="185"/>
                    <p>And Norman, who was nothing if not highly respectable, resolved to shake off the troublesome
                        &quot;Dutchman &quot;at once. &quot;I don&apos;t know what you are up to now,
                        but at home you are known as a thief. So pleaae let me alone, will you?&quot; This Norman
                        tried to say in an annihilating way.</p>
                    <p>The crowd looked for a fight. August said loud enough to be heard, &quot;You know very well
                        that you lie. I wanted to save you from being a thief, but you are betting money now that is not
                        yours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The company, of course, sympathized with the gentleman and against the machine-oil on the
                        striker&apos;s clothes, so that there arose quickly a murmur, started by Smith,
                        &quot;Put the bully out,&quot; and August was &quot;hustled.&quot; It is well
                        that he was not shot.</p>
                    <p>It was quite time for him to go on watch now; for the loudticking marine-clock over the window of
                        the clerk&apos;s office pointed to three minutes past twelve, and the striker hurried to his
                        post at the starboard engine, with the bitterness of defeat and the shame of insult in his
                        heart. He had sacrificed his place, doubtless, and risked much beside, and all for nothing. The
                        third engineer complained of his tardiness in not having relieved him three minutes before, and
                        August went to his duties with a bitter heart. To a man who is persistent, as August was, defeat
                        of any sort is humiliating.</p>
                    <p>As for Norman, he bet after this just to show his independence and to show that the money was his
                        own, as well as in the vain hope of winning back what he had lost. He bet every cent. Then he
                        lost his watch, and at half-past one o&apos;clock he went to his state-room, stripped of all
                        loose valuables, and sweating great drops. And the mud-clerk, who was still in the office,
                        remarked to himself, with a pleasant chuckle, that it was good for him; he <pb id="VAA2341-173"
                            n="186"/> declared it was; teach the fellow to let monte alone, and keep his eyes peeled
                        when he traveled. It would so!</p>
                    <p>The idea was a good one, and he went down to the starboard engine and told the result of the nice
                        little game to his friend the striker, drawling it out in a relishful way, how the blamed idiot
                        never stopped till they&apos;d got his watch, and then looked like as if he&apos;d a
                        notion to jump into the &quot;drink.&quot; But &apos;twould cure him of
                        meddliu&apos; with monte. It would so!</p>
                    <p>He walked away, and August was just reflecting on the heartlessness of his friend, when the
                        mud-clerk came back again, and began drawling his words out as before, just as though each
                        distinct word were of a delightful flavor and he regretted that he must part with it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got you even with Parkins, old fellow. He&apos;ll be strung up on a
                        lamp-post at Paducah, I reckon. I saw a Paducah man aboard, and I put a flea in his ear.
                        &quot;We&apos;ve got to lay there an hour or two to put off a hundred barrels of
                        molasses and two hundred sacks of coffee and two lots of plunder. There&apos;ll be a hot
                        time for Parkins. He let on to marry a girl and fooled her. They&apos;ll teach him a lesson.
                        You&apos;ll be off watch, and we&apos;ll have some fun looking on.&quot; And the
                        mud-clerk evidently thought that it would be even funnier to see Parkins hanged than it had been
                        to see him fleece Norman. Gus the striker did not see how either scene could be very
                        entertaining. But he was sick at heart, and one could not expect him to show much interest in
                        manly sports.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> steady beat of the wheels and the incessant Clank of the engines went on
                        as usual. The boat was loaded almost to her guards, and did not make much speed. The wheels kept
                        their persistent heat upon the water, and the engines kept their rhythmical clangor going, until
                        August found himself getting drowsy. Trouble, with forced inaction, nearly always has a
                        soporific tendency, and a continuous noise is favorable to sleep. Once or twice August roused
                        himself to a sense of his responsibility and battled with his heaviness. It was nearing the end
                        of his watch, for the dog-watch of two hours set in at four o&apos;clock. But it seemed to
                        him that four o&apos;clock would never come.</p>
                    <p>An incident occurred just at this moment that helped him to keep his eyes open. A man went aft
                        through the engine-room with a red handkerchief tied round his forehead. In spite of this
                        partial disguise August perceived that it was Parkins. He passed through to the place where the
                        steerage or deck passengers are, and then disappeared from August&apos;s sight. He had meant
                        to disembark at a wood-yard just below Paducah, but for <pb id="VAA2341-175" n="188"/>
                        some&apos;reason the boat did not stop, and now, as August guessed, he was hiding himself
                        from Paducah eyes. He was not much too soon, for the great bell on the hurricane-deck was
                        already ringing for Paducah, and the summer dawn was showing itself faintly through the river
                        fog.</p>
                    <p>The alarm-bell rang in the engine-room, and Wehle stood by his engine. Then the bell rang to stop
                        the starboard engine, and August obeyed it. The pilot of a &quot;Western steamboat depends
                        much upon his engines for steerage in making a landing, and the larboard engine was kept running
                        a while longer in order to bring the deeply-loaded boat round to her landing at the primitive
                        wharf-boat of that day. There is something fine in the faith with which an engineer obeys the
                        bell of the pilot, not knowing what may be ahead, not inquiring wbat may be the effect of the
                        order, hut only doing exactly what he is bid when he is bid. August had stopped his engine, and
                        stood trying to keep his mind off Parkins and the events of the night, that he might be ready to
                        obey the nest signal for his engine. But the bell rang next to stop the other engine, at which
                        the second engineer stood, and August was so free from responsibility in regard to that that he
                        hardly noticed the sound of the bell, until it rang a second time more violently. Then he
                        observed that the larboard engine still ran. Was Munson dead or asleep? Clearly it was
                        August&apos;s duty to stand by his own engine. But then he was startled to think wbat damage
                        to property or life might take place from the failure of the second engineer to stop his engine.
                        While he hesitated, and all these considerations flashed through his mind, the pilot&apos;s
                        bell rang again long and loud, and August then, obeying an impulse rather than a conviction, ran
                        over to the other engine, stopped it, and then, considering that it had <pb id="VAA2341-176"
                            n="189"/> run so long against orders he reversed it and set it to backing without waiting
                        instructions. Then he seized Munson and woke him, and hurried back to his post. But the larboard
                        engine had not made three revolutions backward before the boat, hopelessly thrown from her
                        course by the previous neglect, struck the old wharf-boat and sunk it. But for the promptness
                        and presence of mind with which Wehle acted, the steamboat itself would have suffered severely.
                        The mate and then the captain came rushing into the engine-room. Munson was discharged at once,
                        and the striker was promised engineer&apos;s wages.</p>
                    <p>Gus went off watch at this moment, and the mud-clerk said to him, in his characteristically
                        indifferent voice, &quot;Such luck, I declare! I was sure you would be dismissed for
                        meddling with Parkins, and here you are promoted, I declare!&quot;</p>
                    <p>The mishap occasioned much delay to the boat, as it was very inconvenient to deliver freight at
                        that day and at that stage of water without the intervention of the wharf-boat. A full hour was
                        consumed in finding a landing, and in rigging the doublestaging and temporary planks necessary
                        to get the molasses and coffee and household &quot;plunder&quot; ashore. Some hint that
                        Parkins was on the river had already reached Paducah, and the sheriff and two deputies and a
                        small crowd were at the landing looking for him. A search of the boat failed to discover him,
                        and the crowd would have left the landing but for occasional hints slyly thrown out by the
                        mud-clerk as he went about over the levee collecting freight-bills. These hints, given in a
                        noncommittal way, kept the crowd alive with expectation, and when the rumors thus started spread
                        abroad, the levee was soon filled with an excited and angry multitude.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-177" n="190"/>
                    <p>If it had been a question of delivering a criminal to justice, August would not have hesitated to
                        tell the sheriff where to look. But he very well knew that the sheriff could not convey the man
                        through the mob alive, and to deliver even such, a scoundrel to the summary vengeance of a mob
                        was something that he could not find it in his heart to do.</p>
                    <p>In truth, the sheriff and his officers did not seek very zealously for their man. Under the
                        circumstances, it was probable he would not surrender himself without a fight, in which somebody
                        would be killed, and besides there must ensue a battle with the mob. It was what they called an
                        ugly job, and they were not loth to accept the captain&apos;s assurance that the gambler had
                        gone ashore.</p>
                    <p>While August was unwilling to deliver the hunted villain to a savage death, he began to ask
                        himself why he might not in some way use his terror in the interest of justice. For he had just
                        then seen the wretched and bewildered face of Norman looking ghastly enough in the fog of the
                        morning.</p>
                    <p>At last, full of this notion, and possessed, too, by his habit of accomplishing at all hazards
                        what he had begun, August strolled back through the now quiet engine-room to the
                        deck-passengers&apos; quarter. It was about half an hour before six o&apos;clock, when
                        the dog-watch would expire and he must go on duty again. In one of the uppermost of the filthy
                        bunks, in the darkest corner, near the wheel, he discovered what he thought to be his man. The
                        deck-passengers were still asleep, lying around stupidly. August paused a moment, checked by a
                        sense of the dangerousness of his undertaking. Then he picked up a stick of wood and touched the
                        gambler, who could not have been very sound asleep, lying in hearing of the curses of the mob on
                        the <pb id="VAA2341-178" n="191"/> shore. At first Parkins did not move, but August gave him a
                        still more vigorous thrust. Then he peered out between the blanket and the handkerchief over his
                        forehead.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will take that money you won last night from that young man, if you please.&quot;</p>
                    <figure entity="VAA2341-27">
                        <p rend="center">WAKING UP IN UGLY CUSTOMER.</p>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Parkins saw that it was useless to deny his identity. &quot;Do you want to be shot?&quot;
                        he asked fiercely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not any more than you want to be hung,&quot; said August. &quot;The one would
                        follow the other in five minutes. Give back that money and I will go away.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-179" n="192"/>
                    <p>The gambler trembled a minute. He was fairly at bay. He took out a roll of bills and handed it to
                        August. There was but five hundred. Smith had the other four hundred and fifty, he said. But
                        August had a quiet German steadiness of nerve. He said that unless the other four hundred and
                        fifty were paid at once he should call iu the sheriff or the crowd. Parkins knew that every
                        minute August stood there increased his peril, and human nature is now very much like human
                        nature in the days of Job. The devil understood the subject very well when he said that all that
                        a man hath will he give for his life. Parkins paid the four hundred and fifty in gold-pieces. He
                        &quot;would have paid twice that if August had demanded it.</p>

                    <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> a story such as I meant this to be, the development of character stands for
                        more than the evolution of the plot, and herein is the true significance of this contact of
                        Wehle with the gamblers, and, indeed, of this whole steamboat life. It is not enough for one to
                        be good in a country neighborhood; the sharp contemper to the character. August Wehle was hardly
                        the same fifty dollars in his pocket, that he had been the evening before, when he first felt
                        the sharp resentment against the man who had outraged his father. In acting on a high plane, one
                        is unconsciously lifted to that plane. Men become Christians sometimes from the effect of sudden
                        demands made upon their higher moral mature, demands which compel them to choose between a life
                        higher than their present living, or a moral degradation. Such had been August&apos;s
                        experience. He had been drawn upward toward God by the opportunity and necessity for heroic
                        action. I have no doubt the good Samaritan got more out of his own kindness than, the robbed Jew
                        did.</p>

                    <p>Before he had a chance to restore the money to its rightful owner, the two hours of dog-watch had
                        expired, and he was obliged to go on watch again, much to his annoyance. He had been nearly
                        twenty-four hours without sleep, and after a night of such excitement it was unpleasant as well
                        as perilous to have to hold this money, which did not belong to him, for six hours longer,
                        liable at any minute to get into difficulty through any scheme of the gamblers and their allies,
                        by which his recovery of the money might be misinterpreted. The morning seemed to wear away so
                        slowly. All the possibilities of Parkins&apos;s attacking him, of young Anderson&apos;s
                        committing suicide, and of the misconstruction that might be put upon his motivesthe making of
                        his disinterested action seem robberyhaunted his excitable imagination. At last, while the
                        engines were shoving their monotonous shafts backward and forward, and the &quot;palatial
                        steamer&quot; Iatan was slowly pushing her way up the stream, August grew so nervous over
                        his money that he resolved to relieve himself of part of it. So he sent for the mud-clerk by a
                        passing deck-hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to keep this money for me until I get off watch,&quot; said August.
                        &quot;I made Parkins stand and deliver this morning while we were at Paducah.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You did?&quot; said the mud-clerk, not offering to touch the money. &quot;You
                        risked your life, I declare, for that fool that called you a thief. You are a fool, Gus, and
                        nothing but your blamed good luck can save you from getting salivated, bright and early, some
                        morning. Not a great deal I won&apos;t take that money. I don&apos;t relish lead, and
                        I&apos;ve got to live among these fellows all my days, and Idon&apos;t hold that money
                        for anybody. The old man would ship me at Louisville, seeing I never stopped anybody&apos;s
                        engine and backed it in a hurry, as you did. If I&apos;d known where <pb id="VAA2341-182"
                            n="195"/> Parkins was, I&apos;d a dropped a gentle word in the ear of the crowd outside,
                        but 1 wouldn&apos;t a pulled that greeny&apos;s coffee-nuts out of the fire, and I
                        won&apos;t hold the hot things for you. I declare I won&apos;t. Saltpeter
                        wouldn&apos;t save me if I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So Gus had to content himself in his nervousness, not allayed by this speech, and keep the money
                        in his pocket until noon. And, after all the presentiment he had had, noon came round.
                        Presentiments generally come from the nerves, and signyfy nothing; but nobody keeps a tally of
                        the presentiments and auguries that fail. When the first-engineer and a new man tood the enties
                        at noon, Gus was advised by the former to get some sleep, but there was no sleep for him until
                        he had found Norman, who trembled at the sight of him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where is your state-room?&quot; said August sternly, for he couldn&apos;t bring
                        himself to speak kindly to the poor fellow, even in hia misery.</p>
                    <p>Norman turned pale. He had been thinking of suicide all the morning, but he was a coward, and now
                        he evidently felt sure that he was to be killed by August. He did not dare disobey, but led the
                        way, stopping to try to apologize two or three times, but never getting any further than
                        &quot;II&quot;</p>
                    <p>Once in the state-room, he sat down on the berth and gasped, &quot;II&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here is your money,&quot; said August, handing it to him. &quot;I made the
                        gambler give it up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;II&quot; said the astonished and bewildered Norman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t say a word. You are a cowardly scoundrel, and if you say anything,
                        I&apos;ll knock you down for treating my, father as you did. Only forforwell, I
                        didn&apos;t want to see you fleeced.&apos;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-183" n="196"/>
                    <p>Norman was ashamed for once, and hung his head. It touched the heart of August a little, but the
                        remembrance of the attack of the mob on his father made him feel hard again, and so his generous
                        act was performed ungraciously.</p>

                    <p>N<hi rend="sc">OT</hi> the boat. The boat ran on safely enough to Louisville, and tied up at the
                        leyee, and discharged her sugar and molasses, and took on a new cargo of baled hay and corn and
                        flour, and went back again, and made I know not how many trips, and ended her existence I can
                        not tell how or when. What does become of the old steamboats? The Iatan ran for years after she
                        tied up at Louisville that summer morning, and then perhaps she was blown up or burned up;
                        perchance some cruel sawyer transfixed her; perchance she was sunk by ice, or maybe she was
                        robbed of her engines and did duty as barge, or, what is more probable, she wore out like the
                        one-hogs shay, and just tumbled to pieces simultaneously.</p>
                    <p>It was not the gambler who got aground that morning. He had yet other nice little games, with
                        three cards or more or none, to play.</p>
                    <p>It was not the mud-clerk who ran agroundgood, non-committal soul, who never took sides where it
                        would do him any harm, and who never worried himself about anything. Dear, drawling, optimist
                        philosopher, who could see how other people&apos;s <pb id="VAA2341-185" n="198"/> mishaps
                        were best for them, and &quot;who took good care not to have any himself! It was not he that
                        ran aground.</p>
                    <p>It was not Norman Anderson who ran aground. He walked into the store with the proud and manly
                        consciousness of having done his duty, he made his returns of every cent of money that had come
                        into his hands, and, like all other faithful stewards, received the cordial commendation of his
                        master.</p>
                    <p>But August Wehle the striker, just when he was to be made an engineer, when he thought he had
                        smooth sailing, suddenly and provokingly found himself fast aground, with no spar or capstan by
                        which he might help himself off, with no friendly craft alongside to throw him a hawser and pull
                        him off.</p>
                    <p>It seems that when the captain promised him promotion, he did not know, anything of
                        August&apos;s interference with the gamhlers. But when Parkins filed his complaint, it
                        touched the captain. It was generally believed among the <hi rend="i">employes</hi> of the boat
                        that a percentage of gamblers&apos; gains was one of the &quot;old man&apos;s
                        &quot;perquisites, and he was not the only steamboat captain who profited by the nice little
                        games in the cabin upon which he closed both eyes. And this retrieved nine hundred and fifty
                        dollars was a dead loss ofwell, it does not matter how much, to the virtuous and highly
                        honorable captain. His proportion would have been large enough at least to pay his
                        wife&apos;s pewrent in St. James&apos;s Church, with a little something over for
                        charitable purposes. For the captain did not mind giving a disinterested twenty-five dollars
                        occasionally to those charities that were willing&apos; to show their gratitude by posting
                        his name as director, or his wife&apos;s as &quot;Lady Manageress.&quot; In this
                        case his right hand never knew what his left hand didhow it got the money, for instance.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-186" n="199"/>
                    <p>So when August drew his pay he was informed that he was discharged. No reason was given. He tried
                        to see the captain. But the captain was in the bosom of his family, kissing his own well-dressed
                        little boys, and enjoying the respect which only exemplary and provident fathers enjoy. And
                        never asking down in his heart if these boys might become gamblers&apos; victims, or
                        gamblers, indeed. The captain could not see August the striker, for he was at home, and must not
                        be interfered with by any of his subordinates. Besides, it was Sunday, and he could not be
                        intruded uponthe rector of St. James&apos;s was dining with him on his wife&apos;s
                        invitation, and it behooved him to walk circumspectly, not with eye-service as a man-pleaser,
                        but serving the Lord.</p>
                    <p>So he refused to see the anxious striker, and turned to compliment the rector on his admirable
                        sermon on the sin of Judas, who sold his master for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
                    <p>And August Wehle had nothing left to do. The river was falling fast, the large boats above the
                        Falls were, in steamboatman&apos;s phrase, &quot;laying up&quot; in the mouths of
                        the tributaries and other convenient, harbors, there were plenty of engineers unemployed, and
                        there were no vacancies.</p>

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">ONAS</hi> had been all his life, as he expressed it in his mixed rhetoric,
                        &quot;a wanderin&apos; sand-hill crane, makin&apos; many crooked paths, and, like
                        the cards in French monte, a-turain&apos; up suddently in mighty onexpected
                        places.&quot; He had been in every queer place from Halifax to Texas, and then had come hack
                        to his home again. Naturally cautious, and especially suspicious of the female sex, it is not
                        strange that he had not married. Only when he &quot;tied up to the same w&apos;arf-boat
                        alongside of Cynthy Ann, he thought he&apos;d found somebody as was to be depended on in a
                        fog or a harricane.&quot; This he told to Cynthy Ann as a reason why she should accept his
                        offer of marriage.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jonas,&quot; said Cynthy Ann, &quot;don&apos;t flatter. My heart is
                        dreadful weak, and prone to the vanities of this world. It makes me abhor myself in dust and
                        sackcloth fer you to say such things about poor unworthy me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ef I think &apos;em, why shouldn&apos;t I say &apos;em? I don&apos;t
                        know no law agin tellm&apos; the truth ef you git into a place where you can&apos;t no
                        ways help it. I don&apos;t call you angel, fer you a&apos;n&apos;t; you
                        ha&apos;nt got no wings nor feathers. I don&apos;t say as how as you&apos;re <pb
                            id="VAA2341-188" n="201"/> pertikeler knock-down handsome. I don&apos;t pertend that
                        you&apos;re a spring chicken. I don&apos;t lie nor flatter. I a&apos;n&apos;t
                        goin&apos; it blind, like young men in love. Bat I do say, with my eyes open and in my right
                        senses, and feelin&apos; solemn, like a man a-makin&apos; his last will and testament,
                        that they a&apos;n&apos;t no sech another woman to be found outside the leds of the
                        Bible betwixt the Bay of fundy and the Rio Grande. I&apos;ve &apos;sought round this
                        burdened airth,&apos; as the hymn says, and they a&apos;n&apos;t but jest one. Ef
                        that one&apos;ll jest make me bappy, I&apos;ll fold my weary pinions and settle down in
                        a rustic log-cabin and raise corn and potaters till death do us part.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Cyrithy trembled. Cynthy was a saint, a martyr to religious feeling, a medieval nun in her
                        ascetic eschewing of the pleasures of life. But Cynthy Ann was also a woman. And a woman. whose
                        spring-time had passed. When love buds out thus late, when the opportunity for the
                        woman&apos;s nature to blossom comes unexpectedly upon one at her age, the temptation is not
                        easily resisted. Cynlhy trembled, but did not quite yield up her Christian constancy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jonas, I don&apos;t know whether I&apos;d orto or not. I don&apos;t deny I
                        think I&apos;d better as brother Goshorn, you know, sence what would it profit ef I gained
                        you or any joy in this world, and then come short by settin&apos; you up fer a idol in my
                        heart? I don&apos;t know whether a New Light is a onbeliever or not, and whether
                        I&apos;d be onequally yoked or not. I must ax them as knows better nor I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, ef I&apos;m a onbeliever, they&apos;s nobody as could teach me to believe
                        quicker&apos;n you could. I never did believe much in women folks till I believed in
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that&apos;s the sin of it, Jonas. I&apos;d believe in you, and
                        you&apos;d believe in me, and we&apos;d be puttin&apos; our trust in the
                        creatur&apos; instid <pb id="VAA2341-189" n="202"/> of the Creator, and the Creator is
                        mighty jealous of our idols, and He would take us away fer idolatry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, but I wouldn&apos;t worship you, though I&apos;d rather worship you than
                        anybody else ef I was goin&apos; into the worshipin&apos; business. But you see I
                        a&apos;n&apos;t, honey. I wouldn&apos;t sacrifice to you no lambs nor sheep, I
                        wouldn&apos;t pray to you, nor I wouldn&apos;t kiss your shoes, like people does the
                        Pope&apos;s. An&apos; I know you wouldn&apos;t make no idol of me like them Greek
                        gods that Andrew&apos;s got picters of I a&apos;n&apos;t handsome enough by a long
                        shot fer a Jupiter or a &apos;Polio. An&apos; I tell you, Cynthy,
                        &apos;tain&apos;t no sin to love. Love is the fillfulling of the law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Cynthy Ann persisted that she must consult Brother Goshorn, the antiquated class-leader at
                        the cross-roads. Brother Goshorn was a good man, but Jonas had a great contempt for him. He was
                        a strainer out of gnats, though I do not think he swallowed camels. He always stood at the door
                        of the love-feast and kept out every woman with jewelry, every girl who had an
                        &quot;artificial&quot;in her bonnet, everyone who wore curls, every man whose hair was
                        beyond what he considered the regulation length of Scripture, and every woman who wore a veil.
                        In support of this last prohibition he quoted Isaiah iii, 28: &quot;The glasses and the fine
                        linen and the hoods and the veils.&quot;</p>
                    <p>To him Cynthy Ann presented the case with much trepidation. All her hopes for this world hung
                        upon it. But this consideration did not greatly affect Brother Goshorn. Hopes and joys were as
                        nothing to him where the strictness of discipline was involved. The Discipline meant more to a
                        mind of his cast than the Decalogue or the Beatitudes. He shook his head. He did not know. He
                        must consult Brother Hall. Now, Brother Hall was the young preacher traveling his second year,
                        very <pb id="VAA2341-190" n="203"/> young and very callow. Ten years of the sharp attritions of
                        a Methodist itinerant&apos;s life would take his unworldliness out of him and develop his
                        practical sense as no other school in the world could develop it. But as yet Brother Hall had
                        not rubbed off any of his sanctimoniousness, had not lost any of his belief that the universe
                        should be governed on high general principles with no exceptions.</p>
                    <p>So when Brother Goshorn informed him that one of his members, Sister Cynthy Ann Dyke, wished to
                        marry, and to marry a man that was a New Light, and had, asked his opinion, and that he did not
                        certainly know whether New Lights were believers or not, Brother Hall did not stop to inquire
                        what Jonas might be personally. He looked and felt very solemn, and said that it was a pity for
                        a Christian to marry a New Light. It was clearly a sin, for a New Light was an Arian. And an
                        Arian was just as good as ah infidel. An Arian robbed Christ of His supreme deity, and since he
                        did not worship the Trinity in the orthodox sense he must worship a false god. He was an
                        idolater therefore, and it was a sin to be yoked together with such an one.</p>
                    <p>Many men more learned than the callow but pious and sincere Brother Hall have left us in print
                        just such deductions.</p>
                    <p>When this decision was communicated to the scrupulous Cynthy Ann, she folded her hopes as one
                        lays away the garment of a dead friend; she went to her little room and prayed; she offered a
                        sacrifice to God not less costly than Abraham&apos;s, and in a like sublime spirit. She
                        watered the plant in the old cracked blue-and-white tea-pot, she noticed that it was just about
                        to bloom, and then she dropped one tear upon it, and because it suggested Jonas in some way. <pb
                            id="VAA2341-191" n="204"/> she threw it away, resolved not to have any idols in her heart.
                        And, doubtless, God received the sacrifice, mistaken and needless <figure entity="VAA2341-28">
                            <p rend="center">CYNTHY ANN&apos;S SACRIFICE.</p>
                        </figure> as it wag, a token of the faithfulness of her heart to her duty as she understood it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-192" n="205"/>
                    <p>Cynthy Ann explained it all to Jonas in a severe and irrevocable way. Jonas looked at her a
                        moment, stunned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did Brother Goshorn venture to send me any of his wisdom, in the way of advice,
                        layin&apos; round loose, like counterfeit small change, cheap as dirt?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Cynthy Ann, hesitating.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll bet the heft of my fortin&apos;, to be paid on receipt of the amount,
                        that I kin tell to a T what the good Christian wanted me to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be oncharitable, Jonas. Brother Goshorn is a mighty sincere
                        man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So he is, but his bein&apos; sincere don&apos;t do me no good. He wanted you to
                        advise me to jine the Methodist class as a way of gittin&apos; out of the difficulty. And
                        you was too good a Christian to ask me to change fer any seen reason, knowin&apos; I
                        wouldn&apos;t be fit for you ef I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Cynthy Ann was silent. She would have liked to have Jonas join the church with her, but if he had
                        done it now she herself would have doubted his sincerity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, looky here, Cynthy, ef you&apos;ll say you don&apos;t love me, and never
                        can, I&apos;ll leave you to wunst, and fly away and mourn like a turtle-dove. But so long as
                        it&apos;s nobody but Goshorn, I&apos;m goin&apos; to stay and litigate the question
                        till the Millerite millennium comes. I appeal to Csesar or somebody else. Neither Brother
                        Goshorn nor Brother Hall knows enough to settle this question. I&apos;m agoin&apos; to
                        the persidin&apos; elder. And you can&apos;t try a man and hang him. and tben send him
                        to the penitentiary fer the rest of his born days without givin&apos; him one chance to
                        speak fer hisself agin the world and everybody else. I&apos;m goin&apos; to see the
                        persidin&apos; elder myself and plead my own cause, and ef he goes agin <pb id="VAA2341-193"

                        begin over agin at the bottom with Brother Goshorn, and keep on till I find a man
                        that&apos;s got common-sense enough to salt his religion with.&quot;</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">JULIA&apos;S ENTERPRISE.</head>
                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">UGUST</hi> was very sick at the castle.</p>
                    <p>This was the first news of his return that reached Julia through Jonas and Cynthy Ann.</p>
                    <p>But in my interest in Jonas and Cynthy Ann, of whom I tbink a great deal, I forgot to say that
                        long before the events mentioned in the last chapter, Humphreys had been suddenly called away
                        from his peaceful retreat in the hill country of Clark township. In fact, the
                        &quot;important business,&quot; or &quot;the illness of a friend,&quot;
                        whichever it was, occurred the very next day after Norman Anderson&apos;s father returned
                        from Louisville, and reported that he had secured for his son an &quot;outside
                        situation,&quot; that is to say, a place as a collector.</p>
                    <p>When he had gone, Jonas remarked to Cynthy Ann, &quot;Where the carcass is, there the
                        turkey-buzzards is gethered. That shinin&apos; example of early piety never plays but one
                        game. That is, foxand geese. He&apos;s gone after a green goslin&apos; now, and
                        he&apos;ll find him when he&apos;s fattest,&quot;</p>
                    <p>But the gentle singing-master had come back from his excursion, and was taking a profound
                        interest in the coming end of <pb id="VAA2341-195" n="308"/> the world. Jonas observed that it
                        &quot;seemed like as ef he hed charge of the whole performance, and meant to shet up the sky
                        like a blue cotton umbrell. He&apos;s got a single eye, and it&apos;s the same ole game.
                        Fox and geese always, and he&apos;s the fox.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Humphreys still lived at Samuel Anderson&apos;s, still devoted himself to pleasing Mrs.
                        Abigail, still bowed regretfully to Julia, and spoke caressingly to Betsey Malcolm at every
                        opportunity.</p>
                    <p>But August was sick at the castle. He was very sick. Every morning Dr. Dibrell, a
                        &quot;calomel-doctor&quot;not a steam-doctor rode by the house on his way to
                        Andrew&apos;s, and every morning Mrs. Anderson wondered afresh who was sick down that way.
                        But the doctor staid so long that Mrs. Abigail made up her mind it must be somebody four or five
                        miles away, and so dismissed the matter from her mind. For August&apos;s return had been
                        kept secret.</p>
                    <p>But Julia noticed, in her heart of hearts, and with ever-increasing affliction, that the doctor
                        staid longer each day than on the day before, and she thought she noticed also an increasing
                        anxiety on his face as he rode home again. Her desire to know the real truth, and to see August,
                        to do for him, to give her life for him, were wearing her away. It is hard to see a friend go
                        from you when you have done everything. But to have a friend die within your reach, while you
                        are yet unable to help him, is the saddest of all. All this anxiety Julia suffered with out even
                        the blessed privilege of showing it. The pent-up fire consumed her, and she was at tunes almost
                        distract. Every morning she managed to be on the upper porch when the doctor went by, and from
                        the same watch-tower she studied his face when he went back.</p>
                    <p>Then came a morning when there were two doctors. A physician from the county-seat village went
                        by, in company with Dr. <pb id="VAA2341-196" n="209"/> Dibrell. So there must be a consultation
                        at the castle. Julia knew then that the worst had to be looked in the face. And she longed to
                        get away from under the searching black eyes of her mother and utter the long-pent cry of
                        anguish. Another day of such unuttered pain would drive her clean mad.</p>
                    <p>That evening Jonas came over and sought an interview with Cynthy Ann. He had not been to see her
                        since his unsuccessful courtship. Julia felt that he was the bearer of a message. But Mrs.
                        Anderson was in one of her most exacting humors, and it gave her not a little pleasure to keep
                        Cynthy Ann, on one pretext and another, all the evening at her side. Had Cynthy Ann been less
                        submissive and scrupulous, she might have broken away from this restraint, but in truth she was
                        censuring herself for having any backsliding, rebellious wish to talk with Jonas after she had
                        imagined the idol cast out of her heart entirely. Her conscience was a task-master not less
                        grievous than Mrs. Anderson, and, between the two, Jonas had to go away without leaving his
                        message. And Julia had to keep her breaking heart in suspense a while longer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why did she not elope long ago and get rid of her mother? Because she was Julia, and
                        being Julia, conscientious, true, and filial in spite of her unhappy life, her own character
                        built a wall against such a disobedience. Nearly all limitations are inside. You could do almost
                        anything if you could give yourself up to it, To go in the teeth of one&apos;s family is the
                        one thing that a person of Julia&apos;s character and habits finds nest to impossible. A
                        beneficent limitation of nature; for the cases in which the judgment of a girl of eighteen is
                        better than that of her parents are very few. Besides, the inevitable &quot;heart-disease
                        &quot;was a specter that guarded the gates of Julia&apos;s prison. Night after night she
                        sat looking <pb id="VAA2341-197" n="210"/> out over the hills sleeping in hazy darkness, toward
                        the hollow in which stood the castle; night after night she had half-formed the purpose of
                        visiting August, and then the life-long habit of obedience and a certain sense of delicacy held
                        her back. But on this night, after the consultation, she felt that she would see him if her
                        seeing him brought down the heavens.</p>
                    <p>It was a very dark night. She sat waiting for hoursvery Jong hours they seemed to herand then, at
                        midnight, she began to get ready to start.</p>
                    <p>Only those who have taken such a step can understand the pain of deciding, the agony of
                        misgivings in the execution, the trembling that Julia felt when she turned the brass knob on the
                        front door and lifted the latchlifted the latch slowly and cautiously, for it was near the door
                        of her mother&apos;s roomand then crept out like a guilty thing into the dark dampness of
                        the night, groping her way to the gate, and stumbling along down the road. It had been raining,
                        and there was not one star-twinkle in the sky; the only light was that of glow-worms
                        illuminating here and there two or three blades of grass by feeble shining. Now and then a
                        fire-fly made a spot of light in the blackness, only to leave a deeper spot of blackness when he
                        shut off his intermittent ray. And when at last Julia found herself at the place where the path
                        entered the woods, the blackness ahead seemed still more frightful. She had to grope,
                        recognizing every deviation from the well-beaten path by the rustle of the dead leaves which
                        lay, even in summer, half a foot deep upon the ground. The &quot;fox-fire,&quot; rotting
                        logs glowing with a faint luminosity, startled her several times, and the hooting-owl&apos;s
                        shuddering basshoo! hoo! hoo-oo-ah-h! (like the awful keys of the organ which &quot;touch
                        the spinal cord of the universe&quot;)sent all her blood <pb id="VAA2341-198" n="211"/> to
                        her heart. Under ordinary circumstances, she surely would not have started at the rustling made
                        by the timid hare in the thicket near by. There was no reason why she should shiver so when a
                        misstep caused her to scratch her face with the thorny twigs of a wild plum-tree. But the effort
                        necessary to the under taking and the agony of the long waiting had exhausted her ner-vous
                        force, and she had none left for fortitude. So that when she arrived at Andrew&apos;s fence
                        and felt her way along to the gate, and heard the hoarse, thunderous baying of his great St.
                        Bernard dog, she was ready to faint. But a true instinct makes such a dog gallant It is a vile
                        cur that will harm a lady. Julia walked trembling up to the front-door of the castle, growled at
                        by the huge black beast, and when the Philosopher asmitted her, some time after she had knocked,
                        she sank down fainting into a chair.</p>

                    <p>Mess you!&quot; said Andrew as ho handed her a ground of water to revive her. &quot;You
                        are as faithful as Hero. You are another Heloise. I have been a lonely man; a boughless,
                        leafless trunk, shaken by the whiter winds. But <hi rend="i">you</hi> are my niece. <hi rend="i"
                            >You</hi> know how to be faithful. I am proud of you! Henceforth I call you my daughter. If
                        you <hi rend="i">were</hi> my daughter, you would be to me all that Margaret Roper was to Sir
                        Thomas More.&quot; And the shaggy man of egotistic and pedantic speech, but of womanly sensi
                        bilities, was weeping.</p>
                    <p>The reviving Julia begged to know how August was.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ah, constant heart! And he is constant as you are. Noble fellow! I will not deceive
                        you. The doctors think that he will not live more than twenty-four hours. But he is only dying
                        to see you, now. Your coming may revive him. &quot;We sent for <pb id="VAA2341-200" n="213"
                        /> in some way. But Jonas could not get his message to you. Some angel must have brought you. It
                        is an augury of good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The hopefulness of Andrew sprang out of his faith in an ideal, right outcome. Julia could not
                        conceal from herself the fact that his opinion had no ground. But in such a strait as hers, she
                        could not help clinging even to this support.</p>
                    <p>Andrew was a little perplexed. How to take Julia up-stairs? Mrs. Wehle and Wilhelmina and the
                        doctor went in regularly, not by the rope-ladder, but by a more secure wooden one which he had
                        planted against the outside of the house. But Andrew virtues that he was unwilling to lead her
                        into the upper story in that fashion. His imagination had invested her with all the glories of
                        all the heroines, from Penelope to Beatrice, and from Beatrice to Scott&apos;s Rebecca. At
                        last a sudden impulse seized him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear daughter, they say that genius is to madness close allied. When I built this
                        house I was in a state bordering on insanity, I suppose. I pleased my whims my whims were my
                        only company I pleased my whims in building an American castle. These whims begin to seem
                        childish to me now. I put in a secret stairwat. No human foot but my own has ever trodden it.
                        August, whom I love more than any other, and who is one of the few admitted to my library, has
                        always ascended by the rope-ladder. But you are my niece; I would you were my daughter. I will
                        signalize my reverence for you by showing up the stairway the woman who knows how to love and be
                        faithful, the feet that would be worthy of golden steps if I had them. Come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Spite of her grief and anxiety, Julia was impressed and oppressed <pb id="VAA2341-201" n="214"/>
                        with the reverence shown her by her uncle. She had a veneration almost superstitious for the
                        Philosopher&apos;s learning. She was not accustomed to even respectful treatment, and to be
                        worshiped in this awful way by such a man was something almost as painful as it was pleasant.</p>
                    <p>The entrance to the stairway, if that could be called a stairway which was as difficult of ascent
                        as a ladder, was through a closet by the side of the donjon chimney, and the logs had been so
                        arranged without and within that the space occupied by the narrow and zigzag stairs was not
                        apparent. Up these stairs he took Julia, leaving her in a closet above. As this closet was
                        situated alongside the chimney, it opened, of course, into the small corner room which I have
                        before described, and in which August was now lying. Andrew descended the stairs and entered the
                        upper story again by the outside ladder. He thought best to prepare August for the coming of
                        Julia, lest joy should destroy a life that was so far wasted.</p>

                    <p>H<hi rend="sc">E</hi> left August on that summer day on the levee at Louisville without
                        employment. He was not exactly disheartened, but he was homesick. That he was forbidden to go
                        back by threats of prosecution for his burglarious manner of entering Samuel Anderson&apos;s
                        home was reason enough for wanting to go; that his father&apos;s family were not yet free
                        from danger was a stronger reason; but strongest of all, though he blushed to own it to himself,
                        was the longing to be where he might perchance sometimes see the face he had seen that spring
                        morning in the bottom of a sun-bonnet. Right manfully did he fight against his discouragement
                        and hia homesickness, and his longing to see Julia. It was better to stay where he was. It was
                        better not to go back beaten. If he surrendered so easily, he would never put himself into a
                        situation where he could claim Julia with self-respect. He would stay and make his way in the
                        world somehow. But making his way in the world did not seem half so easy now as it had on that
                        other morning in March when he stood in the barn talking to Julia. Making your fortune always
                        seems so easy until you&apos;ve tried it. It seems rather <pb id="VAA2341-203" n="216"/>
                        easy in a novel, and still easier in a biography. But no Samuel Smiles ever writes the history
                        of those who fail; the vessels that never came back from their venturous voyages left us no
                        log-books. Many have written the History of Success. What melancholy Plutarch shall arise to
                        record, with a pen dipped in wormwood, the History of Failure?</p>
                    <p>No! he would not go back defeated. August said this over bravely, but a little too often, and
                        with a less resolute tone at each repetition. He contemned himself for his weakness, and tried,
                        but tried in vain, to form other plans. Had he known how much one&apos;s physical state has
                        to do with one&apos;s force of character, he might have guessed that he did not deserve the
                        blame he meted out to himself. He might have remembered what Shakespeare&apos;s Portia says
                        to Brutus, that &quot;humour hath his hour with every man.&quot; But with a dull and
                        unaccountable aching in his head and back he compromised with himself. He would go to the castle
                        and pass a day or two. Then he would return and fight it out.</p>
                    <p>So he got on the packet Isaac Shelby, and was soon shaking with a chill that showed how
                        thoroughly malaria had pervaded his system. His very bones seemed frozen. But if you ever shook
                        with such a chill, or rather if you were ever shaken by such a chill, taking hold of you like a
                        demoniacal possession; if you ever felt your brain congealing, your icy bones breaking, your
                        frosty heart becoming paralyzed, with a cold no fire could reach, you know what it is; and if
                        you have not felt it, no words of mine can make you understand the sensations. After the chill
                        came the period when August felt himself between two parts of Milton&apos;s hell, between a
                        sea of ice and a sea of fire; sometimes the hot wave scorched him, then it retired again before
                            <pb id="VAA2341-204" n="217"/> the icy one. At last it was all hot, and the boiling blood
                        scalded his palms and etcamed to his brain, bewildering his thoughts and almost blinding his
                        eyes. He had determined when he started to get off at a wood-yard three miles below
                        Andrew&apos;s castle, to avoid observation and the chance of arrest; and now in his delirium
                        the purpose as he had planned it remained fixed. He got up at two o&apos;clock, crazed with
                        fever, dressed himself, and went out into the rainy night. He went ahore in the mud and bushes,
                        and, guided more by instinct than by any conscious thought, he started up the wagon-track along
                        the river bank. His furious fever drove him on, talking to himself, and splashing recklessly
                        into the pools of rain-water standing in the road. He never remembered his debarkation. He must
                        have fallen once or twice, for he was covered with mud when he rang the alarm at the castle. In
                        answer to Andrew&apos;s &quot;Who&apos;s there?&quot; he answered,
                        &quot;You&apos;ll have to send a harder rain, than that if you want to put this fire
                        out!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And so, what with the original disease, the mental discouragement, and the exposure to the rain,
                        the fever had well-nigh consumed the life, and now that the waves of the hot sea after days of
                        fire and nights of delirium had gone back, there was hardly any life left in the body, and the
                        doctors said there was no hope. One consuming desire remained. He wanted to see Julia once
                        before he went away; and that one desire it seemed impossible to gratify. When he learned of the
                        failure of Jonas to get any message to Julia through Cynthy, he had felt the keenest
                        disappointment, and had evidently been sinking since the hope that kept him up had been taken
                        away.</p>
                    <p>The mother sat by his bed, Gottlieb sat stupefied at the foot, with Jonas by his side, and
                        Wilhelmina was crying in a still <pb id="VAA2341-205" n="218"/> fashion in one corner of the
                        room. August lay breathing feebly, and with his life evidently ebbing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;August!&quot; said Andrew, as he stood over his bed, having come to announce the
                        arrival of Julia. &quot;August!&quot; Andrew tried to speak quietly, but there was a
                        something of hope in the inflection, a tremor of eagerness in the uttetrance, that made the
                        mother look up quickly and inquiringly.</p>
                    <p>August opened his eyes slowly and looked into the face of the Philosopher. Then he slowly closed
                        his eyes again, and a something, not a smilehe was too weak for thalbut a look of infinite
                        content, spread over his wan face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; he whisperd.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Know what?&quot; asked Andrew, leaning down to catch his words&gt;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Julia.&quot; And a single tear crept out from under the closed lid. The tender
                        mother wiped it away.</p>
                    <p>After resting a moment, August looked up at Andrew&apos;s face inquiringly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is coining,&quot; said the Philosopher.</p>
                    <p>August smiled very faintly, but Andrew was sure he smiled, and again leaned down his ear.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She is here,&quot; whispered August; &quot;I heard Charon bark, and a angel out
                        of his cupboard!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not see anybody or anything but the while and wasted face upon the pillow. The eyes
                        were now closed again, and she quickly crossed the floor, andnot without a faint <pb
                            id="VAA2341-206" n="219"/> maidenly blushstooped and kissed the parched lips, from which the
                        life seemed already to have fled.</p>
                    <p>And August with difficulty disengaged his wasted hand from the cover, and laid his nerveless
                        fingersalas! like a skeleton&apos;s nowin the warm hand of Julia, and saidshe leaned down to
                        listen, as he whispered feebly through his dry lips out of a full heart&quot;Thank
                        God!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And the Philosopher, catching the words, said audibly, &quot;Amen&quot;!</p>

                    <p>H<hi rend="sc">OW</hi> Julia spent two hours of blessed sadness at the castle; how August slept
                        peacefully for live minutes at a time with his hand in hers, and then awoke and looked at her,
                        and then slumbered again; how she moistened his parched lips for him, and gave him wine; how at
                        last she had to bid him a painful farewell; how the mother gave her a benediction in German and
                        a kiss; how Wilhelmina clung to her with tears; how Jonas called her a turtle-dove angel; how
                        Brother Hall, the preacher who had been sent for at the mother&apos;s request, to converse
                        with the dying man, spoke a few consoling words to her; how Gottlieb confided to Jonas his
                        intention never to &quot;sprach nodin &apos;pout Yangee kirls no more;&quot; and how
                        at last Uncle Andrew walked home with her, I have not time to tell. When the Philosopher bade
                        her adieu, he called her names which she did not understand. But she turned back to him, and
                        after a minute&apos;s hesitation, spoke huskily. &quot;Uncle Andrew if heif he should
                        get worseI want&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-208" n="221"/>
                    <p>&quot;I know, my daughter; you want him to die your husband?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, if he wishes it. Send for me day or night, and I&apos;ll come in spite of
                        everybody.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;God bless you, my daughter!&quot; said Andrew. And he watched until she got safely
                        into the house without discovery, and then he went back satisfied and proud.</p>
                    <p>Of course August died, and Julia devoted herself to philanthropic labors. It is the fashion now
                        for novels to end thus sadly, and you would not have me be out of the fashion.</p>
                    <p>But August did not die. Joy is a better stimulant than wine. Love is the best tonic in the
                        pharmacopeia. And from the hour in which August Wclile looked into the eyes of Julia, the tide
                        of life set back again. Not perceptibly at first. For two days he was neither better nor worse.
                        But this was a gain. Then slowly he came back to life. But at Andrew&apos;s instance he kept
                        indoors while Humphreys staid.</p>
                    <p>Humphreys, on his part, like Ananias, pretended to have disposed of all his property, paid his
                        debts, reserved enough to live on until the approaching day of doom, and given the rest to the
                        poor of the household of faith, and there were several others who were sincere enough to do what
                        he only pretended. Among the leading Advcntists was &quot;Dr.&quot; Ketchup, who still
                        dealt out corn-sweats and ginseng-tea, but who refused to sell his property. He excused himself
                        by quoting the injunction, &quot;Occupy till I come.&quot; But others sold their estates
                        for trifles, and gave themselves up to proclaiming the millennium.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Abigail Anderson was a woman who did nothing by halves. She was vixenish, she was selfish,
                        she was dishonest and grasping; but she was religious. If any man think this paradox impossible,
                        he has observed character superficially. There are <pb id="VAA2341-209" n="222"/> criminals in
                        State&apos;s-prison who have been very devout all their lives. Religious questions took hold
                        of Mrs. Anderson&apos;s whole nature. She was superstitious, narrow, and intense. She was as
                        sure that the day of judgment would be proclaimed on the eleventh of August, 1843, as she was of
                        her life. No consideration in opposition to any belief of hers weighed a feather with her. Her
                        will mastered her judgment and conscience.</p>
                    <p>And so she determined that Samuel must sell his property desire to square all outstanding debts
                        before the final settlement, how far by a longing to be considered the foremost and most pious
                        of all, and how far by business shrewdness based on that feeling which still lurks in the most
                        protestant people, that such sacrifices do improve their state in a future world, I can not
                        tell. Doubtless fanaticism, hypocrisy, and a self-interest that looked sordidly even at heaven,
                        mingled in bringing about the decision. At any rate, the property was to be sold for a few
                        hundred dollars.</p>
                    <p>Getting wind of this decision, Andrew promptly appeared at his brother&apos;s house and
                        offered to buy it. But Mrs. Abigail couldn&apos;t think of it. Andrew had always been her
                        enemy, and him an inch of the land. It would not be right. He had claimed that part of it
                        belonged to him, and to let him have it would be to admit his claim.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Andrew,&quot; she said, &quot;you do not believe in the millennium, and people
                        say that you are a skeptic. You want to cheat us out of what you think a valuable piece of
                        property. And you&apos;ll find yourself at the last judgment with the weight of this sin on
                        your heart. You will, indeed!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-210" n="223"/>
                    <p>&quot;How clearly you reason about other people&apos;s duty I&quot; said the
                        Philosopher. &quot;If you had seen your own duty half so clearly, some of us would have been
                        better off, and your account would have been straighter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Here Mrs. Anderson grew very angry, and vented her spleen him that the archangel might blow his
                        trumpet at any moment. Then where would he be? she asked in exultation. Human meanness is never
                        so pitiful as when it tries to seize on God&apos;s judgments as weapons with which to
                        gratify its own spites. trust this remark will not be considered as applying only to Mrs.
                        Anderson.</p>
                    <p>But Mrs. Anderson fired off all the heavenly small-shot she could find in the teeth and eyes of
                        Andrew, and then, to prevent a rejoinder, she told him it was time for her to go to secret
                        prayer, and she only stopped upon the threshold to send back be ready.</p>
                    <p>I wonder if a certain class of religious people have ever thought how much their exclusiveness
                        and Pharisaism have to do with the unhappy fruitlessness of all their appeals! Had Mrs. Anderson
                        been as blameless as an angel, such exhortations would have driven a weaker than Andrew to hate
                        the name of religion.</p>
                    <p>But I must not moralize, for Mr. Humphreys has already divulged his plan of disposing of the
                        property. He has a friend, one Thomas A. Parkins, who has money, and who will buy the farm at
                        two hundred dollars. He could procure the money in advance any day by going to the village of
                        Bethany, the county-seat, and drawing on Mr. Parkins, and cashing the <pb id="VAA2341-211"
                            n="224"/> draft. It wag a matter of indifference to him, he said, only that he would like to
                        oblige so good a friend.</p>
                    <p>This arrangement, by which the Anderson farm was to be sold for a song to some distant stranger,
                        pleased Mrs. Abigail. She could not bear that one of her unbelieving neighbors should even for a
                        fortnight rejoice in a supposed good bargain at her expense. To sell to Mr. Humphreys&apos;s
                        friend in Louisville was just the thing. When pressed by some of her neighbors who had not
                        received the Adventist gospel, to tell on what principle she could justify her sale of the farm
                        at all, she answered that if the farm would not be of any account after the end of the would,
                        neither would the money.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Humphreys went down to the town of Bethany and came back, affecting to have cashed a draft on
                        his friend for two hundred dollars. The deeds were drawn, and a justice of the peace was to come
                        the next morning and take the acknowledgment of Mr. and Mrs. Anderson.</p>
                    <p>This was what Jonas learned as he sat in the kitchen talking to Cynthy Ann. He had come to bring
                        some message from the convalescent August, and had been detained by the attraction of adhesion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you it was fox-and-geese. Didn&apos;t I? And so Thomas A. Parkins <hi

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">UST</hi>at this point arrived Mr. Hall, whom I have before described as the good
                        but callow Methodist preacher on tbe circuit. Some people think that aminister of the gospel
                        should be exempt from criticism, ridicule, and military duty. But the manly minister takes his
                        lot with the rest. Nothing could be more pernicious than making the foibles of a minister
                        sacred. Doubtless Mr. Hall has long since come to laugh at his own early follies, his official
                        sanctimoniousness, and all that; and why should not I, who have been a callow circuit-preacher
                        myself in my day, laugh at my Brother Hall, for the good of his kind?</p>
                    <p>He had come to visit Sister Cynthy Ann, whose name had long stood on the class-book at
                        Harden&apos;s Cross-Roads as a good and acceptable member of the church in full connection.
                        He was visiting formally and officially each family in which there was a member. Had he visited
                        informally and unofficially, and like a man instead of like a minister, he would have done more
                        good. But he came to Samuel Anderson&apos;s, and informed Mrs. Anderson that he was visiting
                        his members, and that as one of her house-hold <pb id="VAA2341-213" n="226"/> was a member, he
                        would like to have a little religious conversation and prayer with the family. Would she please
                        gather them together?</p>
                    <p>So julia was called down-stairs, and Jonas was invited in from the kitchen. The sight of him
                        distressed Brother Hall. For was not this New Light sent here by Satan to lead astray one of his
                        flock? But, at least, he would labor faithfully with him.</p>
                    <p>He began with Mr. Samuel Anderson. But that worthy, after looking at his wife in vain for a cue,
                        darted off about the trumpets of the Apocalypse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Anderson, as head of this family, your responsibility is very great. Do you feel
                        the full assurance, my brother?&quot; asked Mr. Hall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Anderson, &quot;I am standing with my lamp trimmed and
                        ready. I am listening for the midnight shout. Tonight the trumpet may sound. Iam afraid you
                        don&apos;t do your duty, or you would lift up your voice. The time and times and a half are
                        almost ont.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hall was a little dashed at this. A man whose religious conversation is of a set and
                        conventional type, is always shocked and jostled when he is thrown from the track. And he
                        himself, like everybody else, had felt the Adventist infection, and did not want to commit
                        himself. So he turned to Mrs. Andeson. She answered like a seraph every question put to herthe
                        startle the conscience of a self-deceiver. Mr. Hall congratulated her in his most official tone
                        (a compound of authority, awfulness, and sanctity) on her deep experience of the things that
                        made for her everlasting peace. He told her that people of her <pb id="VAA2341-214" n="227"/>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-215" n="229"/> high attainments must beware of spiritual pride. And Mrs.
                        Anderson took the warning with beautiful meekness, sinking into forty fathoms of undisguised and
                        rather ostentatious humility, that did not penetrate the cuticle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you, Sister Cynthy Ann,&quot; he said, fighting shy of Jonas for the present,
                        &quot;I trust you are trying to let your light shine. Do you feel that you are pressing
                        on?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Poor Cynthy Ann sank into a despondency deeper than usual. She was afeard not. Seemed like as ef
                        her heart was cold and dead to God. Seemed like as ef she couldn&apos;t no ways gin up the
                        world. It weighed her down like a rock, and many was the fight she had with the enemy. No, she
                        wuzn&apos;t getting on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear sister,&quot; said Mr. Hall, &quot;let me warn you. Here is Mrs.
                        Anderson, who has given up the world entirely. I hope you&apos;ll follow so good an example.
                        Do not be led astray by worldly affections; they are sure to entrap you. I am afraid you have
                        not maintained your steadfastness as you should.&quot; Here Mr. Hall&apos;s eye waudered
                        doubtfully to Jonas, of whom he felt a little afraid. Jonas, on his part, had no reason to like
                        Mr. Hall for his advice in Cynthy&apos;s love affair, and now the minister&apos;s
                        praises of Mrs. Anderson and condemnation of Cynthy Ann had not put him in any mood to listen to
                        exhortation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Mr. Harrison,&quot; said the young minister solemnly, approaching Jonas much
                        as a dog does a hedgehog, &quot;how do you feel to-day?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Middlin&apos; peart, I thank you; how&apos;s yourself?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This upset the good man not a little, and convinced him that Jonas was in a state of extreme
                        wickedness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you a Christian?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-216" n="230"/>
                    <p>&quot;Wal, I &apos;low I am. How about yourself, Mr. Hall?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe you are a New Light. Now, do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?&quot;
                        asked the minister in an annihilating tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes I do, my aged friend, a heap sight more&apos;n I do in some of them that
                        purtends to hev a paytent right on all his blessins, and that put on solemn airs and call other
                        denominations hard names. My friend, I don&apos;t believe is no religion that&apos;s
                        made up of sighs and groans and high temper&quot; (with a glance at Mrs. Anderson),
                        &quot;and that thinks a good deal more of its bein&apos; sound in doctrine than of the
                        danger of bein&apos; rotten in life. They&apos;s lots o&apos; bad eggs got slick and
                        shiny shells!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hall happened to think just here of the injunction against throwing pearls before swine, and
                        so turned to Humphreys, who made his heart glad by witnessing a good confession, in soft and
                        unctuous tones, and couched in the regulation phrases which have worn smooth in long use.</p>
                    <p>Julia had slunk away in a corner. But now he appealed to her also.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Blest with a praying mother, you, Miss Anderson, ought to repent of your sins and flee
                        from the wrath to come. You know the right way. You have been pointed to it by the life of your
                        parents from childhood. Reared in the bosom of a Christian household, let me entreat you to seek
                        salvation immediately.&quot;</p>
                    <p>I do not like to repeat this talk here. But it is aa unfortunate fact that goodness and
                        self-sacrificing piety do not always go with practical wisdom. The novelist, like the historian,
                        must set down things as he finds them. A man who talks in consecrated phrases is yet in the
                        poll-parrot state of mental development.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you feel a desire to flee from the wrath to come?&quot; he asked <pb
                            id="VAA2341-217" n="231"/> &quot;My dear young sister, you have great reason to be
                        thankful very great reason for gratitude to Almighty God.&quot; (Like many other pious young
                        men, Mr. Hall said <hi rend="i">Gawd.</hi>) &quot;I met you the despaired of has
                        recovered.&quot; And with more of this, Mr. Hall her rapt condition of mind, seemed to be
                        petrifying.</p>
                    <p>I trust the reader does not expect me to describe the feelings of Julia while Mr. Hall read a
                        chapter and prayed. Nor the emotions of Mrs. Anderson. I think if Mr. Hall could have heard her
                        grind her teeth while he in his prayer gave thanks for the recovery of August, he would not have
                        thought so highly the minister was fairly out of the house. In bidding good-by, characteristic
                        lack of sagacity, he took her emotion to be a sign of religious feeling, and told her he was
                        pleased to see that she And then he left, And then came the deluge.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> indescribable deluge! But, after all, the worst of anything of that sort
                        is the moment before it begins. A plunge-bath, a tooth-pulling, an amputation, and a dress-party
                        are all worse in anticipation than in the moment of infliction. Julia, as the stood busily
                        sticking a pin in the window-sash, waiting for her mother to begin, wished that the storm might
                        burst, and be done with it. But Mrs. Anderson understood her business too well for that. she
                        knew the value of the awful moments of silence beforer beginning. She had not practiced all her
                        life without learning the fine art ot torture in its exquisite details. I doubt not the
                        blackrobed fathers of the Holy Office were leisurely gentlemen, giving their victims plenty of
                        time for anticipatory meditation, laying out their utensils quietly, inspecting the thumb-screw
                        affectionately to make sure that it would work smoothly, discussing the rack and wheel with much
                        tender forethought, as though torture were a sweet thing, to be reserved like a little
                        girl&apos;s candy lamb, and only resorted to when the appetite has <pb id="VAA2341-219"
                            n="233"/> been duly whetted by contemplation. I never had the pleasure of knowing an
                        inquisitor, and I can not certify that they were of this deliberate fashion. But it
                        &quot;stands to nature &quot;that they were. For the vixens who are vixens of the
                        highest quality, are always deliberate.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson felt that the piece of invective which she was about to undertake, was the piece of
                        invective which she visedly, &quot;but reverently, discreetly, and in the fear of
                        God.&quot; And so she paused, and Julia fumbled the tassel of the window-curtain, and
                        trembled with tbe chill of expectation. And Mrs. Abigail continued to debate how she might make
                        this, which would doubtless be her last outburst before the day of judgement, her
                        masterpieceworthy song of the dying swan. And then she hoped, she sincerely hoped, to be able by
                        this awful <hi rend="i">coup de main</hi> to awaken Julia to a sense of her sinfulness. For
                        there was such a jumble of mixed motives in her mind, that one could never distinguish her
                        sincerity from her hypocrisy.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson&apos;s conscience was quite an objective one. As Jonas often remarked,
                        &quot;she had a feelin&apos; sense of other folkses unworthiness.&quot; And the sins
                        which she appreciated were generally sins against herself. Julia&apos;s disobedience to
                        herself waa darker in her mind than murder committed on anybody else would have been. And now
                        she sat deliberating, not on the limit of the verbal punishment she meant to inflictthat gave
                        her no concernbut on her ability to do the matter justice. Even as a tyrannical backwoods
                        school-master straightens his long beech-rod relishfully before applying it.</p>
                    <p>Not that Mrs. Anderson was silent all this time. She was sighing and groaning in a spasmodic
                        devotion. She was &quot;seeking strength from above to do her whole duty,&quot; she
                        would have <pb id="VAA2341-220" n="234"/> told you. She was &quot;agonizing&quot; in
                        prayer for her daughter, and she contrived that her stage-whisper praying should now and then
                        reach the ears of its devoted object. Humphreys remained seated, pretending to read the copy of
                        &quot;Josephus,&quot; but watching he remained Jonas determined to stay, to keep Julia
                        in countenance, and he beckoned to Cynthy to stay also. And Samuel Anderson, who loved his
                        daughter and feared his wife, fled like a coward from the coming scene. Everybody expected Mrs.
                        Anderson to break out like a fury.</p>
                    <p>But she knew a better plan than that. She felt a new device come like an inspiration. And perhaps
                        it was. It really seemed to Jonas that the devil helped her. For instead of breaking out into
                        commonplace scolding, the resources of which she had long since exhausted, she dropped upon her
                        knees, and began to pray for Julia.</p>
                    <p>No swearer ever curses like the priest who veils Ms personal spites in official and pious
                        denunciations, and Mrs. Anderson had never dealt out abuse so roundly and terribly and
                        crushyingly, as she did under the guise of praying for the salvation of Julia&apos;s soul
                        from well-deserved perdition. But Abigail did not say perdition. She left that to weak spirits.
                        She thought it a virtue to say &quot;hell&quot; with unction and emphasis, by way of
                        alarming the consciences of sinners. Mrs. Anderson&apos;s prayer is not reportable. That
                        sort of profanity is too bad to write. She capped her climaxeven as I have heard a revivalist
                        pray for a scoffer that had vexed his righteous soulby asking God to convert her daughter, or if
                        she could not be converted to take her away, that she might not heap up wrath against the day of
                        wrath. For that sort of religious excitement which does not quiet the <pb id="VAA2341-221"
                            n="235"/> evil passions, seems to inflame them, and Mrs. Anderson was not in any right sense
                        sane. And the prayer was addressed more to the frightened Julia than to God. She would have been
                        terribly afflicted had her petition been granted.</p>
                    <p>Julia would have run away from the admonition which followed the prayer, had it not been tbat
                        Mrs. Anderson adroitly Julia to repent, and then, affecting to show her her sinfulness, she
                        proceeded to abuse her.</p>
                    <p>Had Julia no temper? Yes, she had doubtless a spice of her mother&apos;s anger without her
                        meanness. She would have resisted, but that from childhood she had felt paralyzed by the utter
                        uselessness of all resistance. The bravest of the villagers at the foot of Vesuvius never
                        dreamed of stopping the crater&apos;s month.</p>
                    <p>But, happily, at last Mrs. Anderson&apos;s insane wrath went a little too far.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You poor lost sinner,&quot; she said, &quot;to think you should go to
                        destruction under my very eyes, disgracing us all, by running over the country at night with bad
                        men! But there&apos;s mercy even for such as you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia would not have understood the full meaning of this aspersion of her purity, had she not
                        caught Humphreys&apos;s eye. His expression, half sneer, half leer, seemed to give her
                        mother&apos;s saying its full interpretation. She put out her hand. She turned white, and
                        said: &quot;Say one word more, and I will go away from you and never come back!
                        Never!&quot; And then she sat down and cried, and then Mrs. Anderson&apos;s maternal
                        love, her &quot;unloving love,&quot; revived. To have her daughter leave her, too, would
                        be a sort of defeat. Sbe hushed, and sat down in her splint-bottomed rocking-chair, which
                        snapped when she rocked, and which seemed <pb id="VAA2341-222" n="236"/> to speak for her after
                        she had shut her mouth. Her face settled into a martyr-like appeal to Heaven in proof of the
                        justice of her cause. And then she fell back on her forlorn hope. She wept hysterically, in
                        sincere self-pity, to think that an affectionate mother should have such a daughter!</p>
                    <p>Julia, finding that her mother had desisted, went to her room. She did not exactly pray, but she
                        talked to herself as she paced the floor. It was a monologue, and yet there was a conscious
                        appeal to an invisible Presence, who could not misjudge her, and so she passed from talking to
                        herself to talking to God, and that without any of the formality of prayer. Her mother had made
                        God seem to be against her. Now she, like David, protested her innocence to God. She recited
                        half to herself, and yet also to Godfor is not every appeal to one&apos;s conscience in some
                        sense an appeal to God?she recited all the struggles of that night when she went to August at
                        the castle. People talk of the consolation there is in God&apos;s mercy. But Julia found
                        comfort in God&apos;s justice. He <hi rend="i">could</hi> not judge her wrongly.</p>
                    <p>Then she opened the Testament at the old place, and read the words long since fixed in her
                        memory. And then she weary and heavy ladencame again to Him who invites, and found rest. And
                        then she found, as many another has found, that coming to God is not, as theorists will have it,
                        a coming once for a lifetime, but a coming oft and ever repeated.</p>
                    <p>Jonas and Cynthy Ann retired to the kitchen, and the former said in his irreverent way,
                        &quot;Blamed ef Abigail ha&apos;nt got more devils into her&apos;n Mary Magdalene
                        had the purtiest day she ever seed! I should think, arter a life with her fcr a mother, the bad
                        place would be a healthy and delightful clime. The devil a&apos;n&apos;t a
                        patchin&apos; to her.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-223" n="237"/>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t, Jonas; you talk so cur&apos;us, like as cf you was kinder sorter
                        wicked.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s jest what I am, my dear, but Abigail Anderson&apos;s wicked without
                        the kinder sorter. She cusses when she&apos;s aprayin&apos;. She cusses that poar gal
                        right in the Lord&apos;s face. Good by, I must go. Smells so all-fired like brimstone about
                        here.&quot; This last was spoken in an undertone of indignant soliloquy, as he crossed the
                        threshold of Cynthy&apos;s clean kitchen.</p>

                    <head type="subtitle">SCARING A HAWK.</head>
                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">ONAS</hi> was thoroughly alarmed. He exaggerated the harm that Humphreys might do
                        to August, now that he knew where he was. Auguest, on his part, felt sure that Humphreys would
                        not do anything against him; certainly not in the way of legal proceedings. And as for the sale
                        of Samuel Anderson&apos;s farms, that did not disturb him. Like almost everybody else at
                        that time, August Wehle was strongly impressed by the assertions of the Millerites, and if the
                        world should be finished in the next month, the farms wore of no consequence. And if Millerism
                        proved a delusion, the loss of Samuel Anderson&apos;s property would only leave Julia on his
                        level, so far as worldly goods went. The happiness this last rejoice in Mr. Anderson&apos;s
                        misfortune? Why should he wish <pb id="VAA2341-225" n="239"/> to pull Julia down to him? But
                        still the thought remained a pleasant one.</p>
                    <p>Jonas would not have it so. He had his plan. He went home from the Adventist meeting that very
                        night with Cynthy Ann, and then stood talking to her at the corner of the porch, feeling very
                        sure that Humphreys would listen, from above. He heard his stealthy tread, after a while,
                        disturb a loose board on the upper porch. Then he began to talk to Cynthy Ann in this strain:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see, I can&apos;t tell no secrets, Cynthy Ann, even to your Royal Goodness, as
                        I might say, seein&apos; as how as you a&apos;n&apos;t my wife, and
                        a&apos;n&apos;t likely to be, if Brother Goshorn. can have his way. But you&apos;re
                        the Queen of Hearts, anyhow. But s&apos;pose I was to hint a secret?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Shshh-h-h!&quot; said Cynthy Ann, partly because she felt a sinful pleasure in the
                        flattery, and partly because she felt sure that Humphreys was above. But Jonas paid no attention
                        to the caution.</p>
                    <p> &quot;I&apos;ll gin you a hint as string as a Irishman&apos;s, which they do
                        say&apos;ll knock you down. Let&apos;s s&apos;pose a case. They
                        a&apos;n&apos;t no harm in s&apos;posin&apos; a case, you know. I&apos;ve
                        knowed boys who&apos;d throw a rock at a fence-rail and hit a stump, and then say,
                        &apos; S&apos;posin&apos; they was a woodpecker on that air stump, wouldn&apos;t
                        I a keeled him over?&apos; You can s&apos;pose a case and make a woodpecker wherever you
                        want to. Well, s&apos;posin&apos; guv&apos;nor of the State of ole Kaintuck to the
                        guv&apos;nor of the State of Injeanny? And s&apos;posin&apos; that the dokyment got
                        lodged in this &apos;ere identical county? And s&apos;posin&apos; it called fer the
                        body of one Thomas A. Parkins, <hi rend="i">alias</hi> J. W. &apos;Umphreya? <pb
                            id="VAA2341-226" n="240"/> And s&apos;posin&apos; it speecified as to sartain and
                        sundry crimes committed in Paduky and all along the shore, fer all I know? Now,
                        s&apos;posin&apos; all of them air things, what <hi rend="i">would</hi> Clark township
                        do to console itself when that toonful v&apos;ice and them air blazin! watch-seals had set
                        in ignominy for ever and ever? Selah! Good-night, and don&apos;t you breathe a word to a
                        livin&apos; soul, nur a dead one, &apos;bout what I been a-sayin&apos;.
                        You&apos;ll know more by daylight to-morry &apos;n you know now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And the last part of the speech was true, for by midnight the Hawk had fled And the sale of the
                        Anderson farm to Humphreys was never completed. For three days the end of the world was
                        forgotten in the interest which Clark township felt in the flight of its favorite. And by
                        degrees the story of Norman&apos;s encounter with the gamblers and of August&apos;s
                        recovery of the money became spread abroad through the confidential hints of Jonas. And by
                        degrees another story became known; it could not long be concealed. It was the story of Betsey
                        Malcolm, who averred that she had been privately married to Humphreys on the occasion of a
                        certain trip they had made to Kentucky together, to attend a &quot;big meeting.&quot;
                        The story was probably true, but uncharitable gossips shook their heads.</p>
                    <p>It was only a few evenings after the flight of Humphreys that Jonas had another talk with Cynthy
                        Ann, in which he confessed that all his supposed case about a requisition from the governor of
                        Kentucky for Humphreys&apos;s arrest was pure fiction.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, Jonas, isis that air right? I&apos;m afeard it a&apos;n&apos;t right
                        to tell an ontruth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So &apos;ta&apos;n&apos;t; but I only s&apos;posed a case, you
                        know.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-227" n="241"/>
                    <p>&quot;But Brother Hall said last Sunday two weeks, that anything that gin a false impression
                        waswas lying. Now, I don&apos;t think yon meant it, but then I thought I orto speak to you
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, maybe you&apos;re right. I see you last summer a-puttin&apos; up a
                        skeercrow to keep the poor, hungry little birds of the air from gittin&apos; the peas that
                        they needed to sustain life. An&apos; I said, What a pity that the best woman I ever seed
                        should tell lies to the poor little birds that can&apos;t defend theirselves from her wicked
                        wiles! But I see that same day a skeercrow, a mean, holler, high-percritical purtense of a ole
                        bat aud coat, a-hanging in Brother Goshorn&apos;s garden down, to the cross-roads.
                        An&apos; I wondered ef it was your Methodis&apos; trainin&apos; that taught you
                        sech-like cheatin&apos; of the little sparrys and blackbirds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&apos;&apos;Yes; but Jonas&quot; said Cynthy, bewildered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I see a few days arterwards a Englishman with a humbug-fly onto his line, a
                        foolin&apos; the poor, simple-hearted little fishes into swallerin&apos; a hook that
                        hadn&apos;t nary sign of a ginowine bait onto it. An&apos; I says, says I, What a
                        deceitful thing the human heart is!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Jonas, you&apos;d make a preacher!&quot; said Cynthy Ann, touched with the
                        fervor of his utterance, and inly resolved never to set up another scarecrow.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not much, my dear. But then, you see, I make distinctions. Ef I was to see a wolf
                        a-goin&apos; to eat a lamb, what would I do? Why, I&apos;d skeer or fool him with the
                        very fust thing I could find. Wouldn&apos; you, honey?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In course,&quot; said Cynthy Ann.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so, when I seed a wolf or a tiger or a painter, like <pb id="VAA2341-228" n="242"/>
                        that air &apos;Umphreys, about to gobble up fortins, and to do some barm to Gus, maybe, I
                        jest rigged up a skeercrow of words, like a ole hat and coat stuck onto a stick, and run him
                        off. Any harm done, my dear?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, no, Jonas; I rather &apos;low not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Whether Jonas&apos;s defense was good or not, I can not say, for I do not know. But he is
                        entitled to the benefit of it.</p>

                    <p>J<hi rend="sc">ONAS</hi> had waited for the coming of the quarterly meeting to carry his appeal
                        to the presiding elder. The quarterly meeting for the circuit was held at the village of
                        Brayville, and beds were made upon the floor for the guests who crowded the town. Every visiting
                        Methodist had a right to entertainment, and every resident Methodist opened his doors very wide,
                        for Western people are hospitable in a fashion and with a bountifulness unknown on the eastern
                        side of the mountains. Who that has not known it, can ever understand the delightfulness of a
                        quarterly meeting? The meeting of old friendsthe social lifeis all but heavenly. And then the
                        singing of the old Methodist hymns, such as</p>
                    <lg>

                    <p>And that other solemnly-sweet refrain:</p>

                        <l n="5">&quot;The reaping-time will surely come,</l>

                    <p>And who shall describe the joy of a Christian mother, when her scapegrace son &quot;laid down
                        the arms of his rebellion&quot; and was &quot;soundly converted &quot;? Let those
                        sneer who will, but such moral miracles as are wrought in. Methodist revivals are more wonderful
                        than any healing of the blind or raising of the dead could be.</p>
                    <p>Jonas turned up, faithful to his promise, and called on the &quot;elder&quot; at the
                        place where he was staying, and asked for a private interview. He found the old gentleman
                        exercising his sweet voice in singing, <q direct="unspecified">

                        </q> When he concluded the verse he raised his half-closed eyes and saw Jonas standing in the
                        door.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Persidin&apos; Elder,&quot; said Jonas, trying in vain to speak with some
                        seriousness and veneration, &quot;I come to as your consent to marry one of your flockthe
                        best lamb you&apos;ve got in the whole fold.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bless you, Mr. Harrison,&quot; said Father Williams, the old elder, laughing,
                        &quot;bless you, I haven&apos;t any right to consent or forbid. Ask the lady
                        herself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ax the lady!&quot; said Jonas. &quot;Didn&apos;t I though! And
                        didn&apos;t Mr. Goshorn forbid the lady to marry me, under the pains and penalties pervided;
                        and didn&apos;t Mr. Hall set his seal to the forbiddin&apos; of Goshorn! An&apos; I
                        says to her, &apos; I won&apos;t take nothin&apos; less <pb id="VAA2341-231" n="245"

                        to you on a writ of <hi rend="i">habous corpus</hi>, or whatever you may call it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The presiding elder laughed again, and looked closely at Jonas. Then he stepped to the door and
                        called in the circuit preacher, Mr. Hall, and the class leader, Mr. GoShorn, both of whom
                        happened to he in the next room engaged in an excited discussion with a brother who was a little
                        touched with Millerism.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s this Mr. Harrison tells me about your forbidding the banns in his

                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a New Light,&quot; said Brother Hall, showing his abhorrence in his
                        face, &quot;and it seemed to me that for a Methodist to marry a New Light was a sina being
                        yoked together unequally with an unbeliever. You know, Father Williams, that New Lights are
                        Arians.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man seemed more amused than ever. Turning to Jonas, he asked him if he was an Arian.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as I knows on, my venerable friend. I may have caught the disease when I had the
                        measles, or I may have been a Arian in infancy, or I may be a Arian on my mother&apos;s
                        side, you know; but as I don&apos;t know who or what, it may be, I a&apos;n&apos;t
                        in no way accountable fer itno more&apos;n Brother Goshorn is to blame fer his face
                        bein&apos; so humbly. But I take it Arian is one of them, air pleasant names you and the New
                        Light preachers uses in your Christian intercourse together to make one another mad.
                        I&apos;m one of them as goes to heaven straightnever stoppin&apos; to throw no donicks
                        at the Methodists, Presbyterians, nor no other misguided children of men. They may ride in the
                        packet, or go <pb id="VAA2341-232" n="246"/> by flat-boat or keel-boat, ef they chooses. I go by
                        the swift sailin&apos; and palatial mail-boat New Light, and I don&apos;t run no
                        opposition line, nor bust my bilers tryin&apos; to beat my neighbors into the heavenly
                        port.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Brother Goshorn looked vexed. Brother Hall was scandalized at the lightness of Jonas&apos;s
                        conversation. But the old presiding elder, with keen common-sense and an equally keen <figure

                        laughing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you an unbeliever?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what you call onbeliever. I believe in God and Christ, and keep
                        Sunday and the Fourth of July; but I don&apos;t believe in all of Brother Goshorn&apos;s
                        nonsense about wearing veils and artificials.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Brother Hall, &quot;would you endeavor to induce your wife to
                        dress in a manner unbecoming a Methodist?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-233" n="248"/>

                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t fer the world. If I git the article I want, I don&apos;t keer
                        what it&apos;s tied up in, calico or bombazine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t you join the Methodist Church yourself, and keep your wife company?
                        &quot;It was Brother Goshorn who spoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t I? I suppose I could ef I didn&apos;t think no more of religion
                        than some other folks. I could jine the Methodist Church, and have everybody say I jined to git
                        my wife. That may be serving God; but I can&apos;t see how. And then how long would you keep
                        me? The very fust time I fired off my blunderbuss in class-meetin&apos;, and you heerd the
                        buckshot and the squirrel-shot and the slugs and all sorts of things a-rattlin&apos; around,
                        you&apos;d say I was makin&apos; fun of the Gospel. I &apos;low they
                        a&apos;n&apos;t no Methodist in me. I was cut out cur&apos;us, you know, and made up
                        crooked&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there anything against Mr. Harrison, Brother Goshorn? &quot;asked the elder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a New Light,&quot; said Mr. Goshorn, in a tone that signified his
                        belief that to be a New Light was enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is he honest and steady?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Never heard anything against him as a moralist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, then, it&apos;s my opinion that any member of your class would do better to
                        marry a good, faithful, honest New Light than to marry a hickory Methodist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jonas got up like one demented, and ran out of the door and across the street. In a moment he
                        came back, bringing Cynthy Ann in triumph.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, say them words over again,&quot; he said to the presiding elder.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sister Cynthy Ann,&quot; said the presiding elder, &quot;you really love
                        Brother Harrison?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-235" n="250"/>
                    <p>&quot;II don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s right to set our sinful hearts on the
                        things of this perishin&apos; world. But I think more of him, I&apos;m afeard, than I
                        had ort to. He&apos;s got as good a heart as I ever seed. But Brother Goshorn thought I
                        hadn&apos;t orter marry him, seein&apos; he is a onbeliever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I a&apos;n&apos;t,&quot; said Jonas; &quot;I believe in the Bible,
                        and in every thing in it, and in Cynthy Ann and her good Methodist religion besides.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think you can give up all your scruples and marry Mr, Harrison, and love him and be
                        happy,&quot; said the presiding elder. &quot;Don&apos;t be afraid to be happy, my
                        sister. You&apos;ll be happy in good company in heaven, and you&apos;d just as well get
                        used to it here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you I&apos;d find a man that had salt enough to keep his religion sweet.
                        And, Father Williams, you&apos;ve got to marry us, whenever Cynthy Ann&apos;s
                        ready,&quot; said Jonas with enthusiasm.</p>
                    <p>And for a moment the look of overstrained scrupulosity on Cynthy Ann&apos;s face relaxed and
                        a strange look of happiness came into her eyes.</p>
                    <p>And the time was fixed then and there.</p>
                    <p>Brother Hall was astonished.</p>
                    <p>And Brother Goshorn drew down his face, and said that he didn&apos;t know what was to become
                        of good, old-fashioned Methodism and the rules of the <hi rend="i">Discipline</hi>, if the
                        presiding elders talked in that sort of a way. The church was going to the dogs.</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> flight of the Hawk did not long dampen the ardor of those who were looking
                        for signs in the heaven above and the earth beneath. I have known a school-master to stand,
                        switch in hand, and give a stubborn boy a definite number of minutes to yield. The boy who would
                        not have submitted on account of any amount of punishment, was subdued by the awful waiting.
                        &quot;We have all read the old school-book story of the prison-warden who brought a mob of
                        criminals to subjection by the same process. Millerism produced some such effect as this. The
                        assured belief of the believers had a great effect on others; the dreadful drawing on of the set
                        time day by day produced an effect in some regions absolutely awful. An eminent divine, at that
                        time a pastor in Boston, has told me that the leaven of Adventism permeated all religious
                        bodies, and, that he himself could not avoid the fearful sense of waiting for some
                        catastrophethe impression that all this expectation of people must have some significance. If
                        this was the effect in Boston, imagine the effect in a country neighborhood like Clark township.
                        Andrew, skeptical <pb id="VAA2341-237" n="252"/> as he waa visionary, was almost the only man.
                        that escaped: the infeetion. Jonas would have &quot;been as frankly irreverent if the day of
                        doom had come as he was at all times; but even Jonas had come to the conclusion that
                        &quot;somethin&apos; would happen, or else somethin&apos; else.&quot; August,
                        with a young man&apos;s impressibility, was awe-stricken with thoughts of the nearing end of
                        the world, and Julia accepted it as settled.</p>
                    <p>It is a good thing that the invisible world is so thoroughly shut out from this. The effect of
                        too vivid a conception of it is never wholesome. It was pernicious in the middle age, and
                        clairvoyance and spirit-rapping would be great evils to the world, if it were not that the
                        spirits, even of the ablest men, in losing their bodies seem to lose their wits. It is well that
                        it is so, for if Washington Irving dictated to a medium accounts of the other world in a style
                        such as that of his &quot;Little Britain,&quot; for instance, we should lose all
                        interest in the affairs of this sphere, and nobody would buy our novels.</p>
                    <p>This fever of excitement kept alive Samuel Anderson&apos;s determination to sell Ms farms for
                        a trifle a9 a testimony to unbelievers. He found that fifty dollars would meet his expenses
                        until the eleventh of August, and so the price was set at that.</p>
                    <p>As soon as Andrew heard of this, he privately arranged with Jonas to buy it; but Mrs. Anderson
                        utterly refused. She said she could see through it all. Jonas was one of Andrew&apos;s
                        fingers. Andrew had got to be a sort of a king in Clark township, and Jonas waswas the
                        king&apos;s fool. She did not mean that any of her property should go into the hands of the
                        clique that were try ing to rob her of her property and her daughter. Even for two weeks they
                        should not own her house!</p>
                    <p>Before this speech was ended, Bob Walker entered the door. <pb id="VAA2341-238" n="253"/> Bob was
                        tall, stooped, good-natured, and desperately poor. With ten children under twelve years of age,
                        with an incorrigible fondness for loafing and telling funny stories, Bob saw no chance to
                        improve his condition, A man may be either honest or lazy and <figure entity="VAA2341-32">
                            <p rend="center">&quot;WANT TO BUY YOUR PLACE.&quot;</p>
                        </figure> get rich; but a man who is both honest and indolent is doomed. Bob lived in a cabin on
                        the Anderson farm, and when not hired by Samuel Anderson he did clays&apos; work here and
                        there, riding to and from his labor on a raw-boned mare, that was the laughing-stock of the
                        county. Bob pathetically called her Splinter-shin, <pb id="VAA2341-239" n="254"/> and he always
                        rode bareback, for the very good reason that he had neither saddle nor sheepskin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Anderson,&quot; said Bob, standing in the door and trying to Straighten the
                        chronic stoop out of his shoulders, &quot;I want to buy your place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If Bob had said that he wanted to be elected president, Samuel Anderson could not have been more
                        surprised.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You look astonished; but folks don&apos;t know everything. I low I know how to lay
                        by a little. But I never could git enough to buy a decent kind of a tater-patch. So I says to my
                        ole woman this mornin&apos;, &apos;Jane,&apos; says I,&apos; let&apos;s git
                        some ground. Let&apos;s buy out Mr. Anderson, and see how it&apos;ll feel to be rich fer
                        a few days. If she all burns up, let her burn, I say. We&apos;ve had a plaguey hard time of
                        it, let&apos;s see how it goes to own two farms fer awhile.&apos; And so we thought
                        we&apos;d rather hev the farms fer two weeks than a little money in a ole stocking. What
                        d&apos;ye say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jonas here put in that he didn&apos;t see why they mightn&apos;t sell to him as well as
                        to Bob Walker. Cynthy Ann had worked fer Mrs. Anderson fer years, and him and Cynthy was
                        a-goin&apos; to be one man soon. Why not sell to them?</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because selling to you is selling to Andrew,&quot; said Mrs. Abigail, in a
                        conclusive way.</p>
                    <p>And so Bob got the farms, possession to be given after the fourteenth of August, thus giving the
                        day of doom three days of grace. And Bob rode round the county boasting that he was as rich a
                        man as there was in Clark Township. And Jonas de clared that ef the eend did come in the month
                        of August, Abigail would find some onsettled bills agin her fer cheatin the brother outen the
                        inheritance. And Clark Township agreed with him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-240" n="255"/>
                    <p>August was secretly pleased that one obstacle to his marriage was gone. If Andrew should prove
                        right, and the world should outlast the middle of August, there would be nothing dishonorable in
                        his marrying a girl that would have nothing to sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Andrew, for his part, gave vent to his feelings, as usual, by two or three bitter remarks leveled
                        at the whole human race, of several people, of whom Julia stood first. She was a woman of the
                        old-fashioned kind, he said, fit to go alongside Heloise or Chaucer&apos;s Grisilde.</p>

                        August came on. yield to the panic, showed its effects on them by deeper potations, and by a
                        recklessness of wickedness meant to conceal their fears. &quot;With tin horns they
                        blasphemously affected to be angels blowing trumpets. They imitated the Millerite meetings in
                        their drunken sprees, and learned Mr. Hankins&apos;s arguments by heart.</p>
                    <p>The sun of the eleventh of August rose gloriously. People pointed to it with trembling, and said
                        that it would rise no more. Soon after sunrise there were crimson clouds stretching above and
                        below it, and popular terror seized upon this as a sign. But the sun mounted with a scorching
                        heat, which showed that at least his shining power was not impaired. Then men said,
                        &quot;Behold the beginning of the fervent heat that is to melt the elements!&quot; Night
                        drew on, and every &quot;shooting-star&quot; was a new sign of the end. The meteors, as
                        usual at this time <pb id="VAA2341-242" n="257"/> of the year, were plentiful, and the
                        simple-hearted countryfolk were convinced that the stars were falling out of the sky.</p>
                    <p>A large bald hill overlooking the Ohio was to be the mount of ascension. Here gathered Elder
                        Hankins&apos;a flock with that comfortable assurance of being the elect that only a narrow
                        bigotry can give. And here came others of all denominations, consoling themselves that they were
                        just as well off if they were Christians aa if they had made all this fuss about the millennium.
                        Here was August, too, now almost well, joining with, the rest in singing those sweet and
                        Inspiring Adventist hymns. His German heart could not keep still where there was singing, and
                        now, in gratefulness at new-fonnd health, he was more inclined to music than ever. So he joined
                        heartily and sincerely in the song that begins: <q direct="unspecified">

                            </lg>
                        </q> neither August nor any one else could well resist the infection of the profound and awful
                        belief in the immediate coming of the end which pervaded the throng. Strong men and women wept
                        and shouted with the excitement.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-243" n="258"/>
                    <p>Then Elder Hankins exhorted a little. He said that the time was short. But men&apos;s hearts
                        were hard. As in the days of the flood, they were marrying and giving in marriage. Not half a
                        mile away a wedding was at that time taking place, and a man who called himself a minister could
                        not discern the signs of the times, but was solemnizing a marriage.</p>
                    <p>This allusion was to the marriage of Jonas, which was to take place that very evening at the
                        castle. Mrs. Anderson had refused to have &quot;such wicked nonsense&quot; at her house,
                        and as Cynthy had no home, Andrew had appointed it at the castle, partly to oblige Jonas, partly
                        from habitual opposition to Abigail, but chiefly to express his contempt for Adventism.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson herself was in a state of complete sublimation. She had sent for Norman, that she
                        might get him ready for the final judgment, and Norman, without the slightest inclination to be
                        genuinely religious, was yet a coward, and made a provisional repentance, not meant to hold good
                        if Elder Hankins&apos;s figures should fail; just such a repentance as many a man has made
                        on what he supposed to be his death-bed. Do not I remember a panic-stricken man, converted by
                        typhoid fever and myself, who laughed as soon as he began to eat gruel, to think that he had
                        been &quot;such a fool as to send for the preacher&quot;?</p>
                    <p>Now, between Mrs. Anderson&apos;s joy at Norman&apos;s conversion, and her delight that
                        the world would soon be at an end and she on the winning side, and her anticipation of the
                        pleasure she would feel even in heaven in saying, &quot;I told you so!&quot; to her
                        unbelieving friends, she quite forgot Julia. In fact she went from one fit of religious
                        catalepsy to another, falling into trances, or being struck down with what was mysteriously
                        called &quot;the power.&quot; She had relaxed her vigilance about Julia, <pb
                            id="VAA2341-244" n="259"/> for there were but three more hours of time, and she felt that
                        the goal was already gamed, and she had carried her point to the very last. A satisfaction for a
                        saint!</p>
                    <p>The neglected Julia naturally floated toward the outer edge of the surging crowd, and she and
                        August inevitably drifted together.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let us go and see Jonas married,&quot; said August. &quot;It is no harm. God
                        can take us to heaven from one place as well as another, if we are His children.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In truth, Julia was wearied and bewildered, not to say disgusted, with her mother&apos;s
                        peculiar religious exercises, and she gladly escaped with August to the castle and the wedding
                        of her faithful friends.</p>
                    <p>Andrew, in a spirit of skeptical defiance, had made his castle look as flowery and festive as
                        possible. The wedding took place IN the lower story, but the library was illuminated, and the
                        Adventists who had occasion to pass by Andrew&apos;s on their way to the rendezvous accepted
                        this as a new fulfillment of prophecy to the very letter. They nodded one to another, and said,
                        &quot;See! marrying and giving in marriage, as in the days of Noah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>August and Julia were too much awe-stricken to say much on their way to the castle. But in these
                        last hours of a world, grown old and ready for its doom, they cleaved closer together. There
                        could be neither heaven, nor millennium, for one of them without the other! Loving one another
                        made them love God the more, and love cast out all fear. If this was the Last, they would face
                        it together, and if it proved the Beginning, they would rejoice together. At sight of every
                        shooting meteor, Julia clung almost convulsively to August.</p>
                    <p>When they entered the castle, Jonas and Cynthy were already <pb id="VAA2341-245" n="260"/>
                        standing up before the presiding elder, and he was about to begin. Cynthy&apos;s face showed
                        her sense of the awfuluess of marrying at a moment of such fearful expectation, or perhaps she
                        was troubling herself for fear that so much happiness out of heaven was to be had only in the
                        commission of a capital sin. But, like most people whose consciences are stronger than their
                        intellects, she found great consolation in taking refuge under the wing, of ecclesiastical
                        authority. To be married by a presiding elder was the best thing in the world next to being
                        married by a bishop.</p>
                    <p>Whatever fear of the swift-coming judgment others might have felt, the benignant old elder was at
                        peace. Commonsense, a clean conscience, and a child-like faith enlightened his countenance, and
                        since he tried to be always ready, and since his meditations made the things of the other life
                        ever present, his pulse would scarcely have quickened if he had felt sure that the
                        archangel&apos;s trump would sound in an hour. He neither felt the subdued fear shown on the
                        countenance of Cynthy Ann, nor the strong skeptical opposition of Andrew, whose face of late had
                        grown almost into a sneer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you take this woman to be your lawful and wedded wife&quot;</p>
                    <p>And before the elder could finish it, Jonas blurted out, &quot;You&apos;d better believe
                        I do, my friend.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And then when the old man smiled and finished his question down to, &quot;so long&apos;
                        as ye both shall live,&quot; Jonas responded eagerly, &quot;Tell death er the
                        jedgment-day, long or short.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Cynthy Ann answered demurely out of her frightened but too happy heart, and the old man gave
                        them his benediction in an apostolic fashion that removed Cynthy Ann&apos;s scruples, and
                            <pb id="VAA2341-246" n="261"/> smoothed a little of the primness out of her face, so that
                        she almost smiled, when Jonas said, &quot;Well! it&apos;s done now, and it
                        can&apos;t be undone fer all the Gosliorns in Christendom er creation!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And then the old gentlemanfor he was a gentleman, though he had always &quot;been a
                        backwoodsmanspoke of the excitement, and said that it was best always to &quot;be readyto be
                        ready to live, and then you would be ready for death or the judgment. That very night the end
                        might come, but it was not best to trouble one&apos;s self about it. And he smiled, and said
                        that it was none of hia business, God could manage the universe; it was for him to be found
                        doing his duty as a faithful servant. And then it would be just like stepping out of one door
                        into another, whenever death or the judgment should come.</p>
                    <p>While the old man was getting ready to leave, Julia and August slipped away, fearing lest their
                        absence should be discovered. But the peacefulness of the old elder&apos;s face had entered
                        into their souls, and they wished that they too were solemnly pronounced man and wife, with so
                        sweet a benediction upon their union.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not feel much anxious about the day of judgment or the millennium,&quot; said
                        August, whose idiom was sometimes a little broken. &quot;When I was so near dying I felt
                        satisfied to die after you had kissed my lips. But now that it seems we have come upon the
                        world&apos;s last days, I wish I were married to you. I do not know how things will be in
                        the new heaven and the new earth. But I should like you to be my wife there, or at least to have
                        been my wife on earth, if only for one hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And then he proposed that they should be made man and wife now in the world&apos;s last hour.
                        It was not wrong. It could not <pb id="VAA2341-247" n="262"/> give her mother heart-disease, for
                        she would not know of it till she should hear it in the land where there are neither marriages
                        nor sickness. Julia could not see any sin in her disobedience under such circumstances. She did
                        so much want to go into the New Jerusalem as the wedded wife of August &quot;the
                        grand,&quot; as she fondly called him.</p>
                    <p>And so in the stillness of that awful night they walked back to Andrew&apos;s castle, and
                        found the venerable preacher, with saddle-bags on his arm, ready to mount his horse, for the
                        presiding elder of that day had no leisure time. Jonas and Cynthy stood bidding him good-by. And
                        the old man was saying again that if we were always ready it would be like stepping from one
                        door into another. But he thought it as wrong to waste time gazing np into heaven to see Christ
                        come, as it had been to gaze after Him when He went away. Even Jonas&apos;s voice was a
                        little softened by the fearful thought ever present of the corning on of that awful midnight of
                        the eleventh of August. All were surprised to see the two young people come back.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father Williams,&quot; said August, &quot;we thought we should like to go into
                        the New Jerusalem man and wife. Will you marry us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sensible to the last!&quot; cried Jonas.</p>
                    <p>&quot;According to the laws of this State,&quot; said Mr. Williams, &quot;you can not
                        be married without a license from the clerk of the county. Have you a license?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said August, his heart sinking.</p>
                    <p>Just then Andrew came up and inquired what the conversation was about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Uncle Andrew,&quot; said Julia eagerly, &quot;August and I don&apos;t
                        want the end of the world to come without being man and <pb id="VAA2341-248" n="263"/> wife. And
                        we have no license, and August could not go seven miles and back to get a license before
                        midnight. It is too bad, isn&apos;t it? If it wasn&apos;t that we think the end of the
                        world is so near, I should be ashamed to say how much I want to be married. But I shall be proud
                        to have been August&apos;s wife, when I am among the angels.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ton are a noblewoman,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;Come in, let us see if anything
                        can be done,&quot; And he led the way, smiling.</p>

                    <p>W<hi rend="sc">HEN</hi> they had all re-entered the castle, Andrew made them sit down. The old
                        minister did not see any escape from the fatal obstacle of a lack of license, &quot;but
                        Andrew-was very, mysterious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Virtue is its own reward,&quot; said the Philosopher, &quot;but it often finds
                        an incidental reward besides. Now, Julia, you are the noblest woman in these degenerate times,
                        according to my way of thinking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s true as preachin&apos;, ef yon&apos;ll except one,&quot;
                        chirped Jonas, with a significant look at his Cynthy Ann. Julia blushed, and the old minister
                        looked inquiringly at Andrew and at Julia. This exaggerated praise from a man so misanthropic as
                        Andrew excited his curiosity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Without exception,&quot; said Andrew emphatically, looking first at Jonas, then at
                        Mr. Williams, &quot;my niece is the noblest woman I ever knew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t, Uncle Andrew!&quot; begged Julia, almost speechless with
                        shame. Praise was something she could not bear. She was inured to censure.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-250" n="265"/>
                    <p>&quot;Do you remember that dark nightof course you dowhen you braved everything and came here
                        to see August, who would have died but for your coming? &quot;Andrew was now looking at
                        Julia, who answered him almost inaudibly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And do you remember when we got to your gate, on your return, what you said to
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Julia.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To be sure you do, and&quot; (turning to August) &quot;I shall never forget her
                        words; she said,&quot; If he should get worse, I should like him to die my husband, if he
                        wishes it. Send for me, day or night, and I will come in spite of everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you say that?&quot; asked August, looking at her eagerly. And Julia nodded her
                        head, and lifted her eyes, glistening with brimming tears, to his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do not know,&quot; said Andrew to the preacher, &quot;how much her proposal
                        meant, for you do not know through what she would have had to pass. But I say that God does
                        sometimes reward virtue in this worlda world not quite worn out yet and she is worthy of the
                        reward in store for her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Saying this, Andrew went into the closet leading to his secret stairwaysecret no longer, since
                        Julia had ascended by that wayand soon came down from his library with a paper in his hand.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When you, my noble-hearted niece, proposed to make any sacrifice to marry this
                        studious, honest, true-hearted German gentleman, who is worthy of you, if any man can be, I
                        thought best to be ready for any emergency, and so I went the next day and procured the license,
                        the clerk promising to keep my secret. A marriage-license is good for thirty days. You will see,
                        Mr. Williams, that this has not quite expired.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-251" n="266"/>
                    <p>The minister looked at it and then said, &quot;I depend on your judgment, Mr. Anderson. There
                        seems to be something peculiar about the circumstances of this marriage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very peculiar,&quot; said Andrew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You give me your word, then, that it is a marriage I ought to solemnize?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The lady is my niece,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;The marriage, taking place in
                        this castle, will shed more glory upon it than its whole history beside 5 and you, sir, have
                        never performed a marriage ceremony in a case where the marriage was so excellent as
                        this.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except the last one,&quot; put in Jonas.</p>
                    <p>I suppose Mr. Williams made the proper reductions for Andrew&apos;s enthusiasm. But he was
                        satisfied, and perhaps he was rather inclined to be satisfied, for gentle-hearted old men are
                        quite susceptible to a romantic situation.</p>
                    <p>When he asked August if he would live with this woman in holy matrimony &quot;so long as ye
                        both shall live, &quot;August, thinking the two hours of time left to him too short for the
                        earnestness of his vows, looked the old minister in the eyes, and said solemnly: &quot;For
                        ever and ever!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, my son,&quot; said the old man, smiling and almost weeping, &quot;that is
                        not the right answer, I like your whole-hearted love. But it is far easier to say for ever and
                        ever,&apos; standing as you think you do now on the brink of eternity, than to say
                        &apos;till death do us part,&apos; looking down a long and weary road of toil and
                        sickness and poverty and change and little vexations. You do not only take this woman, young and
                        blooming, but old and sick and withered and wearied, perhaps. Do you take her for any
                        lot?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-252" n="267"/>
                    <p>&quot;For any lot,&quot; said August solemnly and humbly.</p>
                    <p>And Julia, on her part, could only bow her head in reply to the questions, for the tears chased
                        one another down her cheeks. And then came the benediction. The inspired old man, full of hearty
                        sympathy, stretched his trembling hands with apostolic solemnity over the heads of the two, and
                        said slowly, with solemn pauses, as the words welled up out of his soul: &quot;The peace of
                        Godthat passeth all understanding&quot; (here his voice melted with emotion)&quot;keep
                        your heartsand mindsin the knowledge and love of God. And now, may gracemercy and peace from
                            God<hi rend="i">the Father</hi>and <hi rend="i">our</hi> Lord Jesus Christbe with
                        youevermoreAmen!&quot; And to the imagination of Julia the Spirit of God descended like a
                        dove into her heart, and the great mystery of wifely love and the other greater mystery of love
                        to God seemed to flow together in her soul. And the quieter spirit of August was suffused with a
                        great peace.</p>
                    <p>They soon left the castle to return to the mount of ascension, but they walked slowly, and at
                        first silently, over the intervening hill, which gave them a view of the Ohio River, sleeping in
                        its indescribable beauty and stillness in the moonlight.</p>
                    <p>Presently they heard the melodious voice of the old presiding elder, riding up the road a little
                        way off, singing the hopeful hymns in which he so much delighted. The rich and earnest voice
                        made the woods ring with one verse of <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">&quot;Oh t how happy are they</l>

                        <pb id="VAA2341-253" n="268"/> And then he broke into Watts&apos;s <q direct="unspecified">
                            <lg>
                                <l n="7">&quot;When I can read my title clear</l>

                            </lg>
                        </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>There seemed to be some accord between the singing of the brave old man and the peacefulness of
                        the landscape. Soon he had reached the last stanza, and in tones of subdued but ecstatic triumph
                        he sang:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">&quot;There I shall bathe my weary soul</l>
                        <l n="2">In seas of heavenly rest,</l>
                        <l n="3">And not a wave of trouble roll</l>
                        <l n="4">Across my peaceful breast.&quot;</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>And with these words he passed round the hill and out of the hearing of the young people.</p>
                    <p>&quot;August,&quot; said Julia slowly, as if afraid to break a silence so blessed,
                        &quot;August, it seems to me that the sky and the river and the hazy hills and my own soul
                        are all alike, just as full of happiness and peace as they can be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said August, smiling, &quot;but the sky is clear, and your eyes are
                        raining, Julia. But can it be possible that God, who made this world so beautiful, will burn it
                        up to-night? It used to seem a hard world to me when I was away from you, and I didn&apos;t
                        care how quickly it burned up. But now&quot;</p>
                    <p>Somehow August forgot to finish that sentence. Words are of so little use under such
                        circumstances. A little pressure on Julia&apos;s arm which was in his, told all that he
                        meant. &quot;When love makes earth a heaven, it is enough.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But how beautiful the new earth will be,&quot; said Julia, still looking at the
                        sleeping river, &quot;the river of life will be clear as crystal!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-254" n="269"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said August, &quot;the Spanish version says,&apos; Most
                        resplendent, like unto crystal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think,&quot; said. Julia, &quot;that it must be something like this river.
                        The trees of life will stand on either side, like those great sycamores that lean over the water
                        so gracefully.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Any landscape would have seemed heavenly to Julia on this night. A venerable friend of mine, a
                        true Christian philanthropist, whose praise is in all the churches, wants me to undertake to
                        reform fictitious literature by leaving out the love. And so I may when God reforms His universe
                        by leaving ont the love. Love is the best thing in novels; not until love is turned out of
                        heaven will I help turn it out of literature. It is only the misrepresentation of love in
                        literature that is bad, as the poisoning of love in life is bad. It was the love of August that
                        had opened Julia&apos;s heart to the influences of heaven, and Julia was to August a
                        mediator of God&apos;s grace.</p>
                    <p>By eleven o&apos;clock August Wehle and his wifeit gives me nearly as much pleasure as it did
                        August to use that locution were standing not far away from the surging crowd of those who, in
                        singing hymns and in excited prayer, were waiting for the judgment Jonas and Cynthy and Andrew
                        were with them. August, though not a recognized Millerite, almost blamed himself that he should
                        have been away these two hours from the services. But why should he? The most sacramental of all
                        the sacraments is marriage. Is it not an arbitrary distinction of theologians, that which makes
                        two rites to be sacraments and others not? But if the distinction is to be made at all, I should
                        apply the solemn word to the solemnest rite and the holiest ordinance of God&apos;s, even if
                        I left out the sacred washing in the name of the Trinity and the broken emblematic bread and the
                        wine. These <pb id="VAA2341-255" n="270"/> are sacramental in their solemn symbolism, that in
                        the solemnest symbolism and the holiest reality.</p>
                    <p>August&apos;s whole attention was now turned toward the coming judgment; and as he stood
                        thinking of the awfulneas of this critical moment, the exercises of the Adventists grated on the
                        deep peacefulness of his spirit, for from singing their more beautiful hymns, they had passed to
                        an excited shouting of the old camp-meeting ditty whose refrain is:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope to shout glory when this world&apos;s all on fire I Hallelujah!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He and Julia hung back a moment, but Mrs. Abigail, who had recovered from her tenth trance, and
                        had been for some time engaged in an active search for Julia, now pounced upon her, and bore her
                        off, before she had time to think, to the place of the hottest excitement.</p>

                    <p>A<hi rend="sc">T</hi> last the time drew on toward midnight, the hour upon which all expectation
                        was concentrated. For did not the Parable of the Ten Virgins speak, of the coming of the
                        bridegroom at midnight?</p>
                    <p>&quot;My friends and brethren,&quot; said Elder Hankins, his voice shaking with emotion,
                        as he held his watch up in the moonlight, &quot;My friends and brethren, ef the Word is
                        true, they is but five minutes more before the comin&apos; in of the new dispensation. Let
                        us spend the last moments of time in silent devotion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder ef he thinks the world runs down by his paytent-leever watch?&quot; said
                        Jonas, who could not resist the impulse to make the remark, even with the expectation of the
                        immediate coming of the day of judgment in his mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder for what longitude he calculates prophecy?&quot; said Andrew. &quot;It
                        can not be midnight all round the world at the same moment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Elder Hankins&apos;s flock did not take any astronomical difficulty into consideration.
                        And no spectator could look upon them, bowing silently in prayer, awed by the expectation of the
                        suddea <pb id="VAA2341-257" n="272"/> coming of the Lord, without feeling that, however much the
                        expectation might toe illusory, the emotion was a fact absolutely awful. Events are only sublime
                        as they move the human soul, and the swift-coming end of time was subjectively a great reality
                        to these waiting people. Even Andrew was awe-stricken from sympathy; as Coleridge, when he stood
                        godfather for Keble&apos;s child, was overwhelmed with a sense of the significance of the
                        sacrament from Keble&apos;s stand-point. As for Cynthy Ann, she trembled with fear as she
                        held fast to the arm of Jonas. And Jonas felt as much seriousness as was possible to him, until
                        he heard Norman Anderson&apos;s voice crying with terror and excitement, and felt Cynthy
                        shudder on his arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fer my part,&quot; said Jonas, turning to Andrew, &quot;it don&apos;t seem
                        like as ef it was much use to holler and make a furss about the corn crap when
                        October&apos;s fairly sot in, and the frost has nipped the blades. All the plowin&apos;
                        and hoein&apos; and weedin&apos; and thinnin&apos; out the suckers won&apos;t
                        better the yield then. Aa&apos; when wheat&apos;s ripe, they&apos;s nothin&apos;
                        to be done fer it. It&apos;s got to be rep jest as it stan&apos;s. I&apos;m rale
                        sorry, to-night, as my life a&apos;n&apos;t no better, but what&apos;s the use of
                        cryin&apos; over it? They&apos;s nothin&apos; to do now but let it be gethered and
                        shelled out, and measured up in the standard half-bushel of the sanctuary. And I&apos;m
                        afeard they&apos;ll be a heap of nubbins not wuth the shuckin&apos;. But ef it
                        don&apos;t come to six bushels the acre, I can&apos;t help it now by takin&apos;
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At twelve o&apos;clock, even the scoffers were silent. But as the sultry night drew on toward
                        one o&apos;clock, Bill Day and his party felt their spirits revive a little. The calculation
                        had failed in one part, and it might in all. Bill resumed his burlesque exhortations to the
                        rough-looking &quot;brethren&quot; about him. He tried to ead them in singing some
                        ribald parody of Adventist hymns, <pb id="VAA2341-258" n="273"/> but his terror and theirs was
                        too genuine, and their voices died down into husky whispers, and they were more alarmed than
                        ever at discovering the extent of their own demoralization. The bottle, one of those
                        small-necked, big-bodied quart-bottles that Western topers carry in yellow-cotton handkerchiefs,
                        was passed round. But even the whisky seemed powerless to neutralize their terror, rather
                        increasing the panic by fuddling their faculties.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Boys!&quot; said Bob Short, trembling, and sitting down on a stump,
                        &quot;thisthis ere thingis a gittin&apos; serious. Efwell, ef it <hi rend="i">was</hi>
                        to happenyou knowyou don&apos;t s&apos;poseahemyou don&apos;t think God
                        A&apos;mighty would be <hi rend="i">too</hi> heavy on a feller. Do ye? Ef it was to come
                        to-night, it would be blamed short notice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>At one o&apos;clock the moon was just about dipping behind the hills, and the great
                        sycamores, standing like giant sentinels on the river&apos;s marge, cast long unearthly
                        shadows across the water, which grew blacker every minute. The deepening gloom gave all objects
                        in the river valley a weird, distorted look. This oppressed August. The landscape seemed an
                        enchanted one, a something seen in a dream or a delirium. It was as though the change had
                        already come, and the real tangible world had passed away. He was the more susceptible from the
                        depression caused by the hot sultriness of the night, and his separation from Julia.</p>
                    <p>He thought he would try to penetrate the crowd to the point where his mother was; then he would
                        be near her, and nearer to Julia if anything happened. A curious infatuation had taken hold of
                        August. He knew that it was an infatuation, but he could not shake it off. He had resolved that
                        in case the trumpet should be heard in the heavens, he would seize Julia and claim her in the
                        very moment of universal dissolution. He reached bis mother, and as he looked into her calm
                        face, ready <pb id="VAA2341-259" n="274"/> for the millennium or for anything else &quot;the
                        Father&quot; should decree, he thought she had never seemed more glorious than she did now,
                        sitting with her children about her, almost unmoved by the excitement. For Mrs. Wehle had come
                        to take everything as from the Heavenly Father. She had even received honest but thick-headed
                        Gottlieb in this spirit, when he had fallen to her by the Moravian lot, a husband chosen for her
                        by the Lord, whose will was not to be questioned.</p>
                    <p>August was just about to speak to his mother, when he was forced to hang his head in shame, for
                        there was his father rising to exhort.</p>

                        vail already, and ton&apos;t let de debil git no unter holts on ye. Vatch and pe
                        retty!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And August could hear the derisive shouts of Bill Day&apos;s party, who had recovered their
                        courage, crying ont, &quot;Go it, ole Dutchman! I&apos;ll bet on you!&quot; He
                        clenched his fist in anger, but his mother&apos;s eyes, looking at him with quiet rebuke,
                        pacified him in a moment. Yet he could not help wondering whether blundering kinsfolk made
                        people blush in the next world.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Holt on doo de last ent!&quot; continued Gottlieb. &quot;It&apos;s pout
                        goom! Kood pye, ole moon! You koes town, you nebber gooms pack no more already.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This exhortation might have proceeded in this strain indefinitely, to the mortification of August
                        and the amusement of the profane, had? there not just at that moment broken upon the sultry
                        stillness of the night one of those crescendo thunder-bursts, beginning in a distant rumble, and
                        swelling out louder and still louder, until it ended with a tremendous detonation. In the
                        strange light of the setting moon, while everybody&apos;s attention <pb id="VAA2341-260"
                            n="275"/> was engrossed by the excitement, the swift oncoming of a thunder-cloud had not
                        been observed by any but Andrew, and it had already climbed half-way to the zenith, blotting out
                        a third of the firmament. This inverted thunder-bolt produced a startling effect upon the
                        over-strained nerves of the crowd. Some cried out with terror, some sobbed with hysterical
                        agony, some shouted in triumph, and it was generally believed that Virginia Waters, who died a
                        maniac many years afterward, lost her reason at that moment. Bill Day ceased his mocking, and
                        shook till his teeth chattered. And none of his party dared laugh at him. The moon had now gone,
                        and the vivid lightning followed the thunder, and yet louder and more fearful thunder succeeded
                        the lightning. The people ran about as if demented, and Julia was left alone. August had only
                        one thought in all this confusion, and that was to find Julia. Having found her, they clasped
                        hands, and stood upon the brow of the hill calmly watching the coming tempest, believing it to
                        be the coming of the end. Between the claps of thunder they could hear the broken sentences of
                        Elder Hankins, saying something about the lightning that shineth from one part of heaven to the
                        other, and about the promised coming in the clouds. But they did not much heed the words. They
                        were looking the blinding lightning in the face, and in their courageous trust they thought
                        themselves ready to look into the flaming countenance of the Almighty, if they should be called
                        before Him. Every fresh burst of thunder seemed to August to be the rocking of the world,
                        trembling in the throes of dissolution. But the world might crumble or melt; there is something
                        more enduring than the world. August felt the everlastingness of love; as many another man in a
                        supreme crisis has felt it.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-261" n="276"/>
                    <p>But the swift cloud bad already covered half the sky, and the bursts of thunder followed one
                        another now in quicker succession. And as suddenly as the thunder had come, came the wind. A
                        solitary old sycamore, leaning over the water on the Kentucky shore, a mile away, was first to
                        fall. In the lurid darkness, August and Julia saw it meet its fate. Then the rail fences on the
                        nearer bank were scattered like kindling-wood, and some of the sturdy old apple-trees of the
                        orchard in the river-bottom were uprooted, while others were stripped of their boughs. Julia
                        clung to August and said something, but he could only see her lips move; her voice was drowned
                        by the incessant roar of the thunder. And then the hurricane struck them, and they half-ran and
                        were half-carried down the rear slope of the hill. Now they saw for the first time that the
                        people were gone. The instinct of self-preservation had proven, stronger than their fanaticism,
                        and a contagious panic had carried them into a hay-barn near by.</p>
                    <p>Not knowing where the rest had gone, August and Julia only thought of regaining the castle. They
                        found the path blocked by fallen trees, and it was slow and dangerous work, waiting for flashes
                        of lightning to show them their road. In making a long detour they lost the path. After some
                        minutes, in a lull in the thunder, August heard a shout, which he answered, and presently
                        Philosopher Andrew appeared with a lantern, his grizzled hair and beard flying in the wind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What ho, my friends!&quot; he cried.&quot; This is the way you go to heaven
                        together! You&apos;ll live through many a storm yet!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Guided by his thorough knowledge of the ground, they had almost reached the castle, when they
                        were startled by piteous cries. Leaving August with Julia, Andrew climbed a fence, and <pb
                            id="VAA2341-262" n="277"/> went down into a ravine to find poor Bill Day in an agony of
                        terror, crying out in despair, believing that the day of doom had already come, and that he was
                        about to be sent into welldeserved perdition. Andrew stooped over him with his lantern, but the
                        poor fellow, giving one look at the shaggy face, shrieked madly, and rushed away into the woods.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe,&quot; said the Philosopher, when he got back to August, &quot;I
                        believe he took me for the devil.&quot;</p>

                    <p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> summer storm had spent itself by daylight, and the sun rose on that
                        morning after the world&apos;s end much as it had risen on other mornings, but it looked
                        down upon prostrate trees and scattered fences and roofless barns. And the minds of the people
                        were in much the same disheveled state as the landscape. One simpleminded girl was a maniac,
                        Some declared that the world had ended, and that this was the new earth, if people only had
                        faith to receive it; some still waited for the end, and with some the reaction, from credulity
                        had already set in, a reaction that carried them into the blankest atheism and boldest
                        immorality. People who had spent the summer in looking for a change that would relieve them from
                        all responsibility, now turned reluctantly toward the commonplace drudgery of life. It is the
                        evil of all day-dreamingday-dreaming about the other world included that it unfits us for duty
                        in this world of tangible and inevitable facts.</p>
                    <p>It was nearly daylight when Andrew and August and Julia reached the castle. The Philosopher
                        advised Julia to go home, <pb id="VAA2341-264" n="279"/> and for the present to let the marriage
                        be as though it were not. August dreaded to see Julia returned to her mother&apos;s tyranny,
                        but Andrew was urgent in his advice, and Julia said that she must not leave her mother in her
                        trouble. Julia reached home a little after daylight, and a little before Mrs. Anderson was
                        brought home in a fit of hysterics.</p>
                    <p>Poor Mrs. Abigail still hoped that the end of the world for which she had so fondly prepared
                        would come, but as the days wore on she sank into a numb despondency. When she thought of the
                        loss of her property, she groaned and turned her face to the wall. And Samuel Anderson sat about
                        the house in a dumb and shiftless attitude, as do most men upon whom financial rum conies in
                        middle life. The disappointment of his faith and the overthrow of his fortune had completely
                        paralyzed him. He was waiting for something, he hardly knew what. He had not even his
                        wife&apos;s driving voice to stimulate him to exertion.</p>
                    <p>There was no one now to care for Mrs, Anderson but Julia, for Cynthy had taken up her abode in
                        the log-cabin which Jonas had bought, and a happier housekeeper never lived. She watched Jonas
                        till he disappeared when he went to work in the morning, she carried him a
                        &quot;snack&quot; at ten o&apos;clock, and he always found her standing
                        &quot;like, a picter&quot; at the gate, when he came home to dinner. But Cyuthy Ann
                        generally spent her afternoons at Anderson&apos;s, helping &quot;that young
                        thing&quot; to bear her responsibilities, though Mrs. Anderson, would receive no personal
                        attentions now from any one but her daughter. She did not scold; her querulous restlessness was
                        but a reminiscence of her scolding. She lay, disheartened, watching Julia, and exacting
                        everything from Julia, and the weary feet and weary heart of the girl almost sank under her
                        burdens. Mrs. Anderson had suddenly fallen <pb id="VAA2341-265" n="280"/> from her position of
                        an exacting tyrant to that of an exacting and helpless infant. She followed Julia with her eyes
                        in a brokenspirited fashion, as if fearing that she would leave her. Julia could read the fear
                        in her mother&apos;s countenance; she understood what her mother meant when she said
                        querulously, &quot;You&apos;ll get married and leave me.&quot; If Mrs. Anderson had
                        assumed her old high-handed manner, it would have been easy for Julia to have declared her
                        secret But how could she tell her now? It would he a blow, it might be a fatal blow. And at the
                        same time how could she satisfy August? He thought she had bowed to the same old tyranny again,
                        for an indefinite time. But she could not forsake her parents in their poverty and afflictions;</p>
                    <p>The fourteenth of August, the day on which possession was to have been given to Bob Walker, came
                        and went, but no Bob Walker appeared. A week more passed, ha which Samuel Anderson could not
                        muster enough courage to go to see Walker, in which Samuel Anderson and his wife waited in a
                        vague hope that something might happen. And every day of that week Julia had a letter from
                        August, which did not say one word of the trial that it was for him to wait, but which said much
                        of the wrong Julia was doing to herself to submit so long. And Julia, like her father and
                        mother, was waiting for she knew not what.</p>
                    <p>At last the suspense became to her unendurable,</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father,&quot; she said, &quot;why don&apos;t you go to see Bob
                        &quot;Walker? You might buy the farm back again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know why he don&apos;t come and take it,&quot; said Mr.
                        Anderson dejectedly.</p>
                    <p>This conversation roused Mrs. Abigail. There was some hope. She got up in bed, and told Samuel to
                        go to the county-seat and see if the deeds had ever been recorded. And while her husband <pb
                            id="VAA2341-266" n="281"/> was gone she sat up and looked better, and even scolded a little,
                        so that Julia felt encouraged. But she dreaded to see her father come back.</p>
                    <p>Samuel Anderson entered the house on his return with a blank countenance. Sitting down, he put
                        his face between his hands a minute in utter dejection.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you speak?&quot; said Mrs. Anderson in a broken voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The land was all transferred to Andrew immediately, and he owns every foot of it. He
                        must have sent Bob Walker here to buy it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! I&apos;m. so glad!&quot; cried Julia.</p>
                    <p>But her mother only gave her one reproachful look and went off into hysterical sobbing and crying
                        over the wrong that Andrew had done her. And all that night Julia watched by her mother, while
                        Samuel Anderson sat in dejection by the &quot;bed. As for Norman, he had quickly relapsed
                        into his old habits, and his former cronies had generously forgiven him his temporary piety,
                        considering the peculiar circumstances of the case some extenuation. Now that there was trouble
                        in the house he staid away, which was a good thing so far as it went.</p>
                    <p>The next afternoon Mrs. Anderson rallied a little, and, looking at Julia, she said in her
                        querulous way, &quot;Why don&apos;t you go and see him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who?&quot; said Julia with a shiver, afraid that her mother was insane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Andrew.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia did not need any second hint. Leaving her mother with Cynthy, she soon presented herself at
                        the door of the castle.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did <hi rend="i">she</hi> send you? &quot;asked Andrew dryly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-267" n="282"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been expecting you for a long time. I&apos;ll go back with you. But
                        August must go along. He&apos;ll be glad of an excuse to see your face again. You look thin,
                        my poor girl.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went past Wehle&apos;s, and August was only too glad to join them, rejoicing that some
                        sort of a crisis had come, though how it was to help him he did not know. With the restlessness
                        of a man looking for some indefinable thing to turn up, Samuel was out on the porch waiting the
                        return of his daughter. Jonas had come for Cynthy Ann, and was sitting on a
                        &quot;shuck-bottom&quot; chair in front of the house.</p>
                    <p>Andrew reached out his hand and greeted his brother cordially, and spoke civilly to Abigail. Then
                        there wae a pause, and Mrs. Anderson turned her head to the wall and groaned. After a while she
                        looked round and saw August. A little of her old indignation came into her eyes as she
                        whimpered, &quot;What did <hi rend="i">he</hi> come for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I brought him,&quot; said Andrew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it&apos;s your house, do as you please. I suppose you&apos;ll turn us out
                        of our own home now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As you did me,&quot; said the Philosopher, smiling. &quot;Let me remind you
                        that I was living on the fiver farm. My father had promised it to me, and given me possession. A
                        week before his death you got the will changed, by what means you know. You turned me off the
                        farm which had virtually been mine for two years. If I turn you off now, it will be no more than
                        fair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a look of pained surprise on Julia&apos;s face. She had not known that the wrong
                        her uncle had suffered was so great. She had not thought that he would be so severe as to turn
                        her father out.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-268" n="283"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to talk of these things,&quot; Andrew went on.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I ought to have broken the will, but I was not a believer in the law. I tell this story
                        now because I must justify myself to these young people for what I am going to do. You have had
                        the use of that part of the estate which was rightfully mine for twenty years. I suppose I may
                        claim it all now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia&apos;s eyes looked at him pleadingly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you send us off and be done with it then? &quot;said Mrs.
                        Abigail, rising up and resuming her old vehemence.&quot; You set out to ruin us, and now
                        you&apos;ve done it. A nice brother you are! Ruining us by a conspiracy with Bob Walker, and
                        then sitting here and trying to make my own daughter think you did right, and bringing that
                        hateful fellow here to hear it!&quot; Her finger was leveled at August.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am glad to see you are better, Abigail. I wanted to be sure you were strong enough to
                        bear all I have to say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Say your worst and do your worst, you cruel, cruel man! I have borne enough from you in
                        these years, and now you can say and do what you please; you can&apos;t do me any more harm.
                        I suppose I must leave my old home that I&apos;ve lived in so long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You need not worry yourself about leaving; that&apos;s what I came over to
                        say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As if I&apos;d stay in <hi rend="i">your</hi> house an hour! I&apos;ll not take
                        any favors at <hi rend="i">your</hi> hand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be rash, Abigail. I have deeded this hill farm to Samuel, and here is
                        the deed. I have given you back the best half of the property, just what my father meant you to
                        have. I have only kept the river land, that should have been mine twenty years ago. I hope you
                        will not stick to your resolution not to receive anything at my hand.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-269" n="284"/>
                    <p>And Jsulia said: &quot;Oh! I&apos;m so&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Mrs. Anderson had a convenient fit of hysterics, crying piteously. Meantime Samuel gladly
                        accepted the deed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The deed is already recorded. I sent it down yesterday as soon as I saw Samuel come
                        back, and I got it back this morning. The farm is yours without condition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This relieved Abigail, and she soon ceased her sobbing. Andrew could not take it back then,
                        whatever she might say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I have only divided the farms without claiming
                        any damages. I want to ask a favor. Let Julia marry the man of her choice in peaee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You have taken one farm, and therefore I must let my daughter marry a man with nothing
                        but his two hands,&quot; sobbed Mrs. Anderson.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Two hands and a good head and a noble heart,&quot; said Andrew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I won&apos;t consent,&quot; said she. &quot;If Julia marries <hi
                            rend="i">him</hi>&quot; pointing to August, &quot;she will marry without my consent,
                        and he will not get a cent of the money he&apos;s after. Not a red cent!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want your money. I did not know you&apos;d get your farm back, for
                        I did not know but that &quot;Walker owned it, and IwantedJulia all the same.&quot;
                        August had almost told that he had married Julia.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wanted her and married her,&quot; said Andrew.&quot; And I have not kept a
                        corn-stalk of the property I got from you. I have given Bob Walker a ten-acre patch for his
                        services, and all the rest I have deeded to the two best people I know. This August Wehle
                        married Julia Anderson when they thought the world might be near its end, and believing that, at
                        any rate, she would <pb id="VAA2341-270" n="299"/> not have a penny in the world. I have deeded
                        the river farm to August &quot;Wehle and his wife.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Married, eh? Come and ask my consent afterwards? That&apos;s a fine way!&quot;
                        And Abigail grew white and grew silent with passion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come, August, I want to show you and Julia something,&quot; said Andrew. He really
                        wanted to give Abigail time to look the matter in the face quietly before she committed herself
                        too far. But he told the two young people that they might make their home with him while their
                        house was in building. He had already had part of the material drawn, and from the brow of the
                        hill they looked down upon the site he had chosen near the old tumble-down tenant&apos;s
                        house. But Andrew saw that Julia looked disappointed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not satisfied, my brave girl. What is the matter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! yes, I am very happy, and very thankful to you; and next to August I love you more
                        than anybodyexcept my parents.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But something is different to what you wished it. Doesn&apos;t the site suit you?
                        You can look off on to the river from the rise on which the house will stand, and I do not know
                        how it could be better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It couldn&apos;t be better,&quot; said Julia, &quot;but&apos;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But what? You must tell me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought maybe you&apos;d let us live at the castle and take the burden of things
                        off you. I should like to keep your house for you, just to show you how much I love my dear,
                        good uncle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Even an anchorite could not help feeling a pleasure at such a speech from such a young woman, and
                        this shaggy, solitary, misanthropic but tender-hearted man felt a sadden rush of pleasure.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-271" n="286"/>
                    <p>August saw it, and was delighted. What one&apos;s nearest friend thinks of one&apos;s
                        wife is a vitalquestion, and August was happier at this moment than he had ever been.
                        Andrew&apos;s pleasure at</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; said the Philosopher, a little huskily. &quot;You want to sacrifice
                        your pleasure by living in my gloomy old castle, and civilizing an old heathen like me. You
                        mustn&apos;t tempt me too far.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see why you call it gloomy. It wasn&apos;t only for your sake that
                        I said it. I think it is the nicest old house I ever saw. And then the books,
                        andandyou.&quot; Julia stumbled a little, she was not accustomed to make speeches of this
                        sort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You flatterer!&quot; burst out Andrew. &quot;But no, you must have your own
                        house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Anderson, on her part, had concluded to make the best of it. Julia already married andthe
                        mistress of the Anderson river farm was quite a different thing from Julia under her thumb. She
                        was to be conciliated. Besides, Mrs. Anderson did not want Julia&apos;s prosperity to be a
                        lifelong source of humiliation to her. She must take some stock in it at the start.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jule,&quot; she said, as her daughter re-entered the door, &quot;I can let you
                        have two feather-beds and four pillows, and a good stock of linen and blankets. And you can have
                        the two heifers and the sorrel colt.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The two &quot;heifers &quot;were six, and the sorrel &quot;colt&quot; was seven
                        years of age; but descriptive names often outlive the qualities to which they owed their origin.
                        Just as a judge is even yet addressed as &quot;your honor,&quot; and many a governor
                        without anything to recommend him hears himself called &quot;your excellency.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Abigail surrendered in this graceful fashion, Julia was <pb id="VAA2341-272" n="287"/>
                        touched, and was on the point of putting her arms around her mother and kissing her. But Mrs.
                        Anderson was not a person easily caressed, and Julia did not yield to her impulse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Cyntliy Ann, my dear,&quot; said Jonas, as they walked home that evening,
                        &quot;do you know what Abig&apos;il Anderson reminds me of?&quot;</p>
                    <p>No; Cynthy Ann didn&apos;t exactly know. In fact, it would have been difficult for anybody to
                        have told what anything was likely to remind Jonas of. There was no knowing what a thing
                        mightnot suggest to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Cyntliy, my Imperial Sweetness, when I see Abig&apos;il come down so
                        beautiful, it reminded me of a little fice-t dog I had when I was a Icetle codger. I called him
                        Pick. His name was Picayune. Purty good name, wasn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, it was.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, now, that air little Pick wouldn&apos;t never own up as he was driv outen
                        tlic house. When he was whipped out, he nd run acrost the yard and through the fence and down
                        the road a-barkin&apos; fit to kill. &quot;Wanted to let on like as ef he&apos;d run
                        out of his own accord, with malice aforethought, you know. <hi rend="i">Thafa</hi>

                    <head type="main">CHAPTER XLV.</head>
                    <head type="subtitle">NEW PLANS.</head>
                    <p>E<hi rend="sc">XCEPT</hi> Abigail Anderson and one other person, everybody in the little world of
                        Clark township approved mightily the justice and disinterestedness of Andrew. He had righted
                        himself and Julia at a stroke, and people dearly love to have justice dealt out when it is not
                        at their own expense. Samuel, who cherished in secret a great love for his daughter, was
                        morethan pleased that affairs had turned out in this way. But August spent half the night in
                        protesting in vain against Andrew&apos;s transfer of the river-farm to him. But Andrew said
                        he had a right to give away his own if he chose. And there was no turning him. For if August
                        refused a share in it, he would give it to Julia, and if she refused it, he would find somebody
                        who wouldaccept it.</p>
                    <p>The next day after the settlement at Samuel Anderson&apos;s, August came to claim his wife.
                        Mrs. Abigail had now employed a &quot;help&quot; in Cynthy Ann&apos;s place, and
                        Julia could be spared. August had refused all invitations to take up his temporary residence
                        with Julia&apos;s parents. The house had unpleasant <pb id="VAA2341-274" n="289"/>
                        associations in his mind, and he wanted to relieve Julia at once and forever from a despotism to
                        which she could not offer any effectual resistance. Mrs. Anderson had eagerly loaded the wagon
                        with feather-beds and other bridal property, and sent it over to the castle, that Julia might
                        appear to leave with her blessing. She kissed Julia tenderly, and hoped she&apos;dhave a
                        happy life, and told her that if her husband should ever lose his property or treat her
                        badlysuch thing <hi rend="i">may</hi> happen, you knowthen she would aleays find a home with her
                        mother. Julia thanked her for the offer of a refuge to which she never meant to flee under any
                        circumstance. And yet one never turns away from one&apos;s home without regret, and Julia
                        looked back with tears in her eyes at the chattcring swifts whose nests were in the parlor
                        chimney, and at the pee-wee chirping on the gate-post. The place had entered into her life. It
                        looked lonesome now, but within a year afterward Norman suddenly married Betsey Malcolm.
                        Betsey&apos;schild had died soon after its birth,-and Mrs. Anderson set herself to manage
                        both Norman and his wife, who took up their abode with her. Nothing but a reign of terror could
                        have made either of them of any account, but Mrs. Anderson furnished them this in any desirable
                        quantity. They were never of much worth, even under her management, but little and them in
                        bounds, so that Norman ceased to get drunk more than five or six times a year, and Betsey
                        flirted but little and at her peril.</p>
                    <p>Once the old house was out of sight, there were no shadows on Julia&apos;s face as she looked
                        forward toward the new life. She walked in a still happiness by August as they went down through
                        Shady Hollow. August had intended to show <pb id="VAA2341-275" n="290"/> her a letter that he
                        had from the mud-clerk, describing the bringing of Humphreys back to Paducah and his execution
                        by a mob. But there was something so repelling in the gusto with which the story was told, and
                        the story was so awful in itself, that he could not bear to interrupt the peaceful happiness of
                        this hour by saying anything about it.</p>
                    <p>August proposed to Julia that they should take a path through the meadow of the river-farmtheir
                        own farm now and see the foundation of the little cottage Andrew had begun for them. And so in
                        happiness they walked on through the meadow-path to the place on which their home was to stand.
                        But, alas! there was not a stick of timber left. Every particle of the material had been
                        removed. It seemed that some great disappointment threatened them at the moment of their
                        happiness. They hurried on in silent foreboding to the castle, but there the mysterywas
                        explained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you not to tempt me too far,&quot; said Andrew. &quot;See I I have
                        concluded to build an addition to the castle and let you civilize me. We will live together and
                        I will reform. This lonely life is not healthy, and now that I have children, why should I not
                        let them live here with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Julia looked happy. I have no authentic information in regard to the exact words which she made
                        use of to express her joy, but from what is known of girls of her age in general, it is safe to
                        infer that she exclaimed, &quot;Oh! I&apos;m so glad!&quot;</p>
                    <p>While Andrew stood there smiling, with Julia near him, August having gone to the assistance of
                        the carpenters in a matter demanding a little more ingenuity than they possessed, Jonas came up
                        and drew the Philosopher aside. Julia could not hoar what was said, but she saw
                        Andrew&apos;sbrow contract.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-276" n="291"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll shoot as sure as they come!&quot; he said with passion. &quot;I
                        won&apos;t have my niece or August insulted in my house by a parcel of vagabonds.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;O Uncle Andrew! is it a shiveree?&quot; asked Julia.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, don&apos;t shoot. It&apos;ll be so funny to have a shiveree.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it is an insult to you and to August and to me. This is meant especially to be an
                        expression of their feeling toward August as a German, though really their envy of his good
                        fortune has much to do with it. It is a second edition of the riot of last spring, in which
                        Gottlieb came so near to being killed. Now, I mean to do my country service by leaving one or
                        two less of them alive if they come here to-night.&quot; For Andrew was full of that
                        destructive energy so characteristic of the &quot;Western and Southern people.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! no, don&apos;t shoot. Can&apos;t you think of some other way?&quot;
                        pleaded Julia.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, yes, I could get the sheriff to come and bag a few of them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And that will make trouble for many years. Let me see. Can&apos;t we do this?
                        &quot;And Julia rapidly unfolded to Andrew and Jonas her plan of operations against the
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Number one!&quot; said Jonas. &quot;They&apos;ll fall into that air
                        amby-scade as sure as shootin&apos;. That plan is military and Christian and civilized and
                        human and angelical and tancycrumptious. It ort to meet the proval of the American Fishhawk with
                        all his pinions and talents. I&apos;ll help to execute it, and beat the rascals or lay my
                        bones a-bleachin&apos; on the desert sands of Shady Holler.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Andrew to Julia, &quot;I knew, if I took you under <pb
                            id="VAA2341-277" n="292"/> my roof, you&apos;d make a Christian of me in spite of
                        myself. And I <hi rend="i">am</hi> a sort of savage, that&apos;s a fact.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jonas hurried home and sent Cynthy over to the castle, and there was much work going on that
                        afternoon. Andrew said that the castle was being made ready for its first siege. As night came
                        on, Julia was in a perfect glee. Reddened by standing over the stove, with sleeves above her
                        elbows and her black hair falling down upon her shoulders, she was such a picture that August
                        stopped and stood in the door a minute to look at her as he came in to supper.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, Jule, how glorious you look!&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve a great
                        mind to fall in love with you, mein Liebchen!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And well she might, for surely, as he stood in the door with his well-knit frame, his German
                        forehead, his pure, reflned mouth, and his clear, honest, amiable blue eyes, he was a man to
                        fall in love with.</p>

                        Language&quot; had not been made wholly in New England, it would not have lacked so many
                        words that do duty as native-born of naturalized citizens in large sections of the United
                        States, and among these words is the one that stands at the head of the present chapter. I know
                        that some disdainful prig will assure me that it is but a corruption of the French <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;charivari&quot;</hi> and so it is; but then <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;charivari&quot;</hi> is a corruption of the low Latin <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;charivarium &quot;and that is a corruption of something else, and indeed,
                            almost every word is a corruption of some other word. So that there is nogood reason why
                            &quot;shiverce&quot; which lives in entire unconsciousness of its French parentage
                            and its Latin grand-parentage should not its place in an &quot;American
                        Dictionary.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>The word, the &quot;shiveree&quot; is mustering at Mandluiffs store. the word, the
                        &quot;shivcrce&quot; is mustering at Mandluff&apos;s store. Bill Day has concluded
                        that he is in no immediate danger of perdition, and that a man is a &quot;blamed fool to git
                        skeered about his soul.&quot; Bob Short is sure the Almighty will not be too hard on a
                        feller, and so thinks he will go on having &quot;a <pb id="VAA2341-279" n="294"/> little
                        fun&quot; now and then. And among the manly recreations which they have proposed to
                        themselves is that of shivereeing &quot;that Dutchman, Gus Wehle.&quot; It is the solemn
                        opinion of the whole crowd that &quot;no Dutchman hadn&apos;t orter be so lucky as to
                        git sech a beauty of a gal and a hundred acres of bottom lands to boot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The members of the party were all disguised, some in one way and some in another, though most of
                        them had their coats inside out. They thought it necessary to be disguised, &quot;bekase,
                        you know,&quot; as Bill Day expressed it, &quot;ole Grizzly is apt to prosecute ef he
                        gits evidence aginyou.&quot; And many were the conjectures as to whether he would shoot or
                        not.</p>
                    <p>The instruments provided by this orchestra were as various as their musical tastes. It is likely
                        that even Mr. Jubilee Gilmore never saw suah as outfit. Bob short had a dumb-bull, a keg with a
                        strip of raw-hide stretched across one end like a drum-head, while the other remained open. A
                        waxed cord inserted in the middle of the drum-head, and reaching down through the keg, completed
                        the instrument. The pulling of the hand over this cord made a hideous bellowing, hence its name.
                        Bill Day had a gigantic watchman&apos;s rattle, a hickory spring on a cog-wheel. It is
                        called in the West a horse-fiddle, because it is so unlike either a horse or a fiddle. Then
                        there were melodious tin pans and conch-shells and tin horns. But the most deadly noise was made
                        by Jim West, who had two iron skillet-lids (&quot;leds&quot; he called them) which, when
                        placedface to face, and rubbed, as you have seen children rub tumblers, made a sound discordant
                        and deafening enough to have suggested Milton&apos;s expression about the hinges which
                        &quot;grated harsh thunder.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-280" n="295"/>
                    <p>One of this party was a tallish man, so dressed as to look like a hunchback, and a hunchback so
                        tall was a most singular figure. He bad joined them in the dark, and the rest were unable to
                        guess who it could be, and he, for his part, would not tell. They thumped him and pushed him,
                        but at each attack he only leaped from the ground like a circus clown, and made his tin horn
                        utter so doleful a complaint as set the party in an uproar of laughter. They could not be sure
                        who he was, but he was a funny fellow to have along with them at any rate.</p>
                    <p>He was not only funny, but he was evidently fearless. For when they came to the castle it was all
                        dark and still. Bill Day said that it looked &quot;powerful juberous to him. Olc Andy
                        meantto use shootin&apos;-ir&apos;ns, and didn&apos;t want to be pestered with no
                        lights blazin&apos; in his eyes.&quot; Butthe tall hunchback cleared the fence at a
                        bound, and told them to come on &quot;ef they had the sperrit of a two-weeks-old goslin into
                        &apos;cm.&quot; So the bottle was passed round, and for very shame they followed their
                        ungainly leader.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Looky here, boys,&quot; said the hunchback, &quot;they&apos;s one way that
                        we can fix it so&apos;s ole Grizzly can&apos;t shoot. They&apos;s a little
                        shop-place, a sort of a shed, agin the house, on the side next to the branch. Let&apos;s git
                        in thar afore we begin, and he can&apos;t about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The orchestra were a little stupefied with drink, and they took the idea quickly, never stopping
                        to ask how they could retreat if Andrew chose to shoot. Jim &quot;West thought things
                        lookedscaly, but he warn&apos;t agoin&apos; to backslide arter he&apos;d got so fur.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When they got into Andrew&apos;s shop, where he had a new <pb id="VAA2341-281"
                            n="296"/> and beautiful skiff in building, the tall hunchback shut the door, and the rest
                        did not noticethat he put the key in his pocket.</p>
                    <p>That serenade! Such a medley of discordant sounds, such a clatter and clangor, such a rattle of
                        horse-fiddle, such a bellowing of dumb-bull, such a snorting of tin horns, such a ringing of tin
                        pans, such a grinding of skillet-lids! But the house remained quiet. Once Bill Day thought that
                        he heard a laugh within. Julia may have lost her self-control. She was so happy, and a little
                        unrestrained fun was so strange a luxury!</p>
                    <p>At last the floor between the house and shop was suddenly opened, and Julia, radiant as she could
                        be, stood on the threshold with a candle in her hand.</p>
                    <p>But the gentlemen essayed to go out.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Locked in, by thunder!&quot; said Jim West, trying the outside door of the shop.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We heard you were coming, gentlemen, and provided a little entertainment. Come
                        in!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come in, boys,&quot; said the hunchback, &quot;don&apos;t be afeard of
                        nobody.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mechanically they followed the hunchback into the room, for there was nothing else to be done. A
                        smell of hot coffee and the sight of a well-spread table greeted their senses.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welcome, my friends, thrice welcome!&quot; said Andrew.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put down your instruments and have some supper.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me relieve you,&quot; said Julia, and she took the dumbbull from Bob Short and
                        the &quot;horse-fiddle&quot; from Day, the tin horns and tin pans from others, and the
                        two skillet-lids from Jim West, who looked as sheepish as possible. August escorted each of them
                        to the table, though his face did not look <pb id="VAA2341-282" n="297"/> altogether cordial.
                        Some old resentment for the treatment of his father interfered with the heartiness of his
                        hospitality. The hunchback in this light proved to be Jonas, of course; and Bill Day whispered
                        to the one next to him that they had been &quot;tuck in and done fer that time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gentlement,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;we are much obliged for your
                        music.&quot; And Cynthy would certainlyhave laughed out if she had not been so perplexed in
                        her mind to know whether Andrew was speaking the truth.</p>
                    <p>Such a motley set of wedding guests as they were, with their coats inside out and their other
                        disguises! Such a race of pied pipers! And looking at their hangdog faces you would Have said,
                        &quot;Such a lot of sheep-thieves!&quot; though way a sheep-thief is considered to be a
                        more guilty-looking man than any other criminal, I do not know. Jonas looked bright enough and
                        ridiculous enough with his hunch. They all ate rather heartily, for how could they resist the
                        attentions of Cynthy Ann and the persuasions of Julla, who poured them coffee and handed them
                        biscuit, and waited upon them as though they were royal guests! And, moreover, the act of eating
                        served to cover their confusion.</p>
                    <p>As the meal drew to a close, Bill Day felt that he, being in some sense the leader of the party,
                        ought to speak. He was not quite sober, though he could stand without much staggering. He had
                        been trying for some time to frame a little speech, but his faculties did not work smoothly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. PresidentI mean Mr. Andersonpermit me to offer you our pardon. I mean to beg your
                        apologiestoahemhope that ourthat yourourthousanthanksyouryou know what I mean.&quot; And he
                        sat down in foolish confusion.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2341-283" n="298"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh! yes. All right; much obliged, my friend,&quot; said the Philosopher, who had
                        not felt so much boyish animal life in twenty-five years.</p>
                    <p>And Jim West whispered to Bill: &quot;You expressed my sentiments exactly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Anderson,&quot; said Jonas, rising, and thus lifting up his hunched shoulders
                        and looking the picture of a long-legged heron standing in the water, &quot;Mr. Anderson,
                        you and our young and happy friend, Mr. Wehle, will accept our thanks. &quot;We thought that
                        music was all you wanted to gin a delightfulkindersorterwell, top-dressin&apos;, to this
                        interestin&apos; occasion. Now they&apos;s nothin&apos; sweeter&apos;n a tin
                        horn, &apos;thout &apos;tis a <hi rend="i">melodious</hi> conch-shell utterin&apos;
                        its voice like a turkle-dove. Then we&apos;ve got the paytent double whirlymagig
                        hoss-violeen, and the tin pannyforte, and, better nor all, the grindin&apos; skelletled
                        cymbals. We&apos;ve laid ourselves out and done our purtiest hain&apos;t we,
                        feller-musicians?to prove that we was the best band on the Ohio River. An&apos; all out of

                        Hain&apos;t we?&quot; (Here they all nodded assent, though they looked as though they
                        wished themselves far enough.) &quot;Our enstruments is a leetle out of toon, owin&apos;
                        to the dampness of the night air, and so I trust you&apos;ll excuse us playin&apos; a
                        farowell piece.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jim West was so anxious to get away that ho took advantage of this turn to say good-evening, and
                        though the mischievous Julia insisted that ho should select his instrument, he had not the face
                        to confess to the skillet-lids, and got out of it by assuring her that he hadn&apos;t
                        brought nothing, &quot;only come along to see the fun.&quot; And each member of the
                        party repeated <pb id="VAA2341-284" n="299"/> the transparent lie, so that Julia found herself
                        supplied with more musical instrumentsthan any young housekeeper need want, and Andrew hung
                        them, horns, pans, conch-shell, dumb-bull, horse-fiddle, skillet-lids, and all, in his library,
                        as trophies captured from the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Much as I should like to tell you of the later events of the Philosopher&apos;s life, and
                        about Julia and August, and their oldest son, whose name is Andrew, and all that, I do not know
                        that I can do better than to bow myself out with the abashed serenaders, letting this musical
