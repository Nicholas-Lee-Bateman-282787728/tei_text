                        before her father. Two reasons. Nobody but her to keep the old man out of
                        the workhouse—and “father is so proud.” If she died first, he would starve;
                        worst of all he might hear what had happened up in London to his girl.</p>

                    The Curtain rises on an uproar. The crowd, which momentarily increases, is
                    composed chiefly of weedy youths and wastrel old men. There are a few decent
                    artisans; three or four “beery” out‐o’‐works; three or four young women of the
                    domestic servant or Strand restaurant cashier class; one aged woman in rusty
                    black peering with faded, wondering eyes, consulting the faces of the men and
                    laughing nervously and apologetically from time to time; one or two
                    quiet‐looking, business‐like women, thirty to forty; two middle‐class men, who
                    stare and whisper and smile. A quiet old man with a lot of unsold Sunday papers
                    under one arm stands in an attitude of rapt attention, with the free hand round
                    his deaf ear. A brisk‐looking woman of forty‐five or so, wearing pince‐nez, goes
                    round with a pile of propagandist literature on her arm. Many of the men smoking
                    cigarettes—the old ones pipes. On the outskirts of this crowd, of several
                    hundred, a couple of smart men in tall shining hats hover a few moments, single
                    eyeglasses up, and then saunter off. Against the middle of the Column, where it
                    rises above the stone platform, is a great red banner, one supporting pole
                    upheld by a grimy<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7192-051"/> sandwichman, the other by a
                    small, dirty boy of eight. If practicable only the lower portion of the banner
                    need be seen, bearing the final words of the legend—“VOTES FOR WOMEN!” in
                    immense white letters. It will be well to get, to the full, the effect of the
                    height above the crowd of the straggling group of speakers on the pedestal
                    platform. These are, as the Curtain rises, a working‐class woman who is waving
                    her arms and talking very earnestly, her voice for the moment blurred in the
                    uproar. She is dressed in brown serge and looks pinched and sallow. At her side
                    is the CHAIRMAN urging that she be given a fair hearing. ALLEN TRENT is a tall,
                    slim, brown‐haired man of twenty‐eight, with a slight stoop, an agreeable
                    aspect, well‐bred voice, and the gleaming brown eye of the visionary. Behind
                    these two, looking on or talking among themselves, are several other carelessly
                    dressed women; one, better turned out than the rest, is quite young, very slight
                    and gracefully built, with round, very pink cheeks, full, scarlet lips,
                    naturally waving brown hair, and an air of childish gravity. She looks at the
                    unruly mob with imperturbable calm. The CHAIRMAN’s voice is drowned.)</stage>

                        women. And it’s true. We <emph>are</emph> sensitive. But I tell you,
                        ridicule crumples a man up. It steels a woman. We’ve come to know the value

                        has ever said it was unfeminine for women to do the heavy drudgery that’s
                        badly paid. That kind of work had to be done by <emph>some</emph>body—and

                        But if they want to try their hand at the better paid work of the liberal
                        professions—oh, very unfeminine indeed! Then there’s another thing. Now I
                        want you to listen to this, because it’s <emph>very&gt;</emph> important.
                        Men say if we persist in competing with them for the bigger prizes, they’re
                        dreadfully afraid we’d lose the beautiful protesting chivalry that—Yes, I
                        don’t wonder you laugh. <emph>We</emph> laugh. <stage type="mix">(Bending

                        Works working for five shillings a week—I didn’t see them laughing. The
                        beautiful chivalry of the employers of women doesn’t prevent them from
                        paying women tenpence a day for sorting coal and loading and unloading
                        carts—doesn’t prevent them from forcing women to earn bread in ways worse
                        still. So we won’t talk about chivalry. It’s being over‐;sarcastic. We’ll
                        just let this poor ghost of chivalry go—in exchange for a little plain
                        justice.</p>

                        eleven. Well, I took a great deal of trouble, and I didn’t believe what I
                        was told— <stage type="mix">(Warming a little to her task.)</stage> Yes,
                        that’s almost the first thing we have to learn—to get over our touching
                        faith that, because a man tells us something, it’s true. I got to the right
                        court, and I was so anxious not to be late, I was too early. The case before
                        the Women’s was just coming on. I heard a noise. At the door I saw the
                        helmets of two policemen, and I said to myself: “What sort of crime shall I
                        have to sit and hear about? Is this a burglar coming along between the two
                        big policemen, or will it be a murderer? What sort of felon is to stand in
                        the dock before the women whose crime is they ask for the vote?” But, try as
                        I would, I couldn’t see the prisoner. My heart misgave me. Is it a woman, I
                        wondered? Then the policemen got nearer, and I saw—<stage type="mix">(she

                        think he was charged with? Stealing. What had he been stealing—that small

                        the men who had the affairs of the world in their hands from the beginning,

                        before the London County Council. They looked into the question “very

                        of it in my world. A few months ago I should have turned away my eyes and
                        forgotten even the headline as quickly as I could. But since that morning in
                        the police‐court, I read these things. This, as you’ll remember, was about a
                        little working girl—an orphan of eighteen—who crawled with the dead<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7192-078"/> body of her new‐born child to her master’s
                        back‐door, and left the baby there. She dragged herself a little way off and
                        fainted. A few days later she found herself in court, being tried for the
                        murder of her child. Her master—a married man—had of course reported the
                        “find” at his back‐door to the police, and he had been summoned to give
                        evidence. The girl cried out to him in the open court, “You are the father!”
                        He couldn’t deny it. The Coroner at the jury’s request censured the man, and
                        regretted that the law didn’t make him responsible. But he went scot‐free.
                        And that girl is now serving her sentence in Strangeways Gaol.</p>

                        sufficient. And now you come between him and a younger woman—just to play
                        Nemesis, so far as I can make out!</p>

                    <p>Geoffrey Stonor! For me he’s simply one of the far‐back links in a chain of

                        unhappiness, to once that I remember that old unhappiness of mine that’s
                        past. I think of the nail and chain makers of Cradley Heath. The sweated
                        girls of the slums. I think of the army of ill‐used women whose very
                        existence I mustn’t mention—</p>

                    <p>I came here, under considerable pressure, to speak of the future—not to

                    <p>I know. And it’s not fair. Men suffer as well as we by the woman’s starting
                        wrong. We are taught to think the man a sort of demigod. If he tells her:
                        “go down into Hell”—down into Hell she goes.</p>

                    <p>Yes, they go down together, but the man comes up alone. As a rule. It is more
                        convenient so—for him. And for the Other Woman.</p>

                        say, “What general significance has my secret pain? Does it ‘join on’ to
                        anything?” And I find it does. I’m no longer merely a woman who has stumbled
                        on the way. I’m one <stage type="mix">(she controls with difficulty the

                        moved out of other women’s way.” And she calls people to come and help. No
                        mortal man, let alone a woman, <emph>by herself</emph>, can move that rock
                        of offence. But <stage type="mix">(with a sudden sombre flame of
