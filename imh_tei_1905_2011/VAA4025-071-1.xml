            <p>Controversies over banking provided much of the fuel for the political fires that raged during the
                    Age of Jackson. Bank wars occurred on national, state, and local levels throughout the era. These
                    struggles often reached heroic proportions, especially in the West after the Panic of 1837 when hard
                    money Democrats mounted strong, steady, and often successful attacks against existing banking
                    institutions and practices.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    antibank activity. At first glance the local bank war in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> shows a familiar Whig-Democrat struggle, with Democrats linking their opponents to an

                    with the inflated rhetoric common to antebellum America, Jacksonian attacks on the institution and
                    on the political and business aristocracy associated with it did contain elements of truth. Unlike

                    serious consideration of a state banking system. The lawmakers adjourned without agreeing on a bank
                    bill but in the next session again took up the issue. In January, 1834, the legislature passed and
                    the governor signed an act establishing the Second State Bank of Indiana.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The
                    charter gave exclusive banking privileges to the new State Bank and, to add to the
                    institution's public character, stipulated that the state was to own one half the
                    bank's capital stock. The new institution, as it was organized, consisted of ten branch
                    banks, each with separate officers and directors, and a central State Bank Board. The State Bank
                    Board was composed of the president of the State Bank, four persons appointed by the legislature,
                    and one delegate from each of the ten branches. The board's primary responsibility was to
                    conduct periodic examinations of the branches to insure compliance with charter provisions. The
                    officers of the State Bank, who carried out most of the board's responsibilities, were the
                    president, Samuel Merrill, and the cashier, James M. Ray. Both were prominent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> businessmen. In addition to the control exercised by the State Bank Board and officers,
                    the branch banks were also bound together by provisions for mutual liability whereby all were liable
                    for the debts of any branch that failed. In actual operation the ten branch banks enjoyed a large
                    degree of independence. Each branch retained its profits and had its own stockholders who elected
                    the majority of the branch directors. (The State Bank Board elected three of a total of between ten
                    and thirteen branch directors.) The directors chose the branch's officers and were
                    responsible for managing the branch. Branch directors or officers decided, for example, who would
                    receive loans and the kind and amount of security to require.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

                    </placeName> merchants had extended large credits to their customers and, in turn, had received

                    conditions in early 1837, however, seaboard wholesalers were less willing to grant new credit and
                    were presenting notes for payment as soon as they came due. Had <placeName>

                    been unable to pay the debts they owed the Branch Bank. By mid-May economic crisis seemed imminent.
                    Six of the town's leading merchants decided to meet and "consult as to the general

            <p>The desire of merchants not to slight the Branch Bank in payment of their debts and their attempt to
                    keep the currency circulating at par illustrate their dependence upon the bank. Without the

                    least would have been required to reduce their scale of operations. With a currency that circulated
                    below par they would have been forced to pay close attention to changing discount rates and to risk
                    losing profits by accepting a note at more than its value or gain the ire of their customers by
                    demanding too high a discount. In their collective and public support of the Branch Bank during the

                    But the economic crisis continued during the summer and fall of 1837, and as eastern creditors

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> merchants and other residents became convinced that "hard times" had
                        arrived.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> In the midst of this economic difficulty the attack on the State
                    Bank of Indiana began.</p>
            <p>Criticism leveled against the State Bank in late 1837 and early 1838 was based in part on the
                    traditional hard money agrarianism that distrusted all banks, especially after the suspension of
                    specie payment.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The most significant attacks, however, centered not on hard
                    money arguments but on issues of economic and political discrimination. The political charge was
                    straightforward; the State Bank and particularly the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch was a Whig institution. In 1837 eleven of the twelve officers and directors of
                    the branch were said to be Whigs.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Because Democrats were understandably more
                    willing to find fault with an institution controlled by their political opponents, any charge made
                    against the bank was a potential issue for public debate. The charge of economic discrimination
                    centered on the issue of who received and who was denied Branch Bank credit. One Democratic editor
                    summarized the criticisms of both Whigs and Democrats when he asserted: "The heavy
                    merchant, land speculator and bank director are generally accommodated by the bank with as much as

                    questioned about the basis for deciding which notes and bills to discount, the cashier of the
                    branch, Bethuel F. Morris, refused to answer.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The cashier of the State Bank
                    and friend of many branch directors, James M. Ray, privately dismissed these charges by the House
                    committee as part of "the effort to rebuild on the prejudices against Banks, and against
                    those whose industry &amp; talent have been blessed with success in the world.

            <p>The charges against the State Bank had little immediate effect. Public discontent with the
                    institution declined, and the legislature took no action on the House committee report of January,
                    1838, in part because of the return of apparent prosperity and the resumption of specie payment in
                    August, 1838.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> State Bank President Samuel Merrill noted in early 1839:
                    "Last year the very dogs seemed to bark at all concerned in the Bank but this year we are
                    almost too popular."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Merrill's optimism proved to be short
                    lived. The attack on the State Bank during 1837 and 1838 was only a preparatory skirmish, and the
                    quiet period of late 1838 and early 1839 was but a lull prior to full scale conflict.</p>
            <p>The renewed and more vigorous attack on the State Bank grew out of political and economic events of
                    late 1839 and 1840. The election of 1839 produced a Democratic majority in the Indiana House,
                    thereby stimulating visions of greater state—and perhaps also
                    Democratic—control of the bank.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Indiana Jacksonians were also
                    looking to the election of 1840 and welcomed any hint of bank corruption or mismanagement that they
                    could blame on Whig directors and officers. In addition to partisan politics the bank war was fought
                    against the background of severe economic depression, <list type="footnotes">

                    bankers and merchants.</p>
            <p>The skirmishes of 1837 and 1838 had only hinted at the indebtedness of merchants to the Branch Bank.
                    In 1840, near the low point of the economic depression, critics pushed this issue into public view.
                    A committee appointed by the Democratically controlled House of Representatives investigated the
                    State Bank and reported in January, 1840, that in making loans, officers and directors of several
                    branches had shown "extreme partiality to merchants over farmers. …"<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Part of the evidence for the committee's conclusion came from
                    Morris, cashier of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch. On the evening of January 9, 1840, Morris appeared before the investigators to
                    respond to their "interrogatories." He informed the committee that loans due the
                    branch from individual debtors amounted to over $400,000 and that almost
                    $225,000 of this sum had been loaned to merchants. Large merchant debts indicated, Morris
                    admitted, that "but a small portion of the community are directly accommodated with loans,
                    yet," he added, "the <hi rend="i">indirect</hi> accommodations of the bank are
                    very generally distributed among the people. …" Referring to the credit extended
                    to customers by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> businessmen, the cashier asserted that "an inquiry recently made"
                    showed that there was then "due to the merchants, mechanics and manufacturers of the town
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    dollars, and almost exclusively from the farmers." Without "bank
                    accommodations," he concluded, "the merchants and others in the town could not
                    permit [this credit] to remain in the hands of their customers. …"<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The <placeName>

                    persons were indebted to one <placeName>

            <p>The investigating committee agreed that farmers received credit through merchants. Unlike Morris,
                    however, the committee did not approve of this arrangement but favored instead direct loans to
                    farmers to encourage agricultural production and to increase the shipment of surplus farm products.
                    Lending money to merchants instead of farmers, the committee argued, had enabled the businessmen to
                    purchase large quantities of goods, most of which were "articles of show and luxury, beyond
                    the wants and the ability of the community." The committee concluded that the result had
                    been "to stimulate a love of indulgence and display, and to increase the consumption of the
                    country beyond its production. The State therefore is impoverished, [and] the habits of the people
                    vitiated, by the policy of stimulating the import trade … by bank credit."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to criticizing large loans to merchants the committee of 1840 also renewed earlier
                    charges of discrimination in favor of Branch Bank officers, directors, and stockholders.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The Democratic <hi rend="i">Indiana State Sentinel</hi> repeated the
                    criticism and noted: "very few, if any of the <hi rend="i">common people</hi>, the farmers
                    and mechanics, can get a discount; yet it is well known that bankrupts … and particular
                    favorites, can get almost any amount called for. …"<hi rend="sup">37</hi> These

            <p>Early in 1842 the legislature appointed Nathan B. Palmer to conduct an extensive examination of the
                    State Bank. Palmer was a Democrat, but his report contained little of the hard money, antibank
                    philosophy often associated with western Jacksonianism. His criticisms were instead directed to
                    specific instances of mismanagement, most importantly the practice of "granting large

                    included a list of these unpaid notes which were under protest. Most debtors on the list owed sums
                    of only a few hundred dollars, but three persons stand out as owing large amounts: James Blake owed
                    $13,400; Samuel Henderson, $10,000; and Daniel Yandes, $7,236. All

                    a subject of conversation for several years, and the names that had been heard in the streets were
                    those of McCarty, Blake, Yandes, Henderson, and others of the town's leading

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Indiana Democrat</hi> illustrates the tactics used. Referring to businessmen in general
                    and to merchants in particular, the writer asserted: "the nature of their business is such
                    that <hi rend="i">selfishness</hi> and self interest become their leading incentives to
                    action," and "they lose to a great extent the feeling of expansive philanthropy
                    which look[s] to the interests of all." With proper Jacksonian rhetoric the editor
                    concluded: "constant hankering after <hi rend="i">profits</hi> has an evil influence upon
                    the mind. This class of men opposed Jefferson, they opposed Jackson, they now oppose Mr. Van Buren.
                    They never did as a body, belong to the democracy. Taught from early life to look upon <hi rend="i">wealth</hi> and <hi rend="i">goodness</hi> as the same thing, they will of course unite with
                    the aristocracy."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Businessmen were dangerous not only because they

                    </placeName> Jacksonian, they were "in possession of the two great elements of power,

                    created a Whig business community powerful enough to carry out its own measures of self interest and

                    exactly how the alleged clique of businessmen operated. An editor could deplore "the

                    making evident economic and political favoritism on the part of a public institution, Democratic
                    criticism prepared the way for a movement to change Branch Bank practices. Unlike the experience of
                    some other states, however, Indiana Jacksonians did not participate directly in formulating or
                    instituting these changes. Instead, members of the <placeName>

               </placeName>, but because of an abundance of
                    lawyers there decided in 1821 to move to the future capital of Indiana. Fletcher was the first

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and practiced law there for several years. With the aid of his friend McCarty he became
                    a collection agent for many eastern merchants, and by the early 1830s debt collection was the
                    largest and most profitable part of his business. But Fletcher soon acquired other interests and
                    gradually diminished his law and collection activities, turning much of this work over to partners.
                    He served in the Indiana Senate from 1826 to 1833. In the mid-1830s he spent much of his time and
                    money on investment projects, including the Washington Hall Hotel, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Insurance Company, the Branch Bank, and large land speculations with McCarty. The hard
                    times of the late 1830s and early 1840s left Fletcher with large debts, including some to the Branch
                    Bank. At the same time, however, his collection business prospered, and unlike many other debtors
                    Fletcher was soon able to meet most of his obligations. By 1842 he possessed enough financial
                    security to abandon law and debt collection, and from then until his death in 1866 much of his
                    attention was devoted to banking. During the 1830s Fletcher had been a member of the State Bank
                    Board and the attorney for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch. His interest in the issue of loans to branch favorites brought about a closer
                    association with the institution.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fletcher's concern over Branch Bank credit antedated the Panic of 1837. In early March,
                    1837, he noted: "Several of our Merchants are going East &amp; have been accommodated
                    to an extravigant [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] length at [the] Bank." He added: "it has
                    been resolved by several of us that we will put a stop to such extravigant [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                        <hi rend="i">loans.</hi>"<hi rend="sup">63</hi> But Fletcher and his unidentified
                    associates apparently took no action at this time, and the intensive Branch Bank reform movement did
                    not begin until 1840.</p>

            <p>In late 1839 Stoughton Fletcher, Calvin's youngest brother, was elected to a directorship in
                    the Branch Bank. Stoughton had arrived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1831 and had soon become a successful merchant and later a broker and banker.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Encouraged by Calvin, Stoughton began in early 1840 to vote against
                    extensions and further renewals of loans to directors and other favorites.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
                    Though urged by his brother to persevere, Stoughton soon abandoned bank reform. In early October,
                    1840, the two brothers had a conversation that marked the beginning of an estrangement between them.
                    "He insists," Calvin lamented, "on getting very rich &amp; thinks I
                    am too scrupulous on the subject of buying notes. …"<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friction between two brothers was only a small part of the conflict caused within the <placeName>

                    </placeName> business community by the issue of Branch Bank reform. Calvin Fletcher made his first
                    substantial move toward reform in mid-1840, when, in his position as a member of the State Bank
                    Board, he obtained the appointment of Ovid Butler and Corson Vickers as Branch Bank directors.
                    Butler was Calvin Fletcher's partner in the collection agency, and Vickers was a successful
                    businessman interested in several enterprises, including merchandising. Both were sympathetic to
                    Calvin Fletcher, who stated that the purpose in their appointment was "to check the
                    merchants influence in the Branch" and to end large loans to merchants, directors, and
                        stockholders.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Other directors viewed their two new colleagues with
                    disapproval and fear.<hi rend="sup">68</hi> As for himself, Calvin Fletcher noted: the attempt at
                    "reform has brought me into bad odor with some of my best friends." McCarty
                    especially was "so injured in his feelings that he does not wish to see me on the
                        Subject."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Appointment of two new directors did not immediately change Branch Bank practices. In late August,
                    1840, the branch approved large discounts for merchants "to go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> for goods." Calvin Fletcher was dismayed. "It must be
                    stopped," he vowed.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>

            <p>After planning his strategy, Calvin Fletcher met on December 15 with Alexander Worth and Samuel
                    Herriott. Both had been branch directors since 1834. Fletcher gained their support for an attempt to
                    replace as directors his wayward brother, Stoughton, and McCarty's representative,
                    Williams. On the same day and with the support of Worth, Herriott, Butler, and Vickers, Calvin
                    Fletcher attended "a meeting of old friends," held in Alfred Harrison's
                    dry goods store. The informal gathering had been "very prudently called" by Ray,
                    cashier of the State Bank and a large stockholder in the Branch Bank.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>
                    According to Fletcher, Ray was, throughout the reform campaign, the "promoter of
                    peace" and the intermediary between the reformers and the people they alienated.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> His pacificatory talents were especially needed at the December 15 meeting.
                    In attendance were Benjamin I. Blythe, A. W. Russell, Bates, Blake, Harrison, McCarty, Ray, and
                    Fletcher, all leaders of the business community and all debtors to the Branch Bank.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> They argued long over the question of discounts to merchants, and while there was
                    considerable disagreement, a majority eventually conceded the necessity of reducing loans. Calvin
                    Fletcher also presented his proposal not to reelect his brother and Williams. This, too, generated
                    "much heat," but most of those present eventually consented.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the meeting of December 15 was a major victory for the reformers, they continued their fight
                    for several years, gradually effecting measures that substantially reduced criticism of the Branch
                    Bank. In late December, 1840, <placeName>

                    effect, although the achieved reduction was undoubtedly due largely to the depressed nature of the
                        economy.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> In a direct attempt to mollify political discontent with the
                    Branch Bank the reformers gradually succeeded in replacing old directors with new ones, some of whom
                    were Democrats and none of whom was a large debtor.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> The old officers were also
                    forced out. Bates had been president of the branch since its organization, but the reformers
                    considered him too willing to extend credit. In early 1844 they met, again informally at
                    Harrison's store, and decided "they would invite H. Bates to resign the
                    Presidency. …"<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Bates accepted the invitation, and the
                    reformers succeeded in getting Calvin Fletcher elected in his place. Later they also replaced Morris

            <p>By the mid-1840s Fletcher and his associates had completed their reforms. They had corrected the
                    major abuses of personal favoritism by setting and obtaining agreement to loan repayment schedules
                    for long standing debtors and by curtailing new loans to merchants and bank directors. And they had
                    reduced partisan discrimination by adding Democrats to the bank's board of directors.</p>
            <p>In carrying out these measures the reformers stole much of the Jacksonians' thunder and
                    perhaps prevented more far reaching changes. Democratic criticism of the Branch Bank had been
                    sufficiently strong and valid in the early 1840s to threaten drastic changes in the institution and
                    perhaps even the entire state banking system. Such indeed was the result of Jacksonian attacks in
                    many other western states where the failure of reform efforts contributed ultimately to successful
                    movements to abolish banks. That Indiana was spared drastic measures in the early 1840s was
                    doubtless the result of many factors, most notably the strength of the Indiana Whig party, the
                    weakness of hard money sentiment <list type="footnotes">

                    community was subject to the kind of vituperative criticism that plagued them in the late 1830s and
                    early 1840s. The Democratic press in these later years was nearly silent on such subjects as large
                    loans to bank favorites and the alleged Junto of businessmen using the bank for selfish purposes.

                        <p>The state of our church in the West is such that it requires missionaries. Those missionaries
                            ought to be appointed to labor in certain spheres where there is prospect of doing good, and
                            be stationed there for at least one year or more at a time, until it could be ascertained if
                            congregations could be formed. It is found that missionaries, sent out merely to explore the
                            country and to make reports, do but little or no good at all to the church. They only raise
                            the expectations of our dispersed people, scattered as they are throughout the wilderness,
                            and then disappoint them. The consequence of this is that they despair of ever getting a
                            minister of our church to live among them. The tendency of this is to excite prejudice in

                    the Old Northwest were for the most part traveling missionaries. And they were few in number. The
                    tardiness of Lutheran efforts in the West was due not so much to lack of willingness or of concern
                    for the spiritual well being of the dispersed brethren but to the small number of Lutherans in the

            <p>Other considerations also retarded Lutheran efforts in the western areas. The use of German in
                    synodical meetings and worship services created a language barrier and, allied with the tendency of
                    many Lutherans to isolate themselves in their own communities, also alienated a nativist element on
                    the frontier which condemned such denominations as Lutheran and Catholic as immigrant or
                    "foreign" churches. Like other confessional churches, Lutherans relied on an
                    educated clergy, were less effusive in their beliefs and worship services than many of the early
                    Baptists and Methodists, and were therefore somewhat "out of place" on the

            <p>In addition, synodical feuding and competitiveness complicated progress in the West. With some

                    exclusive adherence to the doctrines and official documents of the sixteenth century without

                    opinion on some confessional and practical matters, advocated adjustment to American customs and the
                    English language, and wanted to cooperate with all Lutherans for the purposes of work and

                    followed much the same route as did Heyer. His six letters, possibly also written to Schmucker who

                    1837. Although both missionaries experienced similar hardships on the frontier and encountered
                    similar problems among the Lutheran communities, Keller's youthful intensity provides an
                    interesting contrast to Heyer's experience and maturity. Keller concluded his tour near the

            </p>
            <p>Heyer's and Keller's letters are particularly valuable because they bring to light

                    </placeName>. They describe the location of the various Lutheran settlements and provide some
                    information as to the background and points of origin of the settlers. The letters also tell of the
                    traveling missionaries' contacts with clergy and laity of other denominations and give
                    interesting and perhaps exaggerated accounts of the moral and spiritual laxity of the frontier. The
                    writers point to rivalries between the Indiana Synod and the Synod of the West, both of which were
                    founded in 1835 and both of which operated in the Indiana area.</p>
            <p>The two missionaries' letters also reveal the early Lutherans' reluctance to
                    becoming too Americanized. Although they were loyal citizens of the state of Indiana and of the
                    republic, Lutherans frequently isolated themselves in small communities, and Lutheranism in the <placeName>

            <p>Other prominent religious and intellectual historians have also noted that midwestern Lutheranism in
                    particular may early have avoided coming to grips with the social issues of American life. This
                    "turning away," they suggest, may first have occurred in the midnineteenth century
                    and may have continued thereafter in varying degrees. Vergelius Ferm concluded that this crisis in
                    Lutheran theology probably occurred around 1855, and Martin Marty and Sydney Ahlstrom have
                    elaborated on the same theme.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The twelve Heyer and Keller letters which are
                    reproduced below signal that the crisis was already underway by 1835, and the two missionaries
                    anticipate the difficulties which the Lutheran church would encounter in confronting American
                    society. In a way, the letters also provide a possible explanation for—or at least a
                    basis for understanding—the Lutherans' personal beliefs and theological
                    schizophrenia, topics which were treated by Sidney Mead in two separate addresses in 1973.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    a group of German families so strenuously Lutheran "that they positively declare they

                    He concluded revealingly: "nor would they be persuaded otherwise." And in his
                    report of May 28, 1836, Heyer wrote: "Many of the Lutherans in Indiana State have emigrated
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

                    Synod. On various occasions I have conversed with these people, and pointed out to them wherein they
                    misapprehended things." His expressed hope for a union between the Indiana Synod and the
                    Synod of the West, however, did not materialize.</p>
            <p>Keller also expressed the need for a closer union among Lutherans in the West. In his initial letter
                    he commented: "It is to be regretted that those men, who have charge of the German
                    Congregations, cannot preach in the English language; if they could, they might whilst they are
                    tending to and supported by the Germans, also gradually raise English congregations."
                    Keller was even more distressed by the fact that the Lutheran church was not well known or well
                    accepted in many frontier areas. About northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> he wrote: "So shamefully ignorant are Christians in this part of the country
                    that <hi rend="i">some</hi> do not know that the Lutheran is the <hi rend="i">oldest</hi> Protestant
                    Church in existence; and others think that the Lutheran and Catholic Churches are the <hi rend="i">same."</hi> Many individuals thought him "a <hi rend="i">catholic
                    priest</hi>, or a <hi rend="i">Cambelite</hi> or a former of a new sect."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Perhaps most revealing are the young missionary's statements regarding the type of
                    Lutheran minister which was needed on the frontier. Keller concluded his enumeration of necessary
                    qualifications: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Let no one entertain the opinion that the weaker instruments should be sent to the West. This
                            erroneous notion has been too prevalent in the ecclesiastical bodies of the East. If there
                            be talent, learning and eloquence necessary in any part of the land, it is West of the
                            Alleghany and in no place are eminent ministerial qualifications so much appreciated and so
                            highly estimated as in this. In most places … a Lutheran minister should be able
                            to preach in both languages, to endure privations, to suffer hardships and to labor with
                            patience amidst many discouragements.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">30</hi> The term "Cambelite" probably refers to a follower of
                        Alexander and Thomas Campbell, leaders of a movement in the early 1800s to discard all human
                        creeds and return to the Bible as the sole source of authority in religion. This movement
                        eventually led to the formation of the Christian church (Disciples of Christ). Heyer, too, found
                        a lack of knowledge of Lutheranism on the frontier. In his letter of March 28, 1836, he wrote:

                                            missionaries, its chief accomplishment was the missionary journey undertaken
                                            by Heyer. Because the Central Missionary Society failed to gain the support
                                            of all of the various Lutheran synods, its work ceased within a few years.

                                            nineteenth century were itinerant ministers who posed as bona fide pastors
                                            but who were "wolves in sheep's clothing." In his

                                    ministry. This is what br. Rizer desires, and I would therefore recommend him to the
                                    Central Missionary Society, to engage his services. After leaving some appointments
                                    with br. R. for the first and second Sunday in June next, to be sent to Corydon,
                                    Harrison co. Ind., I proceeded mostly on by-roads, to shun the mud, and through
                                    thinly settled parts of Indiana, to the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, where I
                                    arrived on Saturday evening, Jan. 23.</p>
                        <p>As far as my information goes, with respect to the state of Indiana, there are German
                                    settlements in the following counties:—<placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Jefferson</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Scott</settlement>,

                                    </placeName>. How strong these settlements are, I could not yet ascertain, but some
                                    of them I expect to visit next spring when I shall be able to learn the particulars.
                                    I am satisfied that there is much work to be done in Indiana, but when, how, and by
                                    whom it is done, these are questions which I shall be better able to answer, after
                                    exploring the state more extensively than I have yet had time to do. On Sunday, Jan.
                                    24th, I preached to the Germans in <geogName>Mount Carmel</geogName>, <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                                    </placeName>. The number of German families in this place amount to about 25, mostly
                                    Europeans. I was introduced to, and kindly entertained by the Rev. T. S. Hinde, who
                                    has manifested his desire that the German population in the far west should be
                                    provided with suitable ministers of the gospel.</p>
                        <p>On Monday, Jan. 25th, I visited a German settlement about 12 miles from
                                        <geogName>Mount Carmel</geogName>, appointed preaching for Wednesday. The number
                                    of persons present yesterday, amounted to about one hundred. I have baptized eleven
                                    children since Sunday. I am now on my way to visit other German settlements about
                                    eight and ten miles distant,—and I have made appointments for Saturday,
                                    Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. After attending to these

                                    and select all wood land, or take one half prairie, and the other half timber. The
                                    latter I should think preferable, for in this case a man has nothing to do but to

                                    are scattered, and it will take time and labor to collect and unite them as they
                                    ought to be. The congregations have suffered from various causes. At different times
                                    they were imposed on by men who professed to be German ministers, but who did not
                                    walk worthy of their high vocation. There was also a season when a preaching spirit
                                    possessed some of the members of the church, without succeeding in the attempt; the
                                    Methodists, Baptists, Cumberland Presbyterians and Old Presbyterians, have also made
                                    various attempts to gather the people into their respective churches; but scarcely
                                    any could be induced to forsake the original connexion which they had formed. During
                                    the last two or three years these congregations have occasionally been visited by

                                    agency in the far West. It requires an excellent constitution and an enthusiastic
                                    zeal, to persevere in an undertaking of this kind. You are not hence to infer that I
                                    feel discouraged; no, through the grace of God I am resolved to go on, and hope that
                                    much good will result from our Missionary exertions.</p>

                                    uncomfortably seated, to make my third monthly report.</p>
                        <p>The first week in March I remained in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> during April, and leaving some appointments accordingly, I pursued my
                                    journey to some of the more northern counties in this state. On the 10th of March, I
                                    attended the funerals of a mother and her grown son, in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Jackson County</region>
                                    </placeName>. In attempting to speak at the grave, I was prevented from proceeding
                                    by the noisy lamentations of the mourners.</p>
                        <p>Jackson County, like Union, is a hilly, timbered, tract of country, except towards
                                    its north-eastern parts, where the prairies commence. Some of these prairies contain
                                    a few German families, but their number at present is not sufficient to form
                                    Congregations. Pursuing a direct north course, I travelled across large prairies,
                                    through Perry, <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>, <region type="county">Clinton</region>

                                    </placeName> I found Br. Daniel Sherer, at present the only resident Lutheran
                                    Minister in the state of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName>. The members of Br. Sherer's congregation have commenced
                                    building a large two-story frame meeting-house, and appear in other respects willing
                                    to do their part, in promoting the good cause. A few weeks ago, when brother
                                    Haverstick preached here, the people contributed about five dollars to aid in
                                    sending the gospel to our destitute brethren. This is more than some of our
                                    congregations in the old states appear willing to do.</p>
                        <p>Hillsborough is a healthy and flourishing town, situated in an elevated region,
                                    containing about 250 inhabitants. On Tuesday evening, March 15th, I addressed a part
                                    of brother Sherer's congregation; and on Wednesday morning continued my

                                    country and inquired for Germans, I found but few of them. Being kindly received by
                                    an old Kentuckian, I appointed preaching in his house on Sunday morning, March 20th.
                                    When the people assembled, there appeared to be no need of German preaching; and I
                                    became acquainted only with one Lutheran family, from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. A Lutheran preacher in this county appeared to be a novelty; but very
                                    few had ever heard a minister of that denomination. On Monday morning, March 21st, I
                                    directed my course towards Beardstown, on the <geogName>Illinois river</geogName>.
                                    Here I found a number of European Germans, many of whom desire that a Lutheran
                                    minister might be settled among them. The number of Germans in and around
                                    Beardstown, is said to amount to about 200. After visiting a number of families, I
                                    appointed preaching on the 30th March, when I expect to be on my way back towards <placeName>

                                    25th. Hearing of a German settlement on the east side of the river, I resolved to
                                    spend Sunday among them. The number of families settled on a circumference of 3 or 4
                                    miles, amounts to twelve or fifteen, all new beginners, but truly desirous to enjoy
                                    the means of grace. On Sunday morning, I administered the Lord's Supper to
                                    about twenty communicants, in a section of country where but a few years ago the
                                    savage roamed and heathenish darkness reigned. A few individuals to express their
                                    gratitude, contributed two dollars without my request. After the congregation was
                                    dismissed, I received a pressing invitation to visit a few German families twenty

                                    Germans of any other county in the state. Many of them are nominally Lutherans;
                                    besides these, there are Atheists, Deists, and Romanists. This will be a difficult

                                    best be able to answer. In my opinion, young men of suitable qualifications should
                                    be sent, under the direction of our Central Missionary Society. An elderly brother
                                    ought to travel from station to station, be present at communion seasons, report to
                                    the Executive Committee, and assist the young brethren who might from time to time
                                    exchange stations, as much as lay in their power. If this be done, we shall soon be
                                    able to form a Lutheran Synod in the state of <placeName>

                                    regions of the West.</p>
                        <p>I would again remark, that ministers of ours, who have families, ought not for the
                                    present at least, to think of moving to this western country, unless they intend
                                    farming. The stations are too weak to support a man with family, and the increase
                                    will not be so rapid as some imagine. The living in this <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Western country</region>
                                    </placeName> is far from being cheap; store goods sell a hundred per cent higher
                                    here than to the east; grain and other provisions are likewise high at this time,
                                    and I find travelling as expensive here as in the eastern states. The country
                                    otherwise is a pleasant one, containing large bodies of rich land; some sections
                                    however are sickly.</p>

                                    the same day, to the <geogName>Mackinaw River</geogName>, where I had promised to
                                    visit a small German settlement. On Tuesday morning, March 29th, I preached and
                                    administered the Lord's Supper to a few Lutheran families, who had been
                                    living in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tazewell County</region>
                                    </placeName>, for five years, without hearing or seeing a minister of their own
                                    Church. Immediately after service I started, without waiting for dinner, taking a
                                    crust of bread in my pocket, still indulging the hope that I should be able to reach
                                    my appointment in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Beardstown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, on the 30th of March, by riding part of the night. About sundown I got
                                    to Salt Creek, 25 miles from the <geogName>Mackinaw river</geogName>, where the
                                    people told me that it would be very difficult to travel the road from thence to
                                    Beardstown, in day-time, on account of high waters, sloughs, &amp;c. and
                                    altogether impossible to proceed during the night. The distance I desired to go yet,
                                    by next morning, 11 o'clock, was 40 miles. Compelled to yield, though
                                    reluctantly, to the difficulties in my road, I found that by undertaking too much,
                                    we sometimes accomplish the less. A poor but pious family, by the name of Ingel,
                                    entertained me kindly during the night. The Germans, however, who expected me to
                                    preach for them in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Beardstown</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, on the 30th of March, were disappointed; nor has it been in my power
                                    to visit them since.</p>
                        <p>Beardstown is situated on the <geogName>Illinois river</geogName>, in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                                    </placeName>, on elevated ground, sandy soil, entirely above the highest floods. It
                                    has several steam mills, a printing office, nine stores, &amp; c. The population
                                    of the town is about 700. The Germans in and around Beardstown, are estimated at
                                    200, among them a number of young persons, who desire to be instructed, and to be
                                    received as members of the church. As soon as possible, your Executive Committee
                                    should send a minister of our connexion to reside among them.</p>
                        <p>On Good Friday, I addressed a few persons in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                                    </placeName>. April 3d, being Easter Sunday, I preached for brother Daniel Sherer,
                                    in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hillsborough</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, to a respectable and attentive audience. Brother Sherer would be

                                    </placeName>, I visited a colony of <placeName>

                                    </placeName> people, lately settled in Jackson Co. The most of them profess to be
                                    Congregationalists; and finding our mode of worship similar to theirs, they
                                    expressed the wish I would visit them again. Ministers of our Church will be kindly
                                    received by them; inquire for Mr. Lovejoy, or Mr. Tuthill, twelve or fourteen miles
                                    north from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Friday, April 8th, I preached on the ridge, in the southern extremity
                                    of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Jackson County</region>
                                    </placeName>, where I found some Lutheran families from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                                    </placeName>. A minister residing in or near <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, would consider this as one of his preaching places. April 9th, I
                                    attended according to appointment, in Union church, and preached Mrs.
                                    Lehty's funeral. On Sunday, April 10th, my appointment was in St.
                                    John's church, where I officiated in both languages, and informed the
                                    people that by Divine permission, the Lord's Supper would be administered
                                    in the same place next Sunday.</p>
                        <p>Desirous to visit some German settlements in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                                    </placeName>, I crossed the <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>, April 12th. At
                                    Major Bullinger's it was stated that a young German minister had been
                                    laboring among the people for two or three years past, and that they were well
                                    pleased with him. Not wishing to make appointments without his knowledge, I inquired
                                    for his place of residence, and set out to visit him. After crossing the Castor, I
                                    rode near to the <geogName>St. Francis river</geogName>, about sixty miles west of
                                    the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>

                                    </placeName>, Mo. before I found the Rev. F. Picker. He informed me that he had
                                    attached himself to the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName> Conference, attended to eight or nine different settlements, and
                                    received 75 or 80 dollars a year for his services. Mr. P. is a regularly educated
                                    German, a man of popular talents and industrious habits, well spoken of by his
                                    parishoners. Twenty miles farther west, beyond the <geogName>St. Francis
                                    river</geogName>, a Mr. Conrad has taken up his residence, who preaches
                                    occasionally, and calls himself a Lutheran, but is not so well spoken of as Mr.
                                    Picker. In order to reach my appointments in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName>, I found it necessary to return and move towards the east next morning,
                                    without preaching in this section of country. As far back as 1799, <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-071-1-048"/> Germans from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                                    </placeName> commenced to settle here; consequently, at a time when the Spaniards
                                    had possession of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. Girardeau, <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                                    </placeName> and other adjacent counties, may be rich in minerals, but with the
                                    exception of some bottom land along the water courses, I saw little else than ridges
                                    of flintstone and hills of gravel. Earthquakes have frequently been felt in this
                                    region of country; and some years ago, New Madrid was much injured by one of
                                        them.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> At this time the current of emigration is altogether
                                    to the more northern counties in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                                    </placeName>; hence the settlements here appear to be stationary, and are not
                                    increasing.</p>
                        <p>Late on Friday evening I arrived in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Union County</region>
                                    </placeName>. On Saturday I attended to the preparatory exercises; and on Sunday,
                                    April 17th, after preaching twice, I administered the Lord's Supper to
                                    between thirty and forty communicants. The season was solemn and interesting. The
                                    members of this church enjoined it upon me again to state their case to your
                                    Committee, and earnestly desire that a minister may be stationed among them, without
                                    delay. The collection taken and handed over to me, amounted to $9.45.</p>
                        <p>My last appointment in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Union County</region>
                                    </placeName>, I attended to on Tuesday, April 19th. Here I received for Missionary
                                    purposes, from Theob. Lentz 1 dollar; from Jacob Single 50 cts; from Zach Lyerley 25
                                    cts. and from some other individuals $2.20.</p>
                        <p>From Wednesday morning to Friday evening, I travelled 130 miles, in order to meet
                                    brother Haverstick in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                                    </placeName>; and on Saturday, April 23d, the long desired interview between the
                                    first Lutheran Missionaries in the far West took place. In the afternoon we attended
                                    to the preparatory exercises, inaugurated two elders and four deacons, and admitted
                                    fifteen new members, who had received religious instruction during brother
                                    Haverstick's six weeks residence in <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. During Sunday we both preached, and administered the Lord's
                                    Supper to about sixty communicants. <list type="footnotes">

                                    three Methodist ministers.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> The collection taken on this
                                    occasion amounted to more than thirty dollars. The members of this newly organized
                                    congregation, have also purchased eighty acres of land, intended for a parsonage.
                                    One of the brethren present promised to write an account of the important and
                                    appropriate exercises of this day, for the Observer, which no doubt, will be read
                                    with much interest. On Tuesday morning, brother Haverstick left <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, on his return to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>. The members of the congregation were very reluctant to part with him.
                                    This day, April 28th, I am attending a meeting of the Palestine Presbytery, in hope
                                    of receiving some information relative to German settlements. By request I preached
                                    the first sermon on this occasion.</p>
                        <p>In justice to myself and horse, I must rest a few days, and have therefore resolved
                                    to remain in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash County</region>
                                    </placeName>, until the second week in May, intending to urge the brethren onward in
                                    building their meeting house.</p>
                        <p>During the month of April, I have travelled more than 600 miles, preached 14 or 15
                                    times, baptised 13, and administered the Lord's Supper to more than 100
                                    communicants. But unless some of our young brethren can be induced to come to the
                                    West and take charge of these new congregations, it cannot be expected that our
                                    cause will prosper. I would therefore in behalf of our destitute brethren, raise the
                                    Macedonian cry "Come over and help us!" Indeed the harvest is
                                    great, but the laborers are few. I would say unto our young brethren in the
                                    ministry, remember that we are not our own; we are bought with a price; let us
                                    therefore glorify God in our bodies and in our spirits, which are God['s].</p>

                        <salute>Dear Brother—</salute>
                        <p>From the information communicated by the members of the Palestine Presbytery, it
                                    appears that a few German families have settled in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> above <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> Co., along the Indiana State line; but I heard of no Lutheran
                                    settlements in that direction, where, at present, congregations could be organized.
                                    Therefore, on Saturday, April 30, having delivered another message by request of the
                                    Moderator, I returned to <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> Co., and preached once more to the brethren who are engaged in the
                                    building of a brick church. The services were conducted both in the German and
                                    English language.</p>
                        <p>The first week in May, though not without employment, was a week of comparative rest.
                                    I spent my time agreeably and I trust usefully, in visiting the members of the
                                    congregation; writing letters for them to their friends in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName> relative to the Lord's doings among them; giving advice and
                                    encouragement concerning the building of the meeting house, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Sunday, May 8, I preached in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                                    </placeName> twice, and attended a third appointment in Centreville, between three
                                    and four o'clock in the afternoon. It is but just to state, that our
                                    Methodist brethren in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Mt. Carmel</settlement>
                                    </placeName> have been very accommodating in putting off their own appointments to
                                    let me occupy their meeting house, on various occasions. In addition to this they
                                    contributed liberally to the collection which was taken after the English sermon to
                                    aid our Central Missionary Society. (Amount collected—$7.25.)</p>

                                    region to shake hands, and sing and pray and preach together. Br. Reck has three or
                                    four regular preaching places, and preparatory steps have already been taken in two
                                    of the settlements to erect new meeting houses. I have no doubt our zealous and
                                    active brother will also succeed, by divine assistance, in collecting a Lutheran

                                    collected at the house of Mr. King English, mostly members of the Lutheran church.
                                    In the afternoon I travelled twenty two miles east to <placeName>

                                    as minister of the gospel; he preaches in different places through the country, but
                                    depends on his little farm and the practice of medicine for support.</p>

                                    pointed out to them wherein they misapprehended things. However, I think it is very
                                    important that an understanding should take place between the Indiana Synod and the

                                    consist of a mixture of gravel and clay. The timber consists of beech, poplar, ash,
                                    sugar-tree, hickory and oak. This county contains a considerable German population,
                                    who belong to various Christian denominations. Lutheranism has got somewhat into
                                    disrepute, on account of unsuitable men, who at different times have visited this
                                    section of country, and preached among the people as Lutheran ministers. But
                                    notwithstanding there are four congregations still in existence, which no doubt
                                    would greatly increase, if a pious and active minister were stationed among them.
                                    The people were quite anxious that Brother Rizer should take charge of this

                                    The congregation in Boon[e] County, Ky. which numbers about sixty communicants,
                                    lately collected 18 dollars in aid of the Central Missionary Society, thereby
                                    manifesting greater zeal in this important undertaking, than many of our larger
                                    congregations to the East. Of this collection eight dollars had been sent on to the
                                    treasurer; the remaining ten dollars Brother Crigler paid me as Agent of the

                                    still more. The treasurer of this society, Mr. Koenig, in accordance with a
                                    resolution passed, paid me twenty-five dollars, in aid of our Western Missions. This
                                    will appear the more remarkable, when it is recollected that a year or two ago it
                                    was thought that the church must be sold for debt, and the congregation be
                                    scattered. But since Br. Lauer has commenced his labors here, things have taken
                                    quite a favorable turn;—the congregation is increasing—the
                                    debt is greatly reduced, and a willingness is manifested to aid their German
                                    brethren who have removed to the West. It has afforded me much pleasure to become
                                    acquainted with some pious and zealous members of this congregation, and I trust
                                    that they will find from happy experience, what others can testify, that giving unto
                                    the Lord does not impoverish a congregation. Rev. Mr. Raschig of the German Reformed

                                            home missionary organization in America on a national scale, was formed in
                                            1826 and was interdenominational. At first the society was largely
                                            Presbyterian in membership, but during the 1830s the Lutheran church became
                                            affiliated with it as did the missionary societies of numerous other
                                            denominations. The society did great work in spreading Christian
                                            institutions in the West and supported weak churches in all sections of the
                                            country. One of the first German missionaries employed by the American Home

                                    their souls and they love him. Among his people I found some of the Pietists of <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName>. They are persons who love the Lord in sincerity and delight much to
                                    speak of his name. They meet every Sabbath morning to learn the English la[nguage].
                                        …<hi rend="sup">42</hi> I asked them why, in their advanced age, they
                                    were so anxious to learn English language. They replied that they found among their
                                    English neighbors a number who loved the Lord, and they wished to be able to
                                    converse and worship with them. If all Christians were so minded as these people,
                                    they would, like the saints of old, (Mal. 3–16) "speak often one
                                    to another" of the things which concern their peace, teaching and
                                    admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and thus
                                    strengthen, encourage and edify each other in the service of their Lord. Mr. Swartz
                                    has so far preached in a school-house, but his congregation is now building a brick
                                    house, forty by fifty, which will be ready for use in a few months. In the afternoon
                                    I preached, by request of the Rev. Browning, in the Meth. Ep Church and became
                                    acquainted with a few English families, who belong to the Lutheran Church, but are
                                    obliged to go elsewhere to enjoy the means of grace. They expressed a great desire
                                    that a Lutheran congregation should be organized among them; but this I think,
                                    cannot be done <list type="footnotes">

                                    patience to organize such an one as will be able to support a minister. I was told
                                    that not more than one half of the permanent residents of the place belong to the
                                    church of Christ. But in the West, it is not so easy to bring persons into the
                                    church as in the East. The fever of enterprise and speculation rages among the
                                    western folks to such a degree, that most are unwilling to devote any of their time
                                    and much less any of their money to religious matters. This is a fact which should
                                    be particularly noticed in calculating our prospects of organizing congregations in
                                    the West, and especially in the Western cities. Our congregations as a general
                                    thing, must be formed out of materials that are yet unoccupied, and of such there is
                                    a great abundance in the western towns and cities; but to bring them into proper
                                    shape and form, is a work attended with more difficulties than persons in the East
                                    generally suppose.</p>
                        <p>I would say the same things in reference to organizing an English Lutheran

                                    Congregations, cannot preach in the English language; if they could, they might
                                    whilst they are tending to and supported by the German, also gradually raise English
                                    congregations. There is a vast deal of immorality in each of these rapidly growing
                                    cities, and if the Christian community do not co-operate with zeal and energy to
                                    stem the torrent of vice, and make their various <hi rend="i">moralizing</hi>

                                    there will be such a moral wilderness in these western cities as will be exceedingly
                                    difficult yea, impossible to change to any extent into a garden of the Lord. And I
                                    do most earnestly wish that the great Head of the church would enable by some means
                                    or other, our zion to do something in this great and necessary work.</p>

                                    </placeName>, I became acquainted with a number of our clerical brethren. I was
                                    kindly received and politely treated by them all. The ministers in this State, and
                                    in the West generally, have more laborious charges than those in the East. The
                                    congregations are small and they must attend to many to get a competent support.
                                    Some have charge of 7 and 8, and these at great <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-071-1-061"/>

                                    impassable. This makes their work arduous and very severe. The church of this State
                                    is already large, and probably destined to be as numerous as in any state in the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>. It was divided into two distinct Synods, which meet separately twice
                                    in succession, and every third year jointly. An English Synod has also been formed,
                                    which is already pretty numerous and seems to be quite active in promoting the
                                    welfare of our destitute brethren in the West. They have lately had the Augsburg
                                    Confession translated into English, and also an English Liturgy prepared. They are

                                    this, has charge of several congregations. The ministers of this State also complain
                                    that they are not able to find a sufficient number of young men who are willing to
                                    dedicate themselves wholly to the Lord in the Gospel ministry. And hence the
                                    desolations of our zion cannot be repaired and her walls not built up and

                                            confession of the Lutheran church. Characteristics of the confession include

                                            opposed the narrow confessional distinctions of its day and was not
                                            concerned about the denominational affiliation of its graduates.
                                            Basel's catholicity was manifested in its close cooperation with

                                            </placeName>, the society also gradually developed the policy of assisting
                                            German colonists in America. The first missionaries from Basal arrived in

                                    death. When he had returned to Europe, he was advised to go to America, the society
                                    in whose service he labored in Africa, promising to support him in part until he
                                    could support himself, this advice he followed and is now in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, but has no particular field of labor and supports himself by medical
                                    practice. He is very anxious to be located in the vicinity of some Indian tribe,
                                    that he might gradually establish himself among them. I advised him to apply to the
                                    American Home Miss. Society for employment, which after having heard the plan of
                                    that society, he cordially consented to do, and I hope and pray that this devoted
                                    brother, who has surely the cause of God at heart, may by the direction of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, be placed in a station of great usefulness in the western and
                                    destitute part of our land. Mr. Metzger also soon lost his wife and then married a
                                    native mulatto of the colony, but was soon compelled on account of ill health, to
                                    leave this unhospitable clime and is now located in the northern part of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, but is much embarrassed and suffers many inconveniences from the fact
                                    that his companion is an African. It is to be regretted that American Christians are
                                    so apt to forget that the royal law is "love thy neighbor as
                                    thyself," and that it is written "God made of one blood all
                                    nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth." (Acts
                                    17–26.) We hope that Mr. Metzger, by preaching these cardinal, prominent
                                    truths of the Christian system, will soon be able to put away that unreasonable
                                    prejudice which now militates so much against his usefulness. I would also inform
                                    you that there has lately been a large society formed in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> for the purpose of opening free schools in the different towns and
                                    cities of our country for the benefit of emigrants. It has been discovered that most
                                    of the children of emigrants are made the objects of scorn and ridicule in our
                                    ordinary schools on account of their language, peculiar dress and manners, and hence
                                    many are prevented from enjoying the means of instruction which are extended to
                                    them. To remedy this difficulty, this noble society is endeavoring to raise funds
                                    sufficient to open schools, in which none but emigrants' children are to be
                                    taught, and in which the bible is to be a <hi rend="i">text</hi> book; and thus
                                    these neglected ones of our infant population will not only be made acquainted with
                                    the elements of learning, but also with the Holy Bible, and thus will not remain nor
                                    become the <hi rend="i">slaves of papal</hi> tyranny, but will become good
                                    protestants, good republicans, <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-071-1-064"/> good citizens and
                                    good Christians. It is expected that Col. Lemonowsky will be appointed general agent
                                    of the society. May the Lord prosper their philanthropic cause and make much good to
                                    flow from it.</p>
                        <p>From Boone Co. where the Synod met, I proceeded through the northern part of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                                    </placeName>, a distance of about one hundred miles. In this part of the state I
                                    found no members and no knowledge of our church. Several times, when I told the
                                    people that I was a Lutheran minister, I was asked whether I was not a <hi rend="i">catholic priest</hi>, or a <hi rend="i">Cambelite</hi> or a former of a new
                                    sect. So shamefully ignorant are Christians in this part of the country that <hi rend="i">some</hi> do not know that the Lutheran is the <hi rend="i">oldest</hi>
                                    Protestant Church in existence; and others think that the Lutheran and Catholic
                                    Churches are the <hi rend="i">same.</hi> The latter however are somewhat excusable,
                                    for there are many works published which slanderously accuse us of holding and
                                    teaching many of the errors of the Roman Church; among these works is
                                    Buck's Theological Dictionary and a work of the same kind, just published,
                                    which is called the Religious Gazeteer, this work is extensively distributed in this

                                    live in a fertile land but are destitute of one who would break unto them the bread
                                    of life. About fifty more have been confirmed, which would already constitute a
                                    pretty large congregation. They have been in the habit of meeting every other
                                    Sabbath to exercise themselves in vocal music, and every other Sabbath for divine
                                    worship, at which time, they usually sing a few hymns, one reads prayers and a
                                    discourse out of a book of sermons. They more lately formed themselves into a
                                    society for the purpose of supplying the necessitous and providing for the education
                                    of their children. They are anxious to have a minister to preach to them in their

                                    they would receive a German minister of any orthodox denomination, but as they were
                                    taught and reared in the German Reformed Church, a minister of that order could be
                                    most useful among them. Inquire for M. Feghoeffer or Bruener.</p>

                                    church. They have no preaching of any kind, but are anxious to obtain a minister but
                                    cannot do much towards his support. They lodged here in the woods a few years ago,
                                    laid out their money in lands and have now little cabins to live in with a little

                                            a new "house for worship 30 by 35 feet, of logs," which
                                            one of his congregations had constructed just east of the Indiana capital.
                                            What had made the occasion even more interesting, Reck wrote, was that
                                            "our young brother Ezra Keller just happened with us, as Missionary
                                            of the East Pa. Synod, and preached and aided in the solemnities of the

                                    those who are hungering after the bread of life, as sheep without a shepherd. Often
                                    have I been able to realize the feelings of our blessed Lord when it is said of him,
                                    "that when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them,
                                    because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no
                                    shepherd." (Math. 9–36.) I was, at this place, a short distance
                                    from the Miami Reserve. This reserve is thirty-six miles square and contains about
                                    2500 Indians.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> I was told that there is no Missionary among
                                    them. I had a great desire to preach to them but could not make it suit to do so.
                                    There are many French traders among them, who have amalgamated with them by marriage
                                    and have much degraded them both physically and morally. It is indeed deplorable to
                                    hear how these noble-minded children of the forest have been demoralized, instead of
                                    improved by the white people. These traders give them so much liquor as will
                                    intoxicate them and then defraud them in a most shameful manner. Every vice they
                                    teach them. Many species of wickedness of which the Indians know nothing, these
                                    traders introduce among them, and at the same time are devoted beadsmen and have
                                    their god hanging on their breast in the form of a crucifix. This is a very noble
                                    tribe of Indians. They have a very friendly disposition, and indeed would be happy
                                    if it were not for the spirituous liquors in their reach of which they are so very
                                    fond. Every thing they see, seems to delight them. They are continually smiling and
                                    talking. O that they were converted to God and had his love shed abroad in their
                                    hearts, what an amiable, cheerful, happy race of men they would be!</p>

                                    church and some of the German Reformed church, who wish to be organized into one
                                    congregation by a minister of either of these two churches. The town is rapidly
                                    growing in population and commercial importance. There are five or six towns in the
                                    vicinity around, at each of which it is highly probable that congregations might be
                                        organized.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> The Missionary Board of the German Reformed
                                    Church has been applied to for a Missionary, and if they do not furnish them one,
                                    our church should endeavor to do so. With the aid of $150 from a
                                    Missionary Society a man might be supported here for the first year and perhaps
                                    after that he would not need foreign aid. Inquire for Messrs W. Hoffman and Uhler.
                                    Thus far I have acted the part of an exploring missionary, but in a few days I

                        <p>On my way to this place I heard of a German settlement on Mill-creek near a little
                                    town called <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Jacksonville</settlement>

                                    from doing so. Inquire for Mr. Meyers.</p>
                        <p>I have now through the kind providence of God, visited nearly all the settlements of
                                    destitute members, in this state, as far as I have been able to get information.
                                    There are some in the southern and south-eastern part which I did not visit, but
                                    will do so on my return.</p>
                        <p>In my travels I availed myself of every opportunity to get information concerning the
                                    moral condition of Indiana and the results of my inquiries and observations I shall
                                    now communicate to you.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that fully <hi rend="i">two thirds</hi> of the adult population of the
                                    state belong to no church whatever. These persons, who are properly termed
                                    Nothingarians, are generally not avowed infidels or scepticks, but are men who fully
                                    credit the Bible and manifest considerable respect for the Christian religion and
                                    take some interest in its promotion. Others and perhaps the large majority of this
                                    class, whilst they admit the divine origin of the Christian religion, care nothing
                                    at all about its promotion, injunctions or requirements. They are perfect worldings,
                                    spend all their strength in Mammon's sinful empire and waste their thoughts
                                    in buying and selling and getting gain. Others are grossly immoral and are running
                                    fast to perdition. The religious class of the community is very much divided. The
                                    Baptists are perhaps the most numerous and are divided into the regular, Cambelite
                                    and Dunker Baptists. The regular Baptists in this state and in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                                    </placeName> do not deserve the praise which their brethren in the East do.
                                    Charitably speaking they are a people of whom it is hard to say good things. They
                                    exert an influence, and a powerful influence, which is decidedly detrimental to the
                                    moral welfare of Indiana. They discourage all those schemes of doing good which
                                    characterize the present glorious age. Bible, Tract and Temperance Societies they
                                    hate with a perfect hatred. To subscribe a temperance pledge is a crime sufficiently
                                    heinous to expel any member from the <pb n="66" id="VAA4025-071-1-070"/> church. In
                                    many places they have formed societies for the express purpose of suppressing these
                                    wicked plans of doing good. In their estimation a missionary is a perfect scoundrel,
                                    a base villain—a pest to human society. The Sabbath of the Lord they
                                    totally disregard and an educated ministry they will not have. The character of the
                                    Cambelite and Dunker Baptists in the West is the same as in the East.</p>
                        <p>The Methodists rank next to the Baptists in number. They have displayed a laudable
                                    degree of zeal and enterprize in building up churches in every part of this state.
                                    In every village and neighborhood almost, is found a society of Methodists, but
                                    generally small. In this state there are more preachers among [the]m than any where
                                    else. Every town, vil[la]ge and neighborhood has one, two, three or four local
                                    preachers. In fact, in some places all seem to be preachers. Why this policy has
                                    been adopted I am at a loss to tell, I am sure it is not a good one. Among this host
                                    of preachers there are very many who are by [no] means able to discharge the
                                    important functions of the ministry. They wish to preach but cannot.</p>
                        <p>They are an object of pity to some and a laughing stock to others. The multitude run
                                    not because it is interesting, but because it is <hi rend="i">ludicrous</hi> to
                                    hear. The pulpit is made a stage of clowns, preaching an amusement and the gospel
                                    ministry an office of no importance nor dignity. The truth of these remarks is
                                    evident to all who are acquainted in this part of the country and it is a matter of
                                    regret to all who wish to see Zion prosper and her ministers respected that they may
                                    be useful.</p>
                        <p>The Presbyterian church is also pretty strong in some parts of this state. Many of
                                    their ministers support themselves in part, from the produce of their farms, others
                                    are partly sustained by the Home Missionary Society. They have several colleges
                                    established, which are under the supervision of able professors and promise to be
                                    very useful.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                                    but do not know how to make one which will abide the text of the Bible. In this
                                    state there are not many Roman Catholics.</p>
                        <p>The vices which prevail to the greatest extent in this state are, 1st. Sabbath
                                    breaking. The Lords day is most shamefully profaned. Often do I hear guns discharged
                                    when preaching on the Sabbath. To go to mill, to make contracts, to chop wood, to
                                    hunt game, &amp;c, are the common employments of many people on the Sabbath.
                                    They do not like the practice of esteeming one day above another. 2d. Intemperance
                                    also prevails in some parts of this state and particularly in the country of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName>. In the Eastern part of Indiana I did not discover much of this vice.
                                    In some parts indeed whiskey is not at all used. But in towns and villages along the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> many groceries are found. These groceries are nothing but grog-shops,
                                    filthy sinks of sin, the wretched hovels of vice. In some villages containing about
                                    three or four hundred souls I have counted six and seven groceries. In the morning
                                    you see scores flocking thither like so many thirsty swine to their troughs. In the
                                    evening you hear the muttering voice of the reeling drunkard, the sound of the
                                    violin and of the angry words of the quarrelling multitude. 3d Frolicking is another
                                    vice which prevails much in this state. Balls, cotillion-parties, &amp;c, are
                                    very frequent. To these bacchanalian feasts old and young men, women and children
                                    resort. Mothers I am told, go with their infants on their arms, lay them down for a
                                    while and dance with merriment around the altar of their father—their
                                    god, the devil.</p>
                        <p>Alas! for them! for they destroy not only themselves but also their children. There
                                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] gatherings are kept in some villages along the <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                                    </placeName> with much regularity, in some weekly, in others semi-monthly and
                                    monthly. The whole live-long night are they heard thumping on the floor, too drunk
                                    to dance. In the morning the streets are filled with drunken men and perhaps the
                                    chambers with drunken women. These parties are the destruction of the youthful part
                                    of the community. They create luxury, indolence and wastefulness—they
                                    discourage industry and thriftiness. It is to be regretted that in many parts of our
                                    land these gatherings are supported and encouraged by Christians who hold them in
                                    miniature or with a better name when they call them religious <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-071-1-072"/> parties, or social meetings for spending an evening in
                                    friendly intercourse, when it is spending an evening in idle talk, courtship and
                                    spending money for luxuries which might have been thrown into the Lord's
                                    treasury.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties with which a minister of our church will meet in this state will
                                    arise firstly from the small number of members in one place.</p>
                        <p>Our members are much scattered about. There are not very many at one place and they
                                    are generally so circumstanced as not to [be] able to give much to support a
                                    minister. Many too, who have been living some years in this country, have lost the
                                    habit of supporting the gospel and of course, would contribute very sparingly.</p>
                        <p>The distances between the settlements are generally great and the roads bad. A
                                    minister must ride much and through the worst roads. I frequently travelled for
                                    miles in mud knee-deep and had myself and horse all o'er bespattered with
                                    mud and water. It will perhaps be more expensive for a minister in the West than in
                                    the East. Living at this time is an high as in the East. Clothing and horses will
                                    not wear long here for a man who wishes to do much.</p>
                        <p>A minister in this country is not so much respected as in the East, which operates
                                    against his usefulness. There have been and still are so many pretenders, persons,
                                    who gave themselves forth to be preachers of the gospel, and yet by their walk and
                                    conduct disgraced even the Christian name and much more the Christian ministry, so
                                    that the sacred office has been brought into great disrepute, and those even who
                                    hold it worthily do not command that degree of respect and influence, which their
                                    office should give them and which they must have to be useful. A man can not expect
                                    to be very useful in this community for the first few years. He must first show to
                                    the people his private character to remove their suspicions &amp; gain their
                                    confidence. Among the qualifications which a man, who wishes to labor in this field
                                    should have, is much knowledge of human nature, to be able to awaken an indifferent
                                    people to the importance of religious matters and spiritual things. This cannot be
                                    done by vain declamation, but by reasoning with the people and addressing those
                                    feelings and passions of the human heart which will excite attention and interest.</p>
                        <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-071-1-073"/>
                        <p>The people in this part of the country are also very fond of popular <hi rend="i">eloquence</hi> and learning. There is no community which execrate pretenders
                                    more than the western folks. As man should also be very well versed in the
                                    scriptures to support with divine authority the doctrines he preaches, for there has
                                    been so much wrangling and controversy on doctrinal points, that the people are not
                                    satisfied with mere assertions or with a small portion of proof, but they require an
                                    overwhelming amount of evidence and proof.</p>
                        <p>An intimate acquaintance with Natural Religion is also necessary. There are many
                                    persons in this community, who are perfect children of nature they have a good
                                    portion of native talent, of common sense, they have no artificial education, but
                                    are guided entirely by the light of Nature and place much more confidence in the
                                    teachings of reason, than of revelation.</p>
                        <p>To influence such persons, the dictates of reason and the lessons of Natural Religion
                                    must be mingled with those of the Bible. Let no one entertain the opinion that the
                                    weaker instruments should be sent to the West. This erroneous notion has been too
                                    prevalent in the ecclesiastical bodies of the East. If there be talent, learning and
                                    eloquence necessary in any part of the land, it is West of the Alleghany and in no
                                    place are eminent ministerial qualifications so much appreciated and so highly
                                    estimated as in this. In most places in this state a Lutheran minister should be
                                    able to preach in both languages, to endure privations, to suffer hardships and to
                                    labor with patience and hope amidst many discouragements.</p>
                        <p>Dear brethren, I cannot but recommend to your serious attention this state as a field
                                    which needs many efficient laborers. No state west of the mountains deserves more
                                    attention from the church in the East than this. The population is of such a
                                    character and society is in such a state that much ministerial labor should be
                                    expended here. Our German brethren are fast declining in piety and morality. The
                                    weeds of wickedness are springing up in every form and in frightful numbers.</p>
                        <p>If they be yet long neglected, the work of reforming them will be doubly great and
                                    tenfold more arduous. Already some have lost all hunger for worship and soon every
                                    door of access will be closed and they will be hardened people. <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-071-1-074"/> Now some are still crying for the bread of life, but
                                    soon they will cease to hunger and refuse to take, when it is appeased. Who will go
                                    to feed these lambs? Yes, the Lord asks, who will go? yes he actually commands <hi rend="i">us</hi>, like Peter to feed these his sheep and take care of these his
                                    lambs. Brethren let us pray more, that a way may be opened for each one of us to do
                                    something in this great work. Let us pray the Lord of the harvest that he may put it
                                    into the hearts of many young men in our church to devote themselves to God in the
                                    gospel ministry. In your prayers remember me, who, in the providence of God have
                                    been appointed to a work which I feel to be almost too great for me, after the flesh
                                    become unwilling and the spirit faint in this arduous task, but I have hope in the
                                    all-sustaining grace of God. Jesus hath said, "I will be with you"
                                    and so far I have realized his promise. May the Lord prosper you.</p>

                                        <settlement type="city">Grand Prairie</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to Peoria on the <geogName>Illinois river</geogName>, a distance of 130
                                    miles. This journey I long dreaded on account of the snow and cold. But being
                                    blessed with pretty good weather and very good company, I made it as pleasantly and
                                    safely as could be expected. If any of you should ever be obliged to make this
                                    journey in the winter I would advise you not to undertake it without company. If any
                                    thing like a deep snow falls, no road can be discerned in these prairies and the
                                    traveller must guide himself entirely by the compass and one alone is apt to become
                                    bewildered. These prairies are very extensive, often in a distance from 14 to 20

                        <p>The first German settlement, I found in this state is that which Rev. Hyer [Heyer]
                                    visited in the spring of 1836. These people live about seven miles north-east of
                                    Peoria on Farm creek. They were very glad when they heard who I was and that I was
                                    sent by a Synod in the East to visit them and minister to their spiritual
                                    wants—several with tearful eyes remarked; "this is not from man
                                    alone, it is from God. The good Lord led these men to provide for our spiritual
                                    destitution:" In this neighborhood there are about 50 families of Germans
                                    but most of them belong to the Ahmish Baptist church who, in spirit and practice,
                                    are like the Menonites and will hold no communion with other Christians. There are
                                    about 85 members of our church in this vicinity. I continued among them six days,
                                    visited most of the families and preached to them a number of times, baptised four
                                    infants and administered the Lord's supper to 29 communicants. I never met
                                    a people more hungry for the bread of life than these, and my joy in breaking it to
                                    them was commensurate with their hunger. So delightful it is to preach to hungry
                                    souls that I forgot the sufferings of my journey to them. They are very anxious to
                                    have regular preaching and would reward a man for his labor to the utmost of their
                                    ability. Their children are growing up without religious instruction and their dead
                                    are buried without the presence of a minister of peace to give consolation to the
                                    distressed and instruction to the living. When I bid them adieu they surrounded me
                                    weeping and asking most importunately that they might not be forgotten but soon
                                    visited again. The scene was one of great distress to my soul and I shall not soon
                                    forget it. Oh that Christians would weep more over the desolations of our Zion, then
                                    would the Lord raise up laborers to repair her walls and fasten her gates and make
                                    her glorious in the earth. These people formerly gathered every Sabbath to read a
                                    church-service, but a certain Mr. Staubus, a vagabond preacher, came among them and
                                    caused some disturbance, and put an end to this excellent practice. Enquire for
                                    Messrs. Gimmel, Koek, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>From this place, I was kindly conducted by one of the members into a settlement about
                                    14 miles north-west of this on Blue Creek. Here I found 15 members and some more are
                                    expected. The people had not heard a sermon since they are in this country. In this
                                    neighborhood there are some Catholic families, who are quite liberal.—I
                                    baptised their children and they communed with us at the Lord's table.
                                    Inquire for Sciford, Brownfield, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>From this place I had intended to proceed up the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> as far as Attowa [Ottowa], but on account of the snow and ice it was
                                    dangerous to go on horse-back and the boats have been stopped by the ice on the
                                    river, so prevented from going. At Attoway, I was told, are many members of the
                                    church from <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                                    </placeName>, who are anxious to have a minister. At Heniken and Black-Partridge are
                                    also some, which should be visited.</p>
                        <p>From this, I went to Peoria or Ft. Clark, which is one of the most flourishing town
                                    in the West. It enjoys the advantages of a very fertile vicinity, and of a stream
                                    that is navigable eight months in a year, and is undoubtedly destined to be very
                                    great in population and commercial importance. Here I found 20 communicant
                                    members—some from the East and some from <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName>. They are very anxious to have a minister who can preach in both
                                    languages and offer to contribute very liberally to his support. A man of suitable
                                    qualification located at this place and preaching for the two settlements already
                                    mentioned, would have a large field of usefulness before him and undoubtedly find a
                                    sufficiency of temporal support. The tide of emigration to this place and the
                                    surrounding country is extraordinary. House, smoke-house, and shop are filled with
                                    families. A room of ten feet square rents for seven and eight dollars. Every thing
                                    is so crowded with people that it is difficult for travellers to get lodging.
                                    Inquire for Meyer, Miller, &amp;c. Peoria has 1500 inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>From Peoria I proceeded down the <placeName>

                                    preaching and wickedness prevails. I found only two Lutheran families here. Enquire
                                    for the firm of Henkle &amp; Rupert. I found a small German settlement 96 miles
                                    northeast of this, on <geogName>Mackinaw river</geogName>. Here I found 15 members,
                                    but only 9 appeared at the Lord's table. These were vis[i]ted by the Rev.
                                    Hyer last spring. In this neighborhood, which, <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-071-1-077"/>
                                    in the course of time will be an earthly paradise, I found many good people of
                                    different Christian denominations. Enquire for Weirick or Shaumlefel.</p>
                        <p>From this place I went by way of Lewistown, to Beards-town, a distance of 80 miles.
                                    At this place, I was much surprised to find the Rev. F. W. Bolenius who was formerly
                                    a fellow-student with us. He came to this place last July, with his family, and
                                    became the pastor of the Germans in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Beardstown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and its vicinity—has been very much afflicted with
                                    sickness—lost his wife and two children, the whole amount of his family,
                                    by death. He has organized two congregations—one in the town containing
                                    42 communicants—and one in the country, containing 31 communicant
                                    members. In Beardstown and its neighborhood there are about 240 Germans, adult
                                    persons I pray that our brother may be useful in this community for it very much
                                    needs the [s]anctifying influence of divine truth.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday (Sabbath) I preached twice, once in German and once in
                                    English—preaching was tolerably well attended —but scarcely as
                                    well as the slaughter-house and game-field, for there were about 400 hogs
                                    slaughtered here yesterday and how much game was caught I [c]annot tell. This is
                                    nothing unusual for this place in this season. Laborers get twenty-five cents more
                                    on Sabbath than on other days and thus for twenty-five cents they profane the holy
                                    day of the Lord, and surely [s]uch persons would not hesitate for 30 piecee [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] [o]f silver to betray their Christ as Judas did of [o]ld.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, dear brethren, you are ready to [a]sk me questions about the hardships of
                                    such [a] tour as has been assigned me to make. You may easily conjecture that in
                                    making [s]uch a journey many things must be done and [ejndured which are unpleasant
                                    to the flesh [a]nd grievous to the spirit. And were these [t]hings performed and
                                    suffered in the service [o]f any other being but of the Lord, I should much and
                                    loudly complain of hardships, [c]rosses and trials; but in the cause of Christ
                                    [t]oils become delightful and sufferings sweet to the soul of the Christian. To
                                    travel alone [t]hrough mud, and snow and ice and rain—to [f]ace the

                                    thermometer is [b]elow zero, as it has been for the last two weeks,—to
                                    rest one's head on his saddle-[b]ags and his limbs on the floor of an open
                                    [c]abin, after having <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-071-1-078"/> been fatigued by a
                                    day's travel and exhausted by the cold—to cross large rivers on
                                    thin ice or shattered boats or to swim one's horse across rapid [s]treams,
                                    are things which are unpleasant to the flesh and trying to the
                                    spirits—but the thought that Jesus suffered ten thousand times more than
                                    all this amounts to, to purchase for <hi rend="i">us</hi> a crown of glory, makes
                                    all these sufferings comparatively delightsome.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The greatest
                                    hardship I must endure, and the only one of which I am disposed to complain, arises
                                    from the spiritual destitution of our members in the West. To see settlements of
                                    from 15 to 30 families entirely destitute of preaching, adult persons become
                                    reckless about the precepts of the gospel and the salvation of their souls, and the
                                    children growing under the destructive influence of bad example and without any
                                    religious instruction,—to hear pious mothers complain with tears that
                                    they have no one to take care of the souls of their children—to hear the
                                    petitions of hungry souls who have no one to break unto them the bread of life
                                    statedly—to preach to such people awhile, ascertain their wants and then
                                    leave them, as sheep without a shepherd, is a trial which my spirit can scarcely
                                    endure. This is truly a hardship. It has given me many a sorrowful hour. Frequently
                                    I have been able to realise the feelings of the blessed Saviour, when it is said of
                                    him "that he had compassion on the people because they were as sheep having
                                    no shepherd." I must now close the present letter. Continue, dear brethren,
                                    to remember me in your supplications whenever you address a throne of grace and

                                            "In crossing streams, I was several times in great danger of
                                            perishing," he wrote. "I crossed the <geogName>Kickapoo

                                            who were half drunk, commenced abusing them, and the boat was nigh upsetting

                        <p>In my last I gave you an account of the German settlements on the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> as far south as Beardstown. South of this not many Germans are found on
                                    this river. There are a few families in Naples and Meridosia and Carrollton. The
                                    next large settlement of Germans which I found in this state (Ill.) is at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>

                                    </placeName>, about 150 miles north of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>In this town, which has between 1000 and 1200 inhabitants, and its neighborhood there
                                    live about 50 families of European Germans and more are expected as soon as the
                                    navigation on the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> opens. Perhaps the half of these families are catholics, and all are
                                    without the regular preaching of the gospel and the stated administration of its
                                    sacraments and ordinances.</p>
                        <p>Among these people there are many who truly love the Saviour and his holy things.
                                    Last summer a man made his appearance among them in a garb of a minister of Christ;
                                    they soon made him heartily welcome as a messenger of God, and sincerely thought
                                    that the Lord had remembered their wants and supplied them; but it was a deception.
                                    The man was a genuine minister of satan, a missionary of the evil one, it was the
                                    notorious Hohnholtz, who for his ungodly deeds, was deprived of a catechet license
                                    by the Synod of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>. This is a most wicked and immoral man, he is given to every species of
                                    vice and gross wickedness. He continued among this people about two months, enjoying
                                    their kindness and <list type="footnotes">

                                    Esop's fabled ass, he lost his hypocritical garb and appeared in his true
                                    form and character, namely, a vile, wicked, abandoned wretch—a man who
                                    used the most sacred things and the most sacred office to accomplish the vilest
                                    purposes and achieve the most vicious deeds. His base actions I will not mention,
                                    they are not for the virtuous eye to read, nor for the holy heart to contemplate.
                                    After having been confined in prison several weeks he was released upon promise to
                                    flee the neighborhood. The last I heard of him was that he had been in Vandalia and
                                    attempted to preach. Such men have done a vast deal of mischief among the Germans in
                                    the West. Indeed, when I look upon the havoc, which such Iscariots have made upon
                                    immortal souls, I am astonished at the long suffering of God which permits such men
                                    to live and so to act. It is a wonder that they are not sent to perdition at the
                                    very commencement of their ungodly career. Surely God is not man, else this would be
                                    the case.</p>

                                    some unmarried persons. At Salmyra, sixteen miles from <placeName>

                                    </placeName> are eight or ten families. The places which I have now mentioned
                                    constitute a large field of labor and of usefulness.</p>
                        <p>At Alton I found Mr. Rieger from the Basle institution, who, with Mr. Wall came from
                                    Europe last summer. At this place there are about 60 Germans for whom Mr. Rieger
                                    preaches every Sabbath. Most of the persons are without families and not permanent
                                    residents and therefore Mr. Rieger has concluded to locate elsewhere. He seems to be
                                    a man of the right spirit. He has already gained the confidence and esteem of the
                                    whole Christian community of Alton, and I have no doubt he will, if spared, be an
                                    instrument of great usefulness among his countrymen in the West. In <placeName>

                                    What I have said of Mr. Rieger I could also say of Mr. Reese. He seems to be a very
                                    useful and excellent man.<hi rend="sup">59</hi>

                                    as pastor, but I expect he will be elected by the congregation when they will make
                                    choice of a pastor. It is difficult to tell how many members this congregation has,
                                    perhaps between 3 and 4 hundred regular communicant members. Hitherto they have
                                    worshipped in the Methodist Episcopal church, but they intend to build a house next
                                    summer. On Sabbath morning I attended, in the Presbyterian church a Sunday School
                                    into which none but Germans are admitted as pupils. It contains at this time, about
                                    120 scholars and is designed to teach them the English language in order to enable
                                    them to enjoy the religious advantages of which ignorance of the English deprives
                                    them. Its design is very good, and our prayers are for its prosperity.</p>

                                    Besides, having now already travelled 1500 on horse back, I am quite outdone and

                        <p>I will now give a general statement of the moral condition of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                                    </placeName> as I did of Indiana. From the information I could get I would judge the
                                    former to be far in advance of the latter in respect to morality and religion. Many
                                    of the inhabitants of this state and particularly of the northern part are from <placeName>
                                        <country>New England</country>
                                    </placeName>, and have brought with them that desire for intelligence, good order,
                                    good morals and improvements of every kind, which so much distinguished the states
                                    of their nativity. In this state, plans for disseminating wholesome knowledge and
                                    promoting morality and religion, are formed in great number and executed with much
                                    vigor and efficiency. Temperance, Tract, and Education Societies exist and operate
                                    in every county. It is somewhat surprising how liberally some congregations
                                    contribute to encourage these schemes of doing good. I know one congregation,
                                    composed in all of but 150 members, who give their minister $600; last
                                    new year, threw for a new-years gift to the Lord $600 into the Treasury
                                    of the Missionary Society; and besides this to support a general Missionary for the
                                    current year, which will cost them at least $400; to support a man to
                                    lecture on the Abolition of Slavery; and how much they give to the Education Society
                                    and other Societies I cannot tell. This is not the only congregation that
                                    contributes so liberally to the Lord but others could be mentioned with equal
                                    praise. And what should be especially noticed is that no congregations are <hi rend="i">becoming sa</hi> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] wealthy as those of the
                                    character just described.</p>
                        <p>In this state I became acquainted with several ministers of the Cumberland
                                    Presbyterian church. I was received by them with the greatest kindness. The friendly
                                    correspondents between the editor of our periodical and the editor of theirs has
                                    been of much utility. Frequently did I experience "how good and how
                                    pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." It is to be
                                    regretted that all Christian denominations do not forget their shiboleths and live
                                    in peace and friendship. In this state they have about 30 ordained ministers, 16
                                    licentrates, 1 Synod and 5 Presbyteries. They are <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-071-1-083"/> distinguished for their piety, humility and zeal. And these are the qualities
                                    which make them successful in doing good. It is indeed astonishing how fast their
                                    number multiplied.</p>
                        <p>Twenty six years ago (1810) the church was organized by <hi rend="i">three</hi>
                                    ordained ministers, and now as far as I can learn they have 1 Gen.
                                    Assembly—9 Synods—35 Presbyteries—300 ordained
                                    ministers—100 licentrates (catechists—and 50,000 communicants.
                                    They have also done something for Foreign Missions. May the Lord continue to prosper
                                    their efforts. The <hi rend="i">jerks</hi> which were formerly so prevalent in the
                                    West and so particularly among the Cumberlands are becoming less frequent. As this
                                    singular mental phenomenon is not known to most persons in the East, and as it is
                                    important for ministers to know it, I think it proper to give you a history of it.
                                    The person who has what in western parlance, is called the <hi rend="i">jerks</hi>,
                                    at once commences to swing his head with so much violence and frequency that
                                    spectators are astonished and alarmed. Sometimes females, who have the jerks, swing
                                    their head backwards and forwards with so much violence that their hairs crackle
                                    like a teamster's whip. This disease comes upon persons of every character
                                    and at all times and places. Persons who would curse the jerks, would get them most
                                    violently, sometimes at worship and sometimes in the field at work. They made their
                                    first appearance in the year 1800 in <placeName>

                                    phenomenon is has been a matter of dispute. It sems to me to have been one of those
                                    demonical possessions which were so numerous in the days of the Savior and we are
                                    nowhere assured that they were entirely confined to that age but have reasons to
                                    believe that they still exist and not in small numbers.</p>

                                    Catholic population is by no means proportionate to the formidable machinery of
                                    literary, theological and monastic institutions here exhibite[d]. All this array of
                                    colleges, seminaries, convents and nunneries is for the sake of <hi rend="i">proselyting.</hi> Upon the rising generation they have fixed their eyes and
                                    centred their projects and plans. This should induce Protestants to open schools
                                    themselves in which their children could be educated without becoming contaminated
                                    with the deleterious errors of papacy.</p>
                        <p>I have nothing more to communicate which would be of interest or of advantage to you.
                                    I would merely state, at the close of this series of letters to you, that in the
                                    West there is a large field of morals to be cultivated and improved. This field can
                                    and must be operated upon by two classes of persons in the ministry. There must be
                                    some who will enter into this field, who must take up their residence within its
                                    confines and operate directly upon it. But another class who do not live in the
                                    boundaries of this field. But still can do much to cultivate it. Those of you whose
                                    lot it is not to locate in the far West, can do much for this part of our land. You
                                    can do much with earnest prayers; for the prayer of the righteous man, when fervent,
                                    is effectual and availeth much. You can also do much by inducing young men to
                                    prepare themselves to preach the gospel. The want of laborers is the great
                                    hindrance. If there were only faithful laborers there would be wages; the Lord would
                                    give them souls for their hire and bread for their sustenance and garments for their
                                    clothing. There would be no lack of these things. I dont think there is enough
                                    fervent prayer and travail of souls on this subject among our ministers and people.
                                    I would also remark that those of you who wish to missionate or locate in this part
                                    of the land must expect to suffer some privations and hardships. You must suffer the
                                    taunts of mockers and the inveterate suspicions of good people who have been imposed
                                    on and deceived by wicked men. You [mu]st be contented with many things which [in]
                                    the East would be considered discomforts. [I] have seen ministers living with a
                                    consider[ab]le family in a cabin 15 feet by 20, the whole [in] one apartment. This
                                    was their kitchen, [th]eir parlor, their dining-room and their stu[dy]. Men, women
                                    and children lodge in one [ap]artment. But these things are easily <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-071-1-088"/> borne [w]hen the soul is full of love to God and to
                                    [im]mortal souls. I would once more caution [yo]u not to be deceived in the vain
                                    thought [th]at in the West, inferior ministerial qualifica[ti]ons are unnecessary to
                                    be useful. Those of [y]ou who wish to make the West your sphere [of] labor should be
                                    most diligent to get a large [st?]ock of information and much mental discip[li]ne.
                                    The latter is particularly necessary as, [it] will give facility in studying human
                                    nature. [A]n intimate and critical acquaintance with [t]he Bible is also absolutely
                                    necessary. In [a]ddition to these and above all these, deep [to]ned, ardent piety is
                                    everywhere necessary [f]or a man to be successful in the ministry and [p]articularly
                                    in the West. May the Lord who [c]alled us to the work, qualify us well for it [?] no
                                    make us strong in the power of his right [to] pull down the strong holds of satan
                                    and in[iq]uity and to save many immortal souls from [si]n and ruin.</p>

            <head>Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation for Contributions to Indiana History,
                    1945–1974</head>
            <p>Since 1945 the American Association for State and Local History has annually given Awards of Merit
                    and Certificates of Commendation to individuals, companies, and organizations for their
                    contributions to state and local history. (For an explanation of the current basis for these awards
                    and certificates, see the announcement regarding them for 1975 on page 88 of this issue.)</p>
            <p>The roster which follows is an attempt to list all awards and certificates which have been granted
                    since 1945 for contributions to Indiana history. Though based on information received from the
                    Awards Liaison Office of the American Association for State and Local History, the listing is
                    probably incomplete, and it may contain errors. The editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> would much appreciate information about apparent omissions or possible errors.</p>
            <p>The cumulative listing for 1945–1973 indicates only the names and addresses of persons,
                    companies, and organizations which have received either awards or certificates. In most instances
                    citations indicating the basis for the recognition extended are lacking, incomplete, or uncertain as
                    to their accuracy; hence, none are given. The listing for 1974, however, includes the explanatory
                    citation. For subsequent years, either annually or at intervals, the editor plans to add new
                    listings in the same manner as for 1974.</p>
            <p>Publication of this roster should serve several purposes. First of all, it gives additional
                    recognition to persons, companies, and organizations who have received awards or certificates for
                    their contributions to Indiana history. Second, it is hoped that it will stimulate increased efforts
                    on the part <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-071-1-090"/> of individuals and groups to merit such recognition.
                    Third, it serves as a guide to the kinds of contributions which are expected from persons,
                    companies, and organizations which are considered for awards and certificates. Fourth, it calls
                    attention to one of the varied and important contributions which the American Association for State
                    and Local History makes to historical study throughout the <placeName>

                    </placeName> as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgement by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."</p>

            <p>This volume supplements Richard E. Banta's compilation of <hi rend="i">Indiana Authors and
                        their Books, 1816–1916</hi>, and includes some names omitted from the earlier period.
                    It follows the pattern established for the original volume, excluding textbooks, genealogies,
                    laboratory manuals, spellers, pamphlets of less than twenty-four pages, articles in periodicals and
                    serials, and "state or federal publications and addresses, unless the latter were obviously
                    intended principally for publication" (p. ix). An author was considered eligible for
                    inclusion if he or she was born in Indiana or had lived half of his or her life in the state. Since
                    this is a fifty year supplement, the authors had to have had at least one book published by 1966.</p>
            <p>The names of the authors are arranged alphabetically followed by the date of birth and death, if
                    deceased, and by a biographical sketch. Included also is a bibliography of the author's
                    published works arranged by place and date of publication. In Banta's volume 950 Indiana
                    authors were listed, and in Thompson's volume there are 2,751.</p>
            <p>In a study made by John Moriarty on the best selling novels between 1895 and 1945, Moriarty devised a
                    point system to determine which state had been most productive in this field. Only <placeName>

                    </placeName> state with 218 points surpassed Indiana with 213 points. Banta followed the same system
                    for the best sellers between 1895 and 1965. In the fiction category <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state was first again with 460 points and Indiana was second with 288 points. In
                    non-fiction Indiana was in eighth place, but when both categories were combined, Indiana remained in
                    second place.</p>

            <p>Ralph Olmsted has written the first complete history of the second largest private institution of
                    higher education in Indiana. The Methodist school operated in the small southeastern Indiana town of
                        <geogName>Moores Hill</geogName> until World War I, and its only previous published history
                    (John W. Winkley, <hi rend="i">Moores Hill College: An Intimate History</hi>, 1954) included just
                    these pre-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> years. The present volume is only a modest improvement over the Winkley book in
                    describing the <geogName>Moores Hill</geogName> years; its major contribution is its discussion of
                    the heretofore unrecorded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> period. The author nowhere clearly states the audience for whom he has written the
                    book; however, internal evidence suggests that he is addressing primarily—although not
                    exclusively—the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> College "in group" (students, alumni, faculty, Indiana Methodists,
                    and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> residents).</p>
            <p>The book reflects the author's experience with the school. His four undergraduate years
                    coincided with the college's first four years in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and he has spent most of his adult years as business manager at the school.
                    Olmsted's narrative for the years after he arrived at the college is more dynamic than it
                    is for the earlier period. Also, as an administrator, he has emphasized the organization and
                    management of the school more than the learning processes.</p>
            <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-071-1-096"/>
            <p>In many ways this volume reminds one of a college yearbook. Its physical dimensions are large; it is
                    lavishly illustrated (368 pictures); it was privately printed; it contains almost no footnotes (most
                    of the twenty-three footnotes are explanatory in nature); its prose is informal; it mentions a very
                    large number of people (including, for example, the successive chairmen of the Library Committee);
                    it gives much space to trivia (for example, "three American elms planted on the front
                    campus in 1922 died in 1969 and 1970," p. 248) and little space to describing the long
                    range goals and the evolving distinctive characteristics of the college.</p>
            <p>The major weakness of the book is its organization. Olmsted's unsatisfactory mix of topical
                    and chronological chapters results in duplication and fragmentation. Some of the chapters are too
                    short (2–4 pages); some of the chapter titles are imprecise ("Rough Diamond
                    Polished"); and some are misleading (the chapter on "Students" describes
                    only extracurricular activities). Also, many of the illustrations do not correlate with the
                    narrative of the pages on which they appear.</p>
            <p>The best parts of the book are the descriptions of the unique events in the college's
                    history: the move from <geogName>Moores Hill</geogName> to save the institution from demise; the
                    enthusiastic promotional efforts of leading <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens—including Mayor Benjamin Bosse—to bring the school to
                    their city; the competition with DePauw University for the financial support of the Indiana
                    Methodists; the vocational pursuits and achievements of the alumni, including Vance Hartke and Frank
                    Milhous, the maternal grandfather of Richard Nixon; the contribution of benefactors such as Andrew
                    Carnegie and Mrs. Robert Lansing; the seriously debated proposals to merge the school with DePauw or
                    to convert it into a junior college, a municipal college, or a branch of Indiana University; and the
                    evolvement from being a small (400–500 students), largely commuter college before World
                    War II to being one of the largest Methodist institutions of higher education in the country by the
                    late 1960s.</p>
            <p>For many years the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                    </placeName> brewing industry attempts to demonstrate how one urban industrial enterprise can
                    influence the economic life, institutional development, and "tone" of a city.
                    Beginning with the establishment of the first brewery in 1812, Downard carries his narrative through
                    the growth decades of the 1870s and 1880s to prohibition and concludes with the revival of the
                    industry after 1933. Special attention is given to the influence of German immigrants on brewing
                    after 1840, the changing organizational structure of the industry, the impact of such technological
                    developments as pasteurization and refrigeration, the workers' attempts to unionize and the
                    brewers' responses, and common business practices designed to limit competition from

            <p>Histories of this type are frequently less significant than they should be because authors fail to
                    place their studies in a broad perspective. Although this is not a major weakness in
                    Downard's study, it does cause some problems. Downard does not always successfully relate
                    his study to the general economic development of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. With the exception of the first chapter few references are made to other industrial
                    enterprises in the city. Perhaps it is too much to expect in a history of one industry, but
                    seemingly some general comments on the nature of industrialization in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and some comparative statistics for such factors as capital investments, gross output,
                    marketing practices, size of labor force, and the number of competing firms within each major
                    industrial group would contribute to a better understanding of the economic importance of brewing in
                    the city. This is particularly true for periods of growth and retrenchment.</p>
            <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-071-1-098"/>
            <p>Downard is generally very careful, however, to relate the growth of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> breweries to the development of the industry nationally, particularly in his analysis
                    of marketing procedures, volume of production, and unionization. By concentrating on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where brewers produced primarily for the local market, he is able to draw some
                    interesting comparisons with brewers in other cities (Milwaukee and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example) who competed mainly in the national market. These discussions are well
                    balanced and contribute significantly to the general history of the brewing industry.</p>
            <p>Downard's handling of the social-cultural impact of the industry is also excellent. He
                    discusses in detail the role of brewery owners in social and philanthropic activities, the cultural
                    contributions of the German population, and the influence of the Over-the-Rhine district and the
                    hilltop resorts (with their beer gardens, saloons, and entertainment) on the character of the city.
                    Downard concludes that the importance of beer and breweries in the social life of the community
                    peaked in the 1890s and declined significantly thereafter because of suburbanization and pressure
                    from the Sabbatarians to enforce Sunday closing laws. This analysis clearly demonstrates the
                    intricate relationships between economic activities and the cultural development in an urban
                    setting.</p>
            <p>The book is well written and carefully documented. It makes a significant contribution in the field
                    of urban history as well as the history of economic institutions. It will particularly appeal to

                    state elections of November, 1905. In that election—one of the
                    "rowdiest" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> history—the Democrats managed to overcome their Republican-Fusionist
                    challengers, but only, as a state court later observed, by sounding "every note on the
                    gamut of election crimes" (p. 89). "It appeared," Professor Clark writes,
                    "that the Democratic machine had thought up about every device possible for stealing the
                    election at the polls in the less reputable precincts in <placeName>

                    prostitute the objectives of the democratic process" (p. 41). An indignant group of
                    business and professional men organized a protest movement that eventually succeeded in reversing
                    the election results in the <placeName>

            <p>This citizens' uprising or "reform" movement and its chief of counsel in
                    the long legal battle between 1905 and 1907 provide the focus for Clark's interesting
                    little volume. Helm Bruce was a respectable <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> lawyer, a descendant of pioneer <placeName>

                    </placeName> forebears, and a man who somehow managed to oppose the state's three sacred
                    institutions of tobacco, horse racing, and whiskey distilling. Although Clark sketches
                    Bruce's career and describes his legal arguments in the citizens' case against the
                    Whallen machine, he has written neither a biography of Bruce nor an account of the reform movement
                    in which the lawyer participated, though he throws light on both. Instead, he has written an essay
                    on the historical background and the urban context that produced the heated political struggle of
                    1905. Not surprisingly, the work bears the mark of Clark's unsurpassed knowledge of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> history and his deep understanding of its people and culture.</p>
            <p>The book is not documented, except for a short bibliography, but it is obviously based on extensive
                    research in newspapers and court records. More careful proofreading would have eliminated a number
                    of typographical and spelling errors, but the author has written a useful introduction to a

                    city's political culture, including a book on bossism and reform during the progressive
                    era.</p>

                    "finds" of the last twenty-one years that they reveal those long sought
                    "real purposes" and dispel the reticence and secrecy.</p>
            <p>As President Gerald R. Ford seeks every opportunity to dust off Lincoln portraits and sit under them
                    for photographs and as television warms up for the Revolution's bicentennial with a series
                    of specials on the only president who quashed an American revolution, one is reminded that the
                    efforts to understand Lincoln must go on. Roy P. Basler has spent his life trying to aid that
                    effort. His edition of <hi rend="i">The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</hi> (8 vols., 1953) is
                    the basis of all current Lincoln scholarship, and it is the rarest of occasions when a historian
                    questions Basler's judgment in dating or verifying a Lincoln text.</p>

                    seems overly preoccupied with Yankee inventions only because this volume publishes the letters

                    (1956). He seems extraordinarily consumed with the "same everlasting

            <p>Read as it should be, the <hi rend="i">Supplement</hi> fills in gaps in the previous eight volumes
                    and solves a few problems. The more perplexing ones remain. Was Lincoln, for example, a humanitarian
                    liberal who risked the nation's existence for the black man's freedom, or was he
                    Edmund Wilson's prophet of the Union as religious mysticism, an ambitious frontier Carlyle
                    who admired the hero in history? Basler features as his frontispiece a remarkable letter to Charles
                    Sumner filled with humanitarianism and concern for legality: "The bearer of this is the
                    widow of Major Booth, who fell at Fort-Pillow. She makes a point, which I think very worthy of
                    consideration which is, widows and children <hi rend="i">in fact</hi>, of colored soldiers who fall
                    in our service, be placed in law, the same as if their marriages were legal, so that they can have
                    the benefit of the provisions made the widows &amp; orphans of white soldiers" (p.
                    243). Present also is Lincoln's thank you note to Charles Janeway Stillé, whose
                    pamphlet <hi rend="i">How a Free People Conduct a Long War</hi> Lincoln found "the best
                    production upon the subject it treats which I have seen" (p. 171) and which George M.
                    Fredrickson finds remarkable for its admiration of monarchy and its worship of force! Puzzles
                    remain, but the road to understanding begins with Basler's masterful editions of
                    Lincoln's works.</p>

            <p>Whenever one undertakes a study of the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army, the aspect most difficult to cover, in many ways, has been the Indian wars during
                    the thirty-five years after the Civil War. A great amount of material has been available, but
                    accounts have tended to be one sided, incomplete, incorrect, and biased. It has seemed that many of
                    those who have set out to write about the army and the <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-071-1-102"/> Indian
                    have done so as a matter of special pleading to establish or rehabilitate some reputations while
                    destroying others, to justify or to attack some policy, or to develop some preconceived lesson.
                    Robert M. Utley has taken a major step to fill that gap. We now have a chronicle and an analysis of
                    the Indian wars to equal those of the other major operations of the army.</p>
            <p>Beginning with a clear explanation of the army's administrative, territorial, and tactical
                    organization as well as a description of its arms, uniforms, and equipment, the book sets a proper
                    stage for the narrative of action in the West. Here, unlike too many military histories, the reader
                    is kept aware throughout of the problems of supply and transportation in mounting and sustaining
                    campaigns over the vast distances of the Great Plains and the western mountains. In the account of
                    the conquest of the Sioux, 1876–1881, this recurring theme is noted thus: "But
                    once again the campaign demonstrated truths that so often eluded the frontier generals: heavy
                    conventional columns rarely succeeded against the unconventional foe; the logistical requirements of
                    provisioning so many men and horses so far from their bases usually turned such operations into
                    exercises in self-preservation" (p. 271).</p>
            <p>All of the well known, old tales are retold with a detachment, an attention to detail, and a clarity
                    which provides new understanding and perspective, and scores of lesser known campaigns and battles
                    receive the same careful treatment. Undoubtedly some readers will immediately look for the account
                    of "Ouster's Last Stand." Appropriately this comes not under that title
                    but in the chapter called "Sitting Bull." The battle comes out the same way, but
                    the explanation is clearer and rings truer than in many longer volumes on the subject.</p>
            <p>To an extent Utley joins the line of critics of Congress, such as Emory Upton and Frederic L.
                    Huidekoper, for the military unpreparedness of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. But his is a more solid position, for his criticism is in terms of the actual
                    requirements of the frontier, not in terms of the potential of a war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> or an attack by a major European power. Consciously avoiding the stereotypes of
                    nobleness or savagery on either side, Utley gives the most balanced and probably <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-071-1-103"/> the best general survey of the Indian Wars that one is likely to find.
                    He concludes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Thus the frontier army was not, as many of its leaders saw it, the heroic vanguard of
                            civilization, crushing the savages and opening the West to settlers. Still less was it the
                            barbaric band of butchers, eternally waging unjust war against unoffending Indians, that is
                            depicted in the humanitarian literature of the nineteenth century and the atonement
                            literature of the twentieth. Rather, the frontier army was a conventional military force
                            trying to control, by conventional military methods, a people that did not behave like a
                            conventional enemy at all. … In the process they wrote a dramatic and stirring
                            chapter of American history, one that need not be diminished by today's recognition
                            of the monstrous wrong it inflicted on the Indian (p. 411).</p>

            <p>The writing and publishing of state history has been regarded as a parochial pursuit by many
                    historians and as a precarious venture by many publishers. The teaching of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> history is hardly flourishing though it is found in many elementary schools and
                    occasionally in high schools. Most of the colleges and universities in <placeName>

                    </placeName> history. Consequently, it is not surprising that an earlier manuscript on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> lay on one author's desk for over a decade, finally being published in a state
                    history series in 1940. During <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s centennial year (1948) the Milwaukee <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> published a
                    popular history of the state which has been reissued several times. Nesbit's present volume
                    is the most recent, the most complete, and the most mature in <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-071-1-104"/>
                    its scholarship of the three or four volumes now extant, and it is likely to stand for a long time.</p>
            <p>Professor Nesbit, who teaches history at the University of <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s past, places it in the Great Lakes geographic province, and writes it into
                    the nation's history. If more historians could see state history as national history in
                    microcosm, as he does, the role of state and local history might prosper instead of being regarded
                    as irrelevant by many. In <hi rend="i">

                    groups—Germans, Norwegians, Irish, Poles—have influenced politics more than

                    </placeName> culture; the legend of the La Follettes as innovators has been overdone. The author
                    even raises his eyebrows about the claim that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> has been a unique state, or if it has, he feels that it more and more reflects national
                    norms rather than ethnic influences.</p>
            <p>The book is well written, and the language and style is informal and easy to read. It does not
                    attempt to deal with such topics as art, literature, or drama. Not even the Paul Bunyan legends or
                    the lore about the origin of "Badger" are discussed. The book pays little
                    attention to education, especially to higher education beyond the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus. Folklife, folkways, or folk beliefs that affected history receive scant
                    mention. There is a heavy orientation toward political affairs. Despite this, it is an imposing
                    volume, with hundreds of insights into the process of building the Badger State, and it has been
                    written without looking over the shoulder at any ethnic group, family, or friend who might think
                    differently. It is scholarly state history at its best.</p>

            <p>The central figure of this trilogy is a Lutheran pioneer missionary from Norway who, in August, 1844,
                    came to southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> to gather Norwegian immigrants into Lutheran congregations. J. W. C.
                    Dietrichson's eagerness to journey to America, Editor Nelson explains, "sprang
                    from the conviction that religious life among his countrymen in the New World was desolate, and that
                    the way to remedy the situation was to transfer as far as possible the Church of Norway to the woods
                    and prairies of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName>" (p. 21).</p>
            <p>Various factors combined to make that goal practically unattainable: Dietrichson's own
                    Grundtvigian theological background and impervious character, his lack of sympathy for the Haugean
                    lay religion approach of Elling Eielsen who was already at work among the immigrants, his lack of
                    real understanding of religious freedom in America, and his militant opposition to certain American
                    sects, particularly the Mormons. As a result, Dietrichson stayed in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> only six years, but during that time he did accomplish a great deal. He organized
                    several congregations (Koshkonong parish, southeast of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the Spring Prairie church, north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>); he introduced the Sunday School movement among Norwegian Americans; he founded a
                    reading society and a library; and he provided a model constitution for Norwegian Lutheran churches
                    (Spring Prairie's constitution). He also was intent on founding a Norwegian Lutheran synod.
                    Although this did not occur until 1853, Dietrichson did lay the groundwork.</p>
            <p>The book is a trilogy. The first part consists of a preface and a concise and well illustrated
                    introduction by Professor E. Clifford Nelson. In the preface Nelson relates how the book came into
                    being; in the introduction he sets the <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-071-1-106"/> nineteenth century
                    background against which the Norwegian immigrant is to be seen, provides a biography of Dietrichson,
                    and gives an assessment of Dietrichson's contribution to the immigrants' life in
                    the New World. The second part of the volume is Dietrichson's own <hi rend="i">Travel
                        Narrative</hi>, carefully edited and footnoted by Nelson after he obtained a recent English
                    translation from Malcolm Rosholt. The third part is the <hi rend="i">Koshkonong Parish Journal</hi>,
                    translated and edited by Professor Harris E. Kaasa.</p>
            <p>For the student of American church history, especially Lutheran church history, the book is very
                    valuable. One notes, for example, the limited contact between German and Norwegian immigrants in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> territory and state, the more authoritarian type church government of the Norwegians,
                    and the difficulty Dietrichson experienced in maintaining church discipline. It is revealing, too,
                    that Dietrichson continued to be a controversial figure in Norway and demitted the ministry in 1873
                    after being refused communion by the recently appointed neighboring pastor, the Reverend Adolf Carl
                    Preus, on the grounds that Dietrichson was "heterodox."</p>
            <p>The book also possesses more than passing interest for any serious student of social, intellectual,
                    and religious history of nineteenth century America. Dietrichson did have a sense of
                    history-in-the-making as he penned his <hi rend="i">Travel Narrative</hi> and carefully kept the <hi rend="i">Koshkonong Journal.</hi> The book demonstrates, too, what significant contributions to
                    historical writing are being made by the Norwegian-American Historical Association, which has
                    produced fifty-three volumes in its forty-eight years of activity. If there is a weakness in the
                    volume, it is the duplication of narrative and detail in the <hi rend="i">Travel Account</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="i">Parish Journal.</hi>
