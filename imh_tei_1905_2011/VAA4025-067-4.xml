            <byline>John T. Flanagan<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>In 1970 Jessamyn West published <hi rend="i">Crimson Ramblers of the World, Farewell,</hi> her ninth
                    work of fiction and her twelfth book.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Since 1945 when <hi rend="i">The Friendly
                        Persuasion</hi> appeared, she has written five books of short stories and four novels; and she
                    has contributed to such major American magazines as <hi rend="i">Harper's,</hi> the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly,</hi> the <hi rend="i">Yale Review,</hi> and the <hi rend="i">New
                        Yorker,</hi> not to mention such defunct periodicals as <hi rend="i">Collier's</hi> and
                    the weekly <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post.</hi> One volume, <hi rend="i">Cress Delahanty,</hi>
                    was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1954. Yet she has never won a Pulitzer Prize nor has her
                    work attracted substantial critical attention. Her depiction of adolescent girls, her low keyed
                    plots, her occasional preference for historical themes, and perhaps even the quiet authority of her
                    writing have deflected critics who are basically concerned with splashy techniques and perhaps the
                    more immediate social and economic problems of the day. One is reminded of Edwin Arlington
                    Robinson's reply to the stricture that his work consisted mostly of blacks and browns and
                    grays. "Those are pretty fast colors," he insisted.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It is
                    likely that Miss West's work will reveal a durability not enjoyed by the more sensational
                    and iconoclastic writers of her time.</p>
            <p>Much of what Jessamyn West has written suggests her <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> heritage. Not only do practicing members of the Society of Friends frequently appear as
                    characters, but such stalwart <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> virtues as sobriety, tolerance, industry, thrift, and integrity seem to be the criteria
                    by which she judges and conceives people. She has found models for some of her characters within her
                    own family. Thus Joshua and Elizabeth Milhous, great-grandparents not only of Miss West but also of
                    President Richard Milhous Nixon, are the prototypes of two of her most memorable individuals, Jess
                    and Eliza Birdwell. Moreover, Miss West's life has been closely linked with two
                    states–Indiana and <placeName>

                            between his family and Indiana. On June 24, 1971, he made a special trip to Vernon in order
                            to dedicate a plaque commemorating the birthplace of his mother, Hannah Milhous Nixon. Mrs.
                            Nixon was born on a farm in 1885 four and one half miles southeast of Butlerville in Bigger

            <p>In the early 1940s Miss West began to contribute short stories to such periodicals as the <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly;</hi> and a collection of them loosely spliced into a longer
                    narrative, <hi rend="i">The Friendly Persuasion,</hi> became an immediate success. Miss West later
                    spent some months on location in Hollywood helping to convert the book into a motion picture. When

            <p>Geographically Miss West's fiction is divided somewhat inequitably between the two states

                            William Wyler, was released by Allied Artists Pictures Corporation in 1956. Michael Wilson
                            was originally engaged to write the screen play but subsequently Robert Wyler and Miss West
                            herself were called to Hollywood for the purpose. Because of the tangle of authorship no
                            credit was given to any scriptwriter when the picture was first shown. Miss West wrote her
                            version of what happened during her Hollywood sojourn in the subjective and impressionistic

                    <hi rend="i">World, Farewell.</hi> Chronologically a similar division is apparent. The four Indiana
                    volumes are all set in the nineteenth century although it is true that <hi rend="i">The Witch
                        Diggers</hi> (1951) begins on Christmas Day, 1899, and spills over into the following year. The
                    other three Indiana books take place in pre-Civil War days and are localized in the southeastern
                    section of the state in which <placeName>

                    </placeName> novels are twentieth century narratives. Miss West's longest and most
                    ambitious novel, <hi rend="i">South of the Angels</hi> (1960), is a panoramic account of the
                    subdividing and settlement of a tract of land located in the neighborhood of Anaheim. The
                    transformation of the rolling barley fields into citrus groves, a story repeated more than once in
                    the historical development of Orange County, is as authentic history as Miss West's account

            </p>
            <p>A good deal of Miss West's fiction has appeared in magazines, and some of the earlier
                    stories remain uncollected. Her habit has been to select sufficient stories or sketches and to
                    arrange them in chronological order to form such books as <hi rend="i">Cress Delahanty</hi> and <hi rend="i">Except for Me and Thee.</hi> Despite the absence of transitions from story to story the
                    reappearance of the protagonists and even of some of the minor characters provides a superficial
                    coherence which can substitute, at times quite effectively, for genuine plot development. But rarely
                    is there a strong dramatic interest, or a narrative which gradually evolves and develops in
                    intensity until a climax is reached. Even where the author from the outset apparently conceived of
                    her story as a structural whole rather than as a grouping of disjunctive episodes, her habit of
                    concentrating on scenes and sketches contravenes artistic unity. Indeed one might argue that her
                    major limitation as a novelist is her lack of firm structure.</p>
            <p>There are, to be sure, several books in which Miss West clearly wrestled with the problem of
                    structure. In <hi rend="i">A Matter of Time,</hi> a chronicle of the Murphy family, it is the
                    relationship between the sisters Tasmania and Blix which provides the backbone of the novel. The
                    Murphy family is presented in fragmentary episodes. Orland Murphy, originally from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, is inept and somewhat of a tinkerer; his wife Maude strives to hold the family
                    together but is neither sharply aware of nor sympathetic with the world around her. The Christmas
                    reunion of the children is convivial, but in this <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> Quakerish household there is no Christmas tree, no crib, no churchgoing. Both <list type="footnotes">

                    sensual and the more impulsive, Tassie (short for Tasmania) the more intellectual. Blix'
                    ailment, a malignant intestinal tumor, draws the sisters together, and much of the novel focuses on
                    Blix' sick bed with Tassie alternately ministering to the wants of her dying sister and
                    recalling past experiences. Eventually a plan develops: when Blix reaches the point of being unable
                    or unwilling to endure further pain, she will kill herself with an overdose of pills which her
                    physician has conveniently provided. Thus <hi rend="i">A Matter of Time</hi> does build up to a
                    conclusion and stops abruptly with Blix' death.</p>
            <p>In <hi rend="i">South of the Angels,</hi> a sprawling novel of 564 pages, Miss West has provided a
                    huge cast, so numerous indeed that one reviewer suggested that a reader would benefit from a list of
                    dramatis personae.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> In all some seventeen fairly important characters are
                    introduced, described, interwoven with the events of the novel. But the artistic method of shifting
                    back and forth among them leaves the reader puzzled to the end as to which figure is meant to be the
                    protagonist. The technique utilized here is reminiscent of John Dos Passos' <hi rend="i">U.S.A.</hi> trilogy in the days when such labels as the breadthwise novel were employed.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Thus the story opens with the introduction of Syl Perkins and his wife, Syl
                    being the promoter of a land scheme which will attract immigrants and produce citrus crops providing
                    that adequate water is available. But after the first section of chapter one Perkins vanishes for
                    almost a hundred pages and he seldom reappears thereafter. In the meanwhile the stage is filled with
                    others: Tom Mount, carpenter and itinerant lecher; the Mexican couple Pete and Rosa; the Shel Lewis
                    family; Basil Cudlip, inveterate hater of Negroes and Mexicans and paradigm of the Old South; Lute
                    Cope, newspaper editor, and his somewhat less than faithful wife, Indiana Rose Cope; Asa Brice,
                    described in Thoreau-like terms but not endowed with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry</region>
                    </placeName> David Thoreau's intellectuality; the widow Opal Tetford and the spinster
                    schoolteacher Eunice Fry, both seduced and jilted by Tom Mount; the old line Quakers Wendlin and
                    Mary Jessup; the self-named preacher LeRoy Raunce, who yields to the demands of the flesh more than
                    a <placeName>

                    </placeName> should; and of course the younger people, Medora Cudlip, Press Cope, Chad Lewis. Almost
                    anyone of these persons could have served the author as a central character; instead the narrative
                    moves from one to another, from episode to episode, without sequence or apparent direction, save
                    that the absence of water works <list type="footnotes">

                    young rural schoolmaster, and they begin married life in the <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName>
                    of southeastern Indiana. Reno is even less successful as a farmer than as a rural pedagogue; he
                    raises hogs on rented land and dreams of prosperity; but, when he falls sick, it is Leafy who takes
                    command and sees that the hogs reach the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> market. En route to the meat packing center Leafy falls in with an attractive young
                    drover Cashie Wade, accepts his hospitality, and sleeps with him in his peripatetic hog hospital.
                    Pregnant as a result of this liaison Leafy returns to the Converse home in <placeName>

                    inept obstetrician who virtually flees from the sickroom, Leafy gives birth to a healthy girl. Thus

                    "King William was King James' son, Up from the royal race did come"
                    before dancing stops and banana ice cream and coconut cake appear.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> A quite
                    different scene, more comic than most of Miss West's, shows Cress Delahanty, having
                    badgered her father into allowing her to purchase an extravagant hat for beach wear, parading up and
                    down a <placeName>

                    precious hat slowly settling into the water, which quickly turns a flamingo red from the dye in the
                    hat's ornaments. The crowning humiliation to Cress is the insistence of the proprietor of
                    the aquarium that Mr. Delahanty pay for the fish which Cress' hat has supposedly
                    poisoned."</p>
            <p>Part of Miss West's success in realizing such scenes derives from her control of the
                    physical locale and her use of authentic and specific colors and objects. The forests of early
                    Indiana are not just collections of trees but are full of sycamores and gums, of willows and
                    beeches. The underbrush includes sarviceberries and shadbush, fox <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The characters of Miss West's fiction form a diversified and well defined group with some
                    basic similarities.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> In the novels about early Indiana they are of necessity
                    rural and are often pioneer settlers. Towns play a small role since the interest is concentrated on
                    the farm home, occasional barn raisings or quilting bees, the camp meeting, the country school, the
                    tasks of field or kitchen. Indeed the reader is often reminded of the genre pictures in such novels
                    of Edward Eggleston as <hi rend="i">The Hoosier Schoolmaster</hi> (1871) and <hi rend="i">Roxy</hi>
                    (1878). Miss West's Hoosiers are farmers or nurserymen, stock raisers, rural pedagogues or
                    physicians, itinerant peddlers, exhorters or backwoods preachers. Jess Birdwell in <hi rend="i">The
                        Friendly Persvnsion</hi> peddles nursery stock throughout southern Indiana; Odis Korby in <hi rend="i">The Witch Diggers</hi> is an undertaker, furniture salesman, and feed merchant; Link
                    Con-boy in the same book is a country lawyer who took over the poor farm in the hope that he could
                    support his family more comfortably; Simon Yanders in <hi rend="i">

                    no substantial change. Citrus ranches, which produce oranges and lemons, substitute for the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> homesteads where corn and hogs and fruit trees are raised. The
                    subsistence farmer is still common although he is not so labeled; the log cabin or unpainted frame
                    dwelling has been replaced by the ranch house; the children find school a location for peripheral

                    events; the women attend PTA meetings and supervise bake sales and raffles. Instead of backwoods
                    hired hands there are itinerant fruit pickers, largely Mexicans, and oil drillers, textbook
                    salesmen, seaside resort fry cooks, fish peddlers, and piano tuners. Occasional scenes take place in
                    small towns and there are references to restaurants, high schools, movie houses, and town halls
                    placed conveniently over hardware stores or funeral establishments. But Miss West is not interested
                    in the sophistication, or the crime and violence, of the big city. Only a few characters in <hi rend="i">South of the Angels</hi> and <hi rend="i">A Matter of Time</hi> ever get to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>

                    </placeName> metropolis to their homes. The author's focus of concern remains the country,
                    no longer the lush forests of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>, where the big butts scarcely
                    allow the sunlight to filter to the forest floor, but rather arroyos and brown hills and desert land
                    parched for much of the year until a wind from the sierras brings coolness and flowers
                    simultaneously.</p>
            <p>It must be admitted that Miss West is not always successful or convincing in her depiction of male
                    characters. The husbands in <hi rend="i">A Matter of Time</hi> are vague background figures who
                    barely impinge on the reader's attention, even as Orland Murphy seems the most incompetent
                    and abstracted member of his family. <geogName>Reno Rivers</geogName> is inept and vacillating; his
                    attraction for Leafy can be explained only on the grounds that there was no available rival for a
                    young girl determined to leave home. Christie Fraser, the putative hero of <hi rend="i">The Witch
                        Diggers,</hi> seems uncertain and evasive when direct action is called for and is even allowed
                    to drop out of the story for several long chapters. Tom Mount in <hi rend="i">South of the
                    Angels</hi> is the conventional philanderer and woman chaser; he has only to look at a female to
                    insure a conquest. Cress Delahanty's father is oddly tolerant and protective even when his
                    adolescent and quirky daughter goes from one strange kick to another.</p>
            <p>Some of the men in <hi rend="i">South of the Angels,</hi> to be sure, have stronger outlines. The
                    real estate promoter Syl Perkins is an amiable shyster whom Miss West makes an error in not
                    developing further. Lute Cope, despite being imposed upon by both his daughter and his wife, has a
                    certain individuality which also might have been given further exposition. Basil Cudlip's
                    willingness to take the law into his own hands, especially if his prospective victim is dark
                    skinned, suggests that the mentality of the Old South can be transferred all too easily to southern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. And LeRoy Raunce, a combination of artisan and self-taught preacher, is a figure
                    relatively well known in the vast amorphous region south of the angels.</p>
            <pb n="309" id="VAA4025-067-4-011"/>
            <p>As one might expect, Miss West's best drawn men are the Quakers, whose firm virtues she can
                    sincerely admire and whose peccadilloes and gentle stubbornness she can review with smiling
                    tolerance. Wendlin Jessup, helplessly watching his wife battle futilely against death, is admirably
                    calm and self-controlled. His son Benjamin will certainly do credit to the Society of Friends which
                    he hopes to serve. Bass Converse, surprisingly unyielding in his role of local despot even in
                    pioneer <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    decoration that Christmas brings to the homes of his neighbors, but on many occasions fumbles with a
                    French harp. He will play camp meeting hymns without conviction.</p>
            <p>Above all there is Jess Birdwell, the hero of two books or, more properly, of a number of loosely
                    connected short stories. Born in <placeName>

                    in helping fugitive slaves and avoiding difficulties with the authorities. But Jess is not
                    completely a paragon of virtue. He cannot disguise his innate love of music and insists on placing
                    an organ in the attic of his house. Nor can he ever overcome his love for fast horses. He takes
                    considerable satisfaction in being able to drive a <placeName>

                    exhorter. Lib Conboy, mistress of the county poor farm, is by turns a slattern and an actress; she
                    strives to run the home and also to control her family but is wholly successful in neither attempt.
                    Tassie Murphy, by turns confidante and nurse to her younger sister Blix, is more introspective and
                    analytical than most of Miss West's women. She is the voice of the family as well as the
                    narrator of the story. She also shares the bookish interests of the author, and her choice of
                    reading–the Bronte sisters, Elinor Wylie, T. E. Shaw, E. E. Cummings, F. Scott
                    Fitzgerald–is probably to some extent Miss West's. Although she is a
                    professional librarian rather than a writer, Tassie's literary interests distinguish her
                    further from the other fictional women. Eunice Fry, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="cou">Colorado</country>
                    </placeName> schoolteacher who desperately wants a man, is naive in her conviction that she is the
                    only woman approached by Tom Mount and more than a little reckless in her quick surrender to him.
                    Subsequently her mixed devotion and resentment lead her to ambivalent actions which in the
                    circumstances do not seem unexpected.</p>
            <p>Miss West's most engaging portraits, however, are the adolescent girls, the young women
                    reaching out for emotional and economic security, whose lives are strange juxtapositions of
                    embarrassment, humiliation, surprise, and minor triumph. <geogName>Leafy Rivers</geogName>, Cress
                    Delahanty, Emma and Cate Conboy are plausible and vibrant individuals, facing life with curiosity
                    and eagerness, determined to establish their identities and to share the experiences of maturity.</p>
            <p>
               <geogName>Leafy Rivers</geogName>' life is shown in retrospect since she is expecting her
                    first child, and a series of flashbacks reviews her past years. But her adolescent days at home, her
                    sessions in the country school where she first met and admired Reno, social gatherings and
                    festivities, the trek to the Indiana backwoods, her life in the forest cabin until she single

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, these are realized clearly and specifically. At the end of her chronicle Leafy emerges
                    as a young woman who knows her own mind and is determined, in Hoosier parlance, to "get
                    shut of" her nickname. As Edward Weeks points out, there can be "no doubt of the

            <p>Cress Delahanty, on the other hand, is younger and more girlish. She is presented as growing from

                    too vigorous effort to shield him from injury. Later she becomes his rival in memorizing lines from
                    Virgil in a school Latin play and buys the fantastic beach hat which had such a deplorable end.
                    Above everything else Cress wants to be an individual with a glamorous personality. Honesty and
                    kindness and cheerfulness she admits to be desirable traits but denies that they have much utility
                    in becoming popular, so she decides to be known as crazy. And when wearing bedroom slippers and
                    carrying her shoes in her hand she rushes out of the house to meet the school bus, claiming that in
                    this way she can save a few minutes of valuable time, her act begins a reputation for eccentricity.
                    Cress is superstitious and naive. She counts white horses, tea leaves, bridges, mules, and one eyed
                    cars. She becomes aware of signs and portents. A pointed elbow denotes a sour disposition, a
                    sweating glass prophesies rain, if you laugh before breakfast you will certainly cry before dinner.
                    She copies beautiful lilting phrases from Shelley and dreams of boyish lovers although she manages
                    to convey to her parents the notion that she is not interested in the other sex. When her story ends
                    leaving her at sixteen, she is still immature and unaware of a liaison which an older female friend
                    is having immediately under her eyes.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>The Conboy sisters also reveal Miss West's admirable command of the psychology of
                    adolescence. Emma, going into her teens, is skinny, unattractive, and brash. To simulate the
                    appearance of hair although she has not reached puberty, she jabs burned matches into her arm pits.
                    She is intentionally candid and at times impertinent. Once she strips off her clothes before a
                    surprised male inhabitant of the poor farm so that he can view a female form rather than depending
                    on pictures of underwear cut out from mail order catalogues. Cate Conboy, eccentrically spelling her
                    name with a capital C, uses other means to attract attention. When Christie Fraser courts her, he
                    takes her on an excursion across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> to the far state of <placeName>

                    </placeName>; Cate considers this experience to be the height of sophistication. Marriage is all but
                    assured when Cate suddenly learns that her father Link Conboy has not been strictly faithful to her
                    mother in the past. This <list type="footnotes">

            <p>
               <geogName>Leafy Rivers</geogName>, Cress Delahanty, and Cate Conboy are not shown as dramatic figures
                    engaged in sensational actions. Rather the reader is interested in their day to day activities, in
                    their petty disappointments and desires. In terms of years their stories are short. But their
                    personalities are established by the author's careful selection of details and her
                    sympathetic understanding of their whims and frustrations. There is no adolescent boy in Miss
                    West's fiction who achieves equal distinction. But when she writes of the young girl
                    growing up in a domestic environment and first trying out her fledgling powers, she is on firm
                        ground.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>Miss West is equally successful in her command of language, the colloquial diction of the backwoods
                    and the farm as well as the use of striking analogies and similes. Much of this mastery is the
                    result of her Indiana heritage and her Scotch-Irish legacy. She once wrote of her grandmother:
                    "She was Irish and Hoosier before she was a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and she had picturesque ways of saying things: When she was warm she was
                    ‘hot as a little red wagon’; when she cleaned, she ‘cleaned like
                    fighting a fire.’ Disorder ‘made hell look like a lightning bug.’
                    When she died it was, to use her own words, ‘like the stopping of running
                        water.’"<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Family tradition preserved dialectal or

                    adjacent to the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> can testify from experience. Miss West never
                    deliberately studied the ordinary speech of an earlier period, as Conrad Richter pored over

                    surprising similes taken from ordinary life and observation. A creek is "as pliable and
                    sinuous as a fat summer snake." One of the inmates of the poor farm complains, "It
                    goes against my grain always seeing the squeaking wheel get the grease." <geogName>Leafy
                        Rivers</geogName>, riding two on a horse behind her brother and clinging to him, finds that
                    "His thin waist, beneath her hands, tingled like a pump handle when the water begins to
                    climb." On a fall day in the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> "Blue haze, like
                    ribbon through the eyelets of a bodice, was laced between the trees on the horizon." On the

                    hair, windblown, exposed a skin as white as that of any butcher-shop rabbit." In an Orange
                    County hamlet cicadas "were stitching their sewing-machine song." Tassie Murphy
                    observes that in Palm Springs "the exposed haunches of Midwestern matrons show, before the
                    leather is tanned, expanses of baby-bottom heat rash." Amid the extreme desert heat
                    "A few wispy mare's tails tarnished the blue metal sky." The Raunce cow,
                    tied to a stake in the backyard, was "surrounded by straw like a prospective
                    martyr." Ellen Lewis wandering toward her brother's tent at night finds that the
                    sky "was pricked like a colander with stars." The rag carpet in a desert house was
                    difficult to keep anchored down but "was filled with rolling swells, like a pot of
                    corn-meal mush coming to a boil." Lute Cope, puzzling about his wife's behavior,
                    remembers that some women take their sex like men, "threshing around like beached catfish,
                    unable to live or die." Outside the Raunce house on the tract there were "blue
                    four-o'clocks trained up cord strings at one end of the porch like notes on a
                        zither."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

                    express his attitude or his philosophy, and the maxim is more revealing than several sentences of
                    dialogue. Shel Lewis, depressed by his own experience in trying to better himself, concludes that he
                    was the man caught in the proverbial dilemma, between the devil and the deep blue sea. The Raunce
                    household was unpredictable, certainly not a dwelling where there was a place for everything and
                    everything in its place. Basil Cudlip, the biased southerner, doesn't like mulattoes; to
                    him Negroes should be the real article, all wool and a yard wide. A farmer planting corn remembers
                    the old adage, "Three to grow and one for the crow." Jess Birdwell is happily
                    married and a faithful husband but he has his passions, and one of them, "not to beat the
                    Devil around the bush, [is for] fast horseflesh." A self-reliant man, he believes that
                    "The Lord helps those who help themselves." Jess is also aware of weather signs
                    and seasonal changes which he expresses in axiomatic form: "When roosters wake crowing
                    hoarse, summer is here." One of his sons, caught in an argument, relies on the old maxim,
                    if the shoe fits, wear it. Eliza Birdwell also employs proverbial expressions. Since she has always
                    insisted on personal cleanliness she opposes building a bathroom in the house, a needless expense
                    which would be simpjfy carrying coals to Newcastle. Some-what of a fatalist, she admonishes her
                    husband, "Don't whistle till thee's out of the woods," and she
                    insists that "Bad things go by threes." Chad Lewis, reproved by his mother,
                    recalls that misery loves company and that it is always good policy, if possible, to kill two birds
                    with one stone. And Mrs. Murphy in the midst of a family festival exults: "‘As
                    the old lady said’ … ‘"When I make water, I make water.
                    When I make tea, I make tea."’"<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>Jessamyn West's fiction, it must be apparent, has many merits, but two certainly stand out:
                    her characterization and her feeling for language. If her narratives seem unexciting and even
                    incoherent at times, her people are a constant delight, freshly conceived, individual, even a bit
                    eccentric. The fecundity of her imagination is surprising. Generally commonsensical but often
                    endowed with a quirky humor or an ironical point of view, her characters enter the reader's
                    presence in full stature and linger there like old acquaintances. The distinguished contemporary
                    novelist Eudora Welty, reviewing <hi rend="i">The Witch Diggers,</hi> remarks that the novel could
                    be labeled "Indiana, 1899, Breughel," a remark which captures memorably the genre

                    Wilson, discussing the same novel, also pays tribute to the characterization but observes that the

                    "Chaucerian dimension," a novel perhaps too ambitious for the author's
                    technical powers, but emphasizes what he calls Miss West's "gleaming
                    moments" and praises her mastery "of the swift descriptive phrase and of the
                    intimate revelatory action."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a 1957 essay Jessamyn West stated briefly some of her ideas about the writing of fiction.
                    "Any serious novel," she says, "is the result of a writer's
                    struggle with himself, the world in which he lives, and the means at hand or which he develops to
                    body forth this world fictionally."<hi rend="sup">30</hi> This self-struggle is paramount
                    and continuous for writing is hard work and success does not come easily. The writer's goal
                    she expresses as "openness" which she equates with "space" and
                    "exposure," not hostility. Moreover, she agrees with Ernest Hemingway that a
                    writer must write truly; there must be no falsification, no hypocrisy. Whatever else might be said
                    about Miss West's work, there can be no question about her dedication to her craft nor
                    about the vitality of her people and the language which clothes them.</p>
            <p>It is possible that readers might weary of the domestic environment, not to mention the rural
                    setting, of many of the fictions and might demand characters with greater sophistication. But other
                    novelists treat urban scenes, often with doubtful success or with a spurious sensationalism the
                    appeal of which wanes almost as soon as it lures the reader beyond the opening chapters. Certainly
                    few contemporary writers evince the ability to create people with the idiosyncrasies, homeliness,
                    honesty, wit, and simple humanity of those in whose portraiture Jessamyn West excels. A reader must
                    be grateful for her precision, her authenticity, and her charm. She is a writer to be treasured.</p>

            <p>A dozen aerial bombs shattered the calm around the usually peaceful prairie countryside of Brook,
                    Indiana. The noise that Wednesday, September 23, 1908, announced the arrival at writer George
                    Ade's Hazelden Farm of William Howard Taft, the Republican presidential candidate, to make
                    the first speech in his campaign tour against Democrat William Jennings Bryan. A caravan of cars
                    brought Taft to Ade's farm from the railroad, eight miles distant, along with Indiana
                    gubernatorial candidate James E. Watson and other dignitaries for perhaps the biggest campaign rally
                    northwestern Indiana had ever seen.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Taft spoke there because he thought that a
                    rally already planned for Ade's farm by the Indiana Republican committee offered a
                    convenient opportunity to publicize the national ticket in a state beset by factional difficulties.
                    In addition, the Ade rally marked a significant reversal in the campaign strategy of the 1908
                    national Republican ticket. When the campaign opened, national party chairman Frank H. Hitchcock had
                    planned that Taft would conduct a front porch style campaign from Hot Springs, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Hitchcock had urged the candidate to decline requests from around the country for
                    personal appearances, including one to speak at the unveiling of the Benjamin Harrison memorial in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Taft, however, was not pleased with Hitchcock's strategy
                    and had so informed the chairman during a conference at Hot Springs in mid-August.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Also, Taft was receiving advice that he should ignore the announced decision of limiting the
                    campaign "to porch speeches in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>."∗ The influential Republican George B. Cortelyou, for example,
                    urged Taft to make personal appearances if necessary because "There are too many State
                    fights. … We are not at the moment the militant organization we ought to be."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    Beveridge, a leading progressive, wrote to Lucius B. Swift—who at this time was one of
                    Taft's Indiana enthusiasts—that while Taft's nomination was satisfying,
                    vice presidential candidate James S. Sherman was too conservative and Watson "represents
                    all the worst phases of our political life."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Swift sent a description
                    of state politics to President Roosevelt, who in turn forwarded the information to Taft. The

                    Indiana Republican committee updating alarmingly the Indiana situation. Claypool's first
                    letter of September 4 reported that "the political situation in Indiana <hi rend="i">today</hi> took a sudden turn for the worse" when Republican Governor J. Frank Hanly,
                    "against the advice of all the Republican leaders in the state," called a special
                    session of the legislature for September 18 to consider a county local option bill. Claypool warned
                    that the resulting bitter struggle "will lose Indiana to the national ticket. It is the
                    most outrageous proceeding that has happened in Indiana Politics in thirty years."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The temperance issue—particularly the question of county
                    option—had been an issue in state politics at least since the legislature passed a mild
                    county option bill in 1895. Governor Hanly had tried unsuccessfully to get the 1907 legislature to
                    broaden the local option law, but in 1908 he did persuade the state Republican convention to adopt a
                    county option plank in its platform.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Candidate Watson embraced the temperance

            </p>
            <p>The day after sending his first appraisal of Governor Hanly's actions Claypool sent a second
                    letter to Taft in which he expanded upon the situation. He reiterated his report of the disruption
                    he thought the governor was causing in the state Republican party, and he stated that many suspected
                    that Hanly, "who is a religious bigot," was secretly trying to aid the Democratic
                    candidate, Bryan. Claypool thought the only man in Indiana who might have persuaded Hanly to drop
                    the whole affair was conservative Vice President Charles Warren Fairbanks, then at his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    get the presidential nomination at the national convention. Hitchcock saw Fairbanks briefly on the
                    evening of September 4 but had no success in persuading the vice president to speak for the national
                        ticket.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Taft responded to Claypool's letters on September 9, the
                    day after his arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but, because his own plans were still unsettled, he could only express gratitude for
                    the information and hope that "there may be some way out of the difficulty in which the
                    Governor's action seems to have put you."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    information indicating a situation in Indiana increasingly unfavorable to the national ticket.
                    Foulke wrote to Taft and accused the Republican state committee of bungling the campaign and of
                    sending out speakers who were "reactionaries and out-worn party hacks to give us the old

                    crowd, and that Hernly had invited a variety of big names to participate. The article claimed that
                    "This rally was planned by Mr. Ade and Mr. Hernly … last spring. Ade is

            <p>That, however, was not quite the way Ade recalled a conversation with Hernly during a visit to
                    Hazelden the previous spring. Hernly, though "meaning well, has put me into an embarassing
                    position," Ade lamented several days after the article had appeared in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Hernly had mentioned the idea to reporters. But Ade insisted that he had regarded the
                    whole affair "as one of Charley's jokes until the other day I found a big
                    first-page article in the Star." Otherwise, Ade privately explained, "I would have
                    headed off the barbecue idea long ago if I had thought that people were going to take it
                    seriously." Ade could offer a variety of arguments why the rally would not be a good
                    idea—distance of the farm from the railroad, the difficulty of feeding such a large crowd
                    (he estimated the cost of forty cattle at $4,000), and the better use of the time and
                    money elsewhere. Although he was willing to assist in the campaign, Ade did not want a Hazelden
                    rally. Unfortunately, Ade lamented, "Hernly … has talked so much about it that
                    possibly we will be compelled to go ahead and make good."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> In fact,
                    Hernly's announcement had excited many Newton County Republicans who took the plans to be
                    accomplished fact.</p>
            <p>Although Ade delicately tried to back out of the situation which Hernly had thrust upon him, he found
                    he could not. He soon received a letter from gubernatorial candidate Watson bubbling with
                        enthusiasm.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Hernly meanwhile sent an invitation to Taft in <placeName>

                    barely contain itself at the thought of a major political event occurring in Brook. The paper

                    problems in holding a large rally there could be overcome. The enterprise was bound to be a
                    "Success" and "the greatest rally in the history of Indiana
                        Republicanism."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taft did not reply immediately to Hernly's invitation perhaps because he was traveling from
                    Hot Springs to Middle Bass Island around this time. In a second letter several days later Hernly
                    argued that farmers from <placeName>

                    time to evaluate the Indiana situation for him "to accept the kind invitation."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Within a few days, however, the situation had changed. Possibly Taft had some
                    rapid second thoughts about Indiana and the need to rally support for the national ticket in a state
                    which seemed from information he had received to be dividing over the temperance issue. Since a
                    speaking tour from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> westward was being planned anyway, a visit—even a short one—in
                    Indiana apparently must have seemed increasingly a good idea.</p>
            <p>A crucial development in getting Taft to come to Ade's farm presumably was the timely
                    intervention of Will H. Hays, the young chairman of the party's state speakers bureau. Ade
                    presented Hays with plans for the rally and, probably at Hernly's urging, noted how
                    valuable Taft's appearance would be. Hays realized that Taft would probably wish to make
                    his first speech in a major city—and indeed Hitchcock was planning on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>—but at the same time Hays thought the whole idea just audacious enough to be
                    worth pursuing. So around September 10 Hays telephoned Taft at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>
               <hi rend="sup">38</hi> and, noting that Brook was on the way from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, again asked Taft to attend the rally. Hays' telephone call elicited a
                    response which Hernly's letters had not. To Hays' surprise, Taft said he
                    remembered Ade as a member of the notification committee<hi rend="sup">39</hi> and that he had
                    always enjoyed Ade's writing, especially the musical <hi rend="i">The Sultan of Sulu.</hi>
                    Hays outlined the rally plans, and Taft reportedly said, "‘I will go to the farm
                    at Brook and see the Sultan of Sulu.’"<hi rend="sup">40</hi> In his telephone
                    conversation with Hitchcock on September 11, Taft asked the chairman to make the necessary
                    arrangements for a stop at Brook.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By September 14 Taft's appearance at Ade's farm was accepted as the first speech on
                    the itinerary. The exact date of the rally, however, had not been determined.<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    Hays conferred by telephone with Hitchcock on the fourteenth, but they did not settle on a final
                    date. <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Not everyone considered the rally a good idea. Herbert E. Hess of Plymouth, Indiana, wrote
                    indignantly to Taft about having the only Indiana speech at "the ostentatious and luxurious
                    country home of Indiana's most ambitious comedy opera writer, Mr. George Ade."
                    That would not be the location from which to appeal to labor, Negro, and business voters; instead,
                    he urged Taft to speak at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> The most restrained reaction came from the Kentland <hi rend="i">Democrat.</hi> Under the headline "Big Horse Show Here Next Week" the paper
                    told how the days of the local horse show had been twice altered to avoid conflicting with the
                    appearance of Taft at Ade's farm, some dozen miles north of Kentland. The horse show would
                    be September 24 to 26, beginning a day after the rally, an unnecessary accommodation the paper
                    thought. "Therefore let nobody become ‘mixed’ as to the time, but
                    prepare to join the crowd and enjoy the entertainment provided for all who will attend."
                    The paper clearly preferred horse shows to Taft rallies.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Once Taft's decision to appear at Ade's farm had been confirmed, there were
                    necessary arrangements to be made with the railroads. A special train was arranged for Taft and

                    " ‘Three cheers for the next President,’" and the crowd
                    cheered again. Taft passed a few words with Indiana Senator James A. Hemenway, who climbed up on the
                    railing around the platform, and with Indiana Congressman James Overstreet. Though Taft did not make
                    a speech, he did quip to the crowd. " ‘We have been traveling sixty miles an

                    </placeName>, Indiana, and Southern Railway. A few minutes later, at noon, the train stopped at Ade,
                    a small station about six miles west of Brook and eight miles from the farm. The special was an hour
                    early, and, as no one met it, only the hissing and clanking of the standing steam locomotive broke
                    the prairie silence.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> While waiting, Taft went up front to the engine and
                    congratulated the conductor and engineer on the speed of the morning's run. "Then,
                    in a halo of dust," states one report, "a Newton County ‘Barney
                    Oldfield’ appeared, smashing the gravel road motor car record." The local
                    committee had been informed of the train's early arrival only at the last minute and so the
                    first automobile to the station arrived after the train.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

            <p>At Ade's farm the program had been underway since 9:30. Some guests had come by automobile,
                    perhaps 200 of the vehicles in all arriving at the farm. Many more visitors came in the excursion
                    trains which arrived all during the morning at Brook and which were shunted onto the limited
                    sidings. Hundreds of passengers were hauled the two miles to Hazelden Farm by a variety of
                    conveyances which Ade had hired and which paraded back and forth along the road all morning. A
                    decision to bring Taft's train to Brook station was not made in time to make the necessary
                    arrangements. The Brook Band, the Purdue Military Band, and the Juvenile Band of Monticello
                    performed before noon. A variety of local politicians addressed the crowd, much of which sat on two
                    long sections of circus bleachers arranged facing the house and underneath the large shade trees.
                    Tents had been set up where refreshments were sold and where campaign literature, badges, and
                    souvenir post cards were given away. At noon the Second Regiment Band from <placeName>

                    and Watson hurried off in a caravan of six automobiles to greet the candidate.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>From where Taft's train had stopped, it was six miles due east to Brook along a straight
                    road parched by a month's dry weather. Small posters with pictures of Taft and Watson and
                    flags had been tacked to poles along the way. The main street of Brook was decorated with arches,
                    each with pictures of the candidates framed in evergreen hanging from it. Signs saying
                    "Welcome," done in evergreen and framed in marigolds, were everywhere. And any
                    remaining space in Brook was covered with red, white, and blue bunting. Two miles farther on east
                    was Hazelden Farm. When the automobile caravan approached the farm at 12:45, the aerial bombs were
                    set off to salute Taft's arrival, the white smoke clearing from the grounds only slowly in
                    the still noon air. As the car carrying Taft pulled onto the grounds, it was surrounded by the
                    "throng of agriculturists,"<hi rend="sup">62</hi> and several bands started to
                    play. Somehow the candidate managed to get into the house, where a light luncheon was served. The
                    crowd meanwhile dined on either picnic lunches or 2,000 "full dinner pails"
                    available for a quarter each and containing. sandwiches and pickles. While everyone was eating, the
                    Harlequin Glee Club from Purdue entertained.</p>
            <p>After a brief luncheon, Taft, Ade, Watson, and others in the official party stepped from the house at
                    1:15 P.M. to the decorated speakers' platform. Having been briefly introduced by Ade, Taft
                    began his speech by referring to the day's host as the "Indiana Sultan of
                    Sulu" and asserting that the Philippine original had no advantage over Ade as an
                    entertainer. He also punned, perhaps reflecting some of the luncheon banter, how the rally had
                    " ‘aided his campaign.’"<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
                    <hi rend="i">Explaining why he was</hi> at <hi rend="i">Ade's farm, Taft said that he had

                    he asserted, "1 seized the opportunity … to ask you … whether your

                    into whose hands you wish to put the executive power over the destinies of this Nation for four
                    years." He turned to Bryan's career and argued that it had been detrimental to the
                    American farmer. Only after the establishment <list type="footnotes">

                            Blodgett's unobjective reporting in 1908 that he caustically referred to Brook
                            ("You start day before yesterday and arrive day after tomorrow.") even

                    1897, replacing the Democratic Wilson-Gorman bill, had farm prices improved. As to the protective
                    tariffs passed by the Republicans, which the Democrats argued worked hardship upon the farmer, Taft
                    asked his audience to refer to their own experience and draw their own conclusions. In conclusion,
                    Taft said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"I submit to you gentlemen that till the soil; I submit to you who through the rural

                            the measures of public men, whether the experience of the country in the economic theories
                            of Mr. Bryan is such as to warrant the belief that if he is elected in November he will
                            restore the necessary confidence and bring out the capital, the delay in the coming of which

                    </placeName>, a member of Taft's party. Afterwards, "300 pounds of Taft was again
                    wedged through apparently impregnable ranks of people to the automobiles." Then Taft
                    "and his comet-like tail of newspaper correspondents vanished in a cloud of
                        dust,"<hi rend="sup">65</hi> returning to the train and speeding on to <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the second speech of his tour that evening at Orchestra Hall. Taft had not waited
                    through the speech by Watson, who emphasized state issues, especially local option. There were more
                    speeches, more bands, and more fireworks through the afternoon and into the night, but the
                    significant event—the speech of William Howard Taft—had passed.</p>
            <p>While the general reaction of those reporting the rally was favorable, there was criticism of the day
                    at Ade's farm. The weekly Kentland <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> reported in prime space that
                    the horse show was a success; only elsewhere did the paper report on the affair up at Ade's
                    farm. The rally was a "success," the paper yawned, in that a lot of people and two
                    well known men, Taft and Watson, were there. But, "the people met with disappointment and
                    inconvenience." The disappointment stemmed from the shortness of Taft's speech and
                    the inconvenience from the discovery by many local farmers hired by Ade to provide free
                    transportation between Brook and the farm that they could get away with charging for the return trip
                    to the trains. One local farmer, the <hi rend="i">Democrat</hi> alleged, picked up $62.50
                    that way.<hi rend="sup">66</hi>

            <p>Other observers were more favorably impressed. A <placeName>

                    </placeName> paper said that Ade's rally was the most magnificent affair "since

                        hospitality.’"<hi rend="sup">68</hi> The Rennselaer <hi rend="i">Republican</hi> called it "the greatest event of the kind."<hi rend="sup">69</hi>
                    And, if the reaction of one observer was reasonably typical, then the rally was indeed a great
                    success: "Taft was here and such a crowd of people 25,000 George Ade has done a great thing
                    well," reads the message on one of the souvenir post cards.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> That this
                    observer thought the crowd to be so large indicates the tremendous impression which the vast numbers
                    probably made on those attending, but a more accurate estimate of the number of people at
                    Ade's farm is probably about 10,000.<hi rend="sup">71</hi> Regardless of the exact size of
                    the crowd, as Ade's father later wrote, "Everybody went home impressed with the
                    fact that they had attended the greatest and most interesting political gathering ever held in this
                    section of Indiana."<hi rend="sup">72</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Taft opened his campaign tour at Ade's farm because Hernly's rally offered a
                    convenient occasion in Indiana to draw attention to the national campaign. Taft came to Brook to
                    talk about the presidential campaign: he did not refer to the divisive state issues nor recommend
                    state candidates; he simply told farmers how dangerous it would be for them to vote for Bryan. In
                    the ensuing election, Taft carried Indiana by 10,000 votes while Democratic gubernatorial candidate
                    Thomas R. Marshall defeated Watson by 15,000 votes.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> There is no conclusive
                    evidence, but Taft's personal appearance in the state was probably not in vain. In his

            <p>From Indiana's territorial period to the 1850s the large preponderance of its exports
                    floated southward on flatboats to markets along the lower <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>.
                    This outgoing trade consisted principally of bulky and heavy products from farms and forests, some
                    of which underwent no processing or manufacturing before leaving Indiana. The cargoes carried by
                    flatboats ranged from live animals such as hogs and chickens to corn, wheat, oats, meal, flour,
                    pork, lard, beef, venison, whisky, vegetables, sawed lumber, hoop poles, cheese, furs, feathers,
                    beeswax, and ginseng. These boats varied much in size and appearance and were often constructed to
                    suit the cargo and whim of their builders. Made locally and suitable only for the one way trip
                    downstream, their building, loading, and navigation was at times a cooperative venture among
                    neighbors. In other instances merchants or traders collected produce and conveyed it to market on
                    these floating arks.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As early as 1820 the legislature of Indiana began designating numerous streams within the state as
                    public highways, making them open for the passage of flatboats and other craft. Fines were provided
                    for persons obstructing these export arteries, though mill dams could be erected on them if
                    provision were made for the passage of boats. Rivers were at times declared public highways up to
                    certain mills. Thus, the Patoka was so declared from its mouth to Mosley's mill; Little
                    Pigeon, from its mouth to John Barker's mill. Hundreds of flatboats descended
                    Indiana's rivers annually during at least the 1820s through the early 1850s, making
                    flatboating a common experience for men and boys. Like Abe Lincoln, numerous pioneer lads got their
                    first significant exposure to the "outside world" when they spent several weeks or
                    even a few months away from home on account of flatboat trips to the warmer clime and generally more
                    developed <list type="footnotes">

                    trading centers. In the early part of the nineteenth century the boatmen frequently made the return
                    journey by foot, walking the Natchez and other trails. From the twenties, however, many of them had
                    the thrill and excitement of making the return journey via steamboat. Some of the pioneers made
                    dozens of flatboat trips to the lower <placeName>

            <p>The letters which follow tell of four flatboat trips which William P. Dole made during the early
                    1840s from Clinton, located on the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> about sixteen miles above <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. They constitute only a portion of the correspondence between Dole and his
                    second wife Jane Bryson Dole for these trips. Moreover, there were additional flatboat trips not
                    here represented.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Most of the letters were penned by Dole while floating
                    downstream or from various market points along the lower <placeName>

                    </placeName>. They reveal much about the obstructions to and hazards from flatboat navigation, offer
                    interesting vignettes of life aboard flat-boats, afford glimpses of the difficulties,
                    disappointments, and delays often involved in disposing of produce; and indicate the personal
                    inconveniences and concerns arising from weeks away from home and business. The few letters from
                    Jane Dole to her husband add vivid and moving reminders that the inconveniences and concerns could
                    be even greater for wives and mothers at home than for their absent husbands.</p>

                                 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The handwritten letters were transcribed from
                                            photocopies. Spacing of dates, openings, and closings has been standardized
                                            throughout; paragraphing is as in the photocopies. Elevated letters have
                                            been brought down to the line; obvious repetitions, flourishes, and items
                                            crossed out have been omitted. Commas apparently intended for periods have
                                            been changed to periods; otherwise punctuation is unchanged. Errors in
                                            spelling remain; [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] is used only when there might be a
                                            question of an error in transcription or printing. Obvious capitals or lower
                                            case letters have been retained; several letters (c, m, s, w, y) are not
                                            always distinguishable as capital or lower case, and the editor has selected
                                            according to size and letter formation. Where words are indistinguishable, a
                                            possible insertion has been made in brackets. Bracketed items indicate
                                            insertions by the editor. Words or letters followed by a question mark in
                                            brackets indicate the editor has chosen one alternative of possible
                                            transcriptions because of ambiguously formed letters. The sign,
                                            @, has been used in place of Dole's
                                            "a" with an irregular swirl which seems to mean the same
                                            thing. Space has been left to indicate sentence groupings where there is no
                                            punctuation in order to increase readability. When possible, places have
                                            been located except for Cairo, Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez, and <placeName>

                                            people been identified because adequate sources are lacking. According to
                                            Mrs. Gray "Brother Joseph" and Allen mentioned in the

                                            obstructions to navigation. Because of such obstructions detailed guides
                                            were published to warn boatmen of their location and give helpful

                                    at Grand Gulph or Natchess what has become of him I cannot tell but he has had more
                                    than time to return &amp; I cannot hear from him. I had an opertunity of selling
                                    some corn here at a price that would save us cost &amp; stopped &amp; sent
                                    Stewart to Natchus for Kile but no Kile or Letter was to be found consequently I am
                                    Left to guess at what to do with the corn I have however conlluded to stop the Load
                                    here as the Price of corn here will pay us back our money while the news from N.
                                    Orl[ans?] is that corn is down to 35 cts pr Bushel &amp; the best I can hear it
                                    is 40 cts which would be a Loossing buisiness–I have Sold about 5.00 [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] bushels here &amp; all my Pork &amp; Lard the corn
                                    will pay cost &amp; I have made about $100.00 clear on my Little Lot
                                    of Pork which is doing Very well with that. I shall start for N. Orleans this
                                    morning with my hogs as I cannot sell them here &amp; the report from below is
                                    that they are Very Low ther[e?] but raising a Little &amp; I think they will
                                    come up a Little before I Sell. I shall send two or 3 <list type="footnotes">

                                 <hi rend="sup">12</hi> In the 1840s there was no federal bank in
                                            operation, but numerous banks existed under varying degrees of state
                                            supervision. Since banks generally issued notes which circulated as money,
                                            it was often impossible to know their fair exchange value. Hence notes were
                                            frequently discounted by the person or bank which received them, a practice
                                            known as note shaving. In this instance the "shaving" had
                                            been severe–about thirty-three and a third per cent. For a

                                    often think of the times you and him have–I have Just been shown by a

                                    of about $2.00. what I shall be able to do with my Land is more than I
                                    can yet tell a few days moore will tell the story however–My grocery

                                            below Memphis. He also suggests that it then had decidedly the advantage
                                            over Memphis in the river business on account of its landing and bid fair to

                                            has a similar comment and predicts that Fort Pickering will doubtless take

                        <p>I take this opportunity of writing to you, and I donot know wht to write, for it has
                                    been so long since I heard from you. it has been 3 weeks since I heard from you. I
                                    got a letter from Shawnetown and I expected another in a short time but was
                                    disapointed from mail to mail if there is anything the matter of courese you are
                                    excuseable but if not I think I have good reason to scold, for it has caused me a
                                    great deal of uneasiness. I have written 4 letters to you, and I think you will get
                                    some of them. I directed them all to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, for I thought it the most certain place to get them I have been sick
                                    since you left home, but am a little better now So that I can Sit up Some I cant
                                    tell you what has been the matter for it has been every thing but the worst was a
                                    pain in my head and side the Doctor thinks I took cold after the Measles and settle
                                    in my Side I want you to come home as quick as you can I dont want to make you
                                    uneasy and neglect your buisness to come for I have all atention that is nesesary I
                                    have had the Doctor but I dont think he done me any good and I quit takeing his
                                    Medison for he is not my Doctor notime he only came when it suited him. it is bad
                                    [to?] be a lone and be well but it is much worse to be sick. I have been alone 2
                                    before but I dont think I ever past the time So unhappy before I have not been well
                                    anugh to ride out any yet and but little of time that I could leave my room but one
                                    sattisfaction I have to know the time will come when you will be with me at
                                    home–I want you not to make arangements to go back their again but I fear
                                    if the prices be as bad as we here they ar that you <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-067-4-062"/> will not have the chance to go a gain but I have made
                                    up my mind for the worst and if I am disappointed let it be a greeable so but one
                                    satisfaction greater then all others is to know that I have you for wich is all the
                                    real happiness I want in this world with you I could be happy let my sittuation be
                                    what it may it is t[im ?] e I quit wrteing for I am writing so bad you cant read it
                                    but I deserve credit for writing as well as I do for I have a very soar Blister on

                                    &amp; nothing but ruin staring me in the face so far as buisiness is concerned

            <p>In 1794 when the new American military post of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> was occupied, General Anthony Wayne wrote to Colonel John Francis Hamtramck, the first
                    commander, that the fort "may well be esteemed the Key or barrier between the Navigable
                    waters of the Gulphs of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Lawrence</settlement>
                    </placeName> as well as between the Indian tribes settled along the margins of those waters;
                    &amp; as such it has always been considered both by the French &amp; British who make it a
                    grand deposit for their Indian warehouses or Stores" (p. 49). This insight of General
                    Wayne's is the theme of Professor Woehrmann's book. He thus gives a proper
                    emphasis to the often neglected fact that the headwaters of the Maumee, where <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> was built, formed one of the great crossroads in the West. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> was a key spot for Indian trade and for military control over a large area.</p>
            <p>Noting first the history of the French and the British at the location, Woehrmann moves quickly to
                    the story of American activity at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> from its founding to its abandonment in 1819. Using a chiefly topical arrangement, he
                    discusses the establishment of the fort as a culmination of the drive against the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName> Indians that was mounted by Josiah Harmar, Arthur St. Clair, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, the administrative and logistical problems of the post, the history of the government
                    trading factory and the Indian agency at the site, and the vital role played by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the War of 1812. He has filled in with great detail the well known outline of events
                    at the fort and agency by heavy reliance on the letters and reports of the government officials and
                    agents who operated there. In his accounts of the interplay between Indian missionaries, factors,
                    Indian agents, and army officers he shows clearly how personal conflicts endangered the smooth
                    operation of the federal Indian policy and by such case studies helps to illustrate a larger
                    picture. Even though, as Woehrmann asserts, the fort was "largely a failure to 1812 as a
                    government trading post, as a center of ‘civilization,’ and as an Indian
                    agency" (p. 256), it managed to survive the severe military test of the War of 1812 and
                    thereby guaranteed American control in the area.</p>
            <p>The book, though thoroughly researched and neatly printed, is seriously marred by a dissertation
                    style that should have been revised before the work was published. Items from the sources are often
                    strung out like a chronicle rather than used as materials from which <pb n="365" id="VAA4025-067-4-067"/> to create a readable narrative or a stimulating analysis, and rough

            <p>In recent years considerable effort has been made to utilize election returns, voting patterns in

                    commemorating Indiana's sesqui-centennial of statehood. Volume III, <hi rend="i">Indiana in

                    Barnhart, long a leader in the study and writing of Indiana, was scheduled to write the present
                    volume. After his illness and then his death in December, 1967, Dorothy L. Riker, senior editor of
                    the Indiana Historical Society, completed the assignment. The resulting volume traces
                    Indiana's history from the days of the prehistoric Indians to the coming of statehood.</p>
            <p>The chapter "Indiana's Prehistory" by James H. Kellar, archaeologist for
                    the Indiana Historical Society, is an erudite study, which in parts may seem somewhat technical to
                    the average reader. Other chapters give careful attention to topics discussing international
                    rivalries, conflicts with the Indian, struggles between the supporters of Governor William Henry
                    Harrison and his opponents, and the economic problems of pioneer life. Interesting material is
                    presented concerning members of the Constitutional Convention of 1816. Only nine members had never
                    lived south of the Mason-Dixon Line (p. 443), but the constitutional fathers took pains to eliminate
                    the undemocratic features found in "the early fundamental law of the southern states with
                    their property qualifications for office holding and <pb n="366" id="VAA4025-067-4-068"/> voting,
                    unequal representation, and protection of slavery, which tended to produce an aristocratic social
                    structure" (p. 463).</p>
            <p>A few minor errors may be noted. In connection with the pre-revolutionary period <placeName>

                    1765, not 1764 (p. 159). It would be more precise, moreover, in locating Fort Steuben (p. 247), to
                    say that it was on the present site of Steubenville twenty-three miles north of Wheeling.</p>

            <p>Few political leaders from the American past offer the historian and biographer a more rewarding and
                    challenging subject than Indiana's Albert Jeremiah Beveridge. He touched the political
                    culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries at a number of strategic and revealing
                    points–midwestern Republicanism, GOP conservatism, imperialism, Rooseveltian
                    progressivism, insurgency, and the Progressive party of 1912–and to understand the
                    dynamics of his leadership is to understand a great deal of the political history of that epoch. One
                    of the earliest scholarly works to be written on the progressive movement, Claude G.
                    Bowers' <hi rend="i">Beveridge and the Progressive Era</hi> (1932), is a full length study
                    of his career. Bowers made good use of the voluminous Beveridge papers, and his spirited account has
                    been one of the most durable studies of American progressivism. But Bowers, a friend and admirer of
                    the Indiana leader, did not produce an objective and probing interpretation, and the appearance of
                    new source materials and new historical approaches has rendered his volume increasingly inadequate.
                    Professor John Braeman, a young historian at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, has now written a book that meets the need for a modern biography.</p>
            <p>Braeman began work on Beveridge as a result of his interest in the progressive movement, and in this
                    biography he has sought to illuminate the complexity and the paradox of progressivism. The book is
                    based on impressive research in the Beveridge papers, numerous collateral collections, Indiana
                    newspapers, public documents, and Beveridge's own extensive writings. It is superbly
                    organized and <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-067-4-069"/> well proportioned in its coverage. Braeman
                    succeeds in locating Beveridge both in the tangle of Indiana politics and in the broader milieu of
                    the national political scene. He throws a good deal of light on the unending factional struggles
                    within Indiana's Republican party. He is sympathetic toward his subject but forthright in
                    dealing with Beveridge's less attractive qualities. The heart of Braeman's study
                    is the treatment of Beveridge's political career–particularly his two terms in
                    the Senate and his experiences as a member of the Progressive party. But careful consideration is
                    also given to Beveridge's writing of history, and in this respect, as in many others,
                    Braeman goes far beyond Bowers.</p>
            <p>Beveridge was throughout life an ardent nationalist and a thoroughgoing Hamiltonian. He was
                    "never temperamentally a radical or even a reformer," his new biographer asserts.
                    "He was a worshiper of order, efficiency, and material progress" (p. 273). Braeman
                    does not resolve all of the paradoxes in Beveridge's career, but his interpretation of the
                    major aspects of the Hoosier's politics is generally sound and persuasive. He is not as
                    clear as he might be on the reasons for Beveridge's shift to progressivism, on the
                    relationship between his views on foreign policy and his domestic reformism, and on his growing
                    conservatism in his later years. One also misses a sharply etched overall interpretation of this
                    remarkable man. Although Braeman seems to avoid psychoanalytic explanations, he displays poise,
                    common sense, and critical judgment in elucidating Beveridge's thought and behavior.
                    Indeed, the merits of this scholarly and well written biography, one of the best yet written of a
                    key progressive leader, will commend it to all serious students of Indiana history and of the recent
                    American past.</p>

            <p>Several colleagues of the editor, John Butt, in the department of economic history at Strathclyde
                    University in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName> have written this series of essays. This university is in close proximity to New
                    Lanark, the site of Robert Owen's industrial empire and the seat of his early innovations
                    in the field of factory and educational reforms. The essays examine several areas of Owen's
                    life and experiences, starting with his rise from small beginnings as a cotton spinner to his
                    position of leadership in the field of cotton manufacturing. They also trace Owen's role as
                    an educational reformer; the New Lanark <pb n="368" id="VAA4025-067-4-070"/> school with its broad
                    curriculum, and discipline based upon kindness, attracted wide attention. Much emphasis is given to
                    Owen's attempt to secure parliamentary factory reform laws, his more radical moves toward
                    communitarianismo, and his final role as a founder of the cooperative movement.</p>
            <p>The essay on Owen as a businessman reveals him to be a shrewd financier, often with the problems of
                    operating on large sums of borrowed capital and faced with several reorganizations because of
                    disaffected partners. The concluding essay gives details of the building of the New Lanark Mills and
                    the model factory village along with interesting accounts of the mechanical workings of the plant.
                    One small part of the mill is in use today. The New Lanark Association is restoring some of the
                    homes of the workers to their original state, a project which it hopes to complete as a memorial to
                    Owen and the Industrial Revolution.</p>
            <p>These writings reveal some of Owen's inconsistencies. He attacked religion, and, at the same
                    time, the core of his work was the foremost Christian principle of charity toward all. He turned to
                    spiritualism in his last years. His belief in the profit motive as a legitimate one in business is
                    in sharp contrast to his denunciation of private property. "Owen was certainly good at
                    handing down the tablets of law but bad at debating their validity. Much substantiation of this can
                    be found in Dr. Fraser's essay (in this series) where it is made plain that Owen's
                    relationship with the working classes was essentially that of a paternalist" (p. 14).</p>
            <p>Butt believes that Owen's reputation does not gain by unscholarly idolatry, but concludes:
                    "We regard Robert Owen as a great inspirer of social movements rather than an efficient
                    organizer of social advances. As a truly great man, Owen does not require adulation" (p.
                    16).</p>
            <p>The book is attractively illustrated with pictures of New Lanark, Owen and other personalities,
                    charts of model communities, tables of the mill's industrial output, and a chronology of
                    Owen's life. One error was noted in the failure to include footnotes for numbers 44-69 in
                    Chapter 5. American readers will note that references to the <placeName>

                    valuable addition to Owenite literature in this the two hundredth anniversary of his birth.</p>

                    faced a central conflict of developing a state university based upon the broader vocational, or
                    applied, philosophy of the Morrill Act or of forming an institution in the image of the older
                    colleges such as <placeName>

                    </placeName> universities. Joseph Sullivant worked to secure the state university at the site of the
                    state capital. His triangular philosophy was outlined in the seal he designed for the institution.
                    Agriculture was to be basic, supporting the liberal and mechanical arts. There was internal turmoil
                    over both the location of the institution and the definition of its objectives.</p>
            <p>Kinnison includes a good chapter on the role of Rutherford B. Hayes, who, like so many
                    politico-trustees of the period, had a well developed idea of what he wanted to see <placeName>

                    </placeName> State become as the central institution in the state's public educational
                    system. Two chapters of this brief study treat the central themes of professors and students. The
                    issues of academic freedom and professorial tenure were at times ensnared in both state and board of
                    trustees politics. One now wonders how the trustees could have interfered with the administration of
                    Edward Orton because he was obviously a man of genuine scholarly capability, even though he did take
                    radical views toward religion, business, and society. The matter of chapel services in the era of
                    rising science and Darwinism caused <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> State the same trouble as was common in other schools. The board of trustees placed
                    great score by chapel services, and this got in the way of their perception of the larger problems
                    of administering the institution.</p>

                    predominantly local in origin, and not always oriented to the basic purposes of the institution.
                    Perhaps one of the most interesting facts about American university history is the common thread of
                    student relationships. The students at emerging <placeName>

                    </placeName> State acted no differently from those at Indiana, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Miami</region>
                    </placeName>, or Cornell. They were maturing adolescents who resented the stern hands of presidents
                    and faculties who acted the role of <hi rend="i">in loco parentis.</hi> The student publications,
                    underground, poetic, and otherwise, had their say. At <placeName>

                    institution were conditioned somewhat by their reactions toward the presidents. In summary there was
                    a lot of what G. Stanley Hall called "babyism" in the earlier years.</p>
            <p>Kinnison has described the central battle of the emerging institution with the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> farmers. The farmers in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> like farmers everywhere following passage of the Morrill Act misread the full intent of
                    the legislation and created serious problems in the organization and conduct of the

                    city's political machines and its various ethnic blocs has come from a bevy of articles,
                    monographs, and biographies.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, despite an obviously exhaustive bibliography, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> continues to be a favorite city for inquiry by Clio's devotees. John M.
                    Allswang has found enough questions left unanswered about the shifting political allegiances of the
                    city's ethnic groups to apply quantitative methods in search of trends. The result of
                    Allswang's imaginative use of statistical data has been most revealing. He has uncovered
                    many reasons for the development of a solid Democratic vote from the city's ethnics.</p>
            <p>Emerging as the most salient conclusion is the importance given <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-067-4-073"/>
                    the 1928 presidential election and its effect upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ethnic politics. Employing a variety of quantitative and qualitative
                    measures, Allswang concludes that the nomination of Alfred E. Smith for President by the Democrats
                    in 1928 was significantly pivotal to shift partisan loyalties among the city's different
                    peoples. In fact the author calls the 1928 election "certainly the most critical of the
                    period" (p. 207). A combination of Smith's "urbanness, Wetness, Roman
                    Catholicism, or apparent social familiarity" (p. 209) were forces appealing especially to a
                    majority of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ethnic voters. Of course, for Scandinavian and German Protestants,
                    Smith's attributes were not necessarily assets.</p>
            <p>Locally, the fall of Mayor William Hale Thompson's star and the <hi rend="i">cise of Anton
                        J. Cerman's were parallel</hi> developments. The vilification of "Tony
                    Baloney" by Big Bill in 1931 proved disastrous because hyphenated Americans interpreted it
                    as evidence confirming their suspicions that Thompson was antiimmigrant. The consequences were fatal
                    for Thompson; he could not win without ethnic support.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, however, this book has many shortcomings, and they are the result of
                    Allswang's enamorment with his method. The author's failure is the failure of
                    quantitative historians generally. His assemblage of statistics is impressive, but the satisfaction
                    of measuring numerically has blinded him to the reality that "traditional"
                    research still is of value for scholars seeking knowledge. Greater employment by Allswang of
                    newspapers, interviews, and manuscripts would have filled out the skeleton provided by his
                    quantitative data. At stake is the fact that Allswang's "central
                    question" has not fully been answered. One still does not know altogether "what
                    was the role of ethnic groups in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s politics, and to what extent was the changing political balance of power
                    attributable to their political behavior?" (p. 3).</p>
            <p>Unfolding simultaneously are other problems–minor and major. Allswang does not run down
                    completely what his title promises. Instead of carrying his investigation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> elections through 1936, the author stops with the Cermak victory of 1931. Therefore,
                    the reader is left wondering about the long term effect of the Great Depression upon minority voting
                    patterns, and no insight is given for the switch of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> blacks to the Democratic party. For example, no mention is made of Arthur W.
                    Mitchell's defeat of Oscar DePriest in 1934. The election of a Negro Democrat to Congress
                    is too important for it to be ignored by an author examining ethnic and racial voting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the period in which the change occurred. Moreover, had Allswang investigated
                    electoral results in Negro wards after 1931, he would have found blacks remaining more loyal to the
                    party of Abraham Lincoln than he speculated. William L. Dawson, <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-067-4-074"/>
                    for instance, had not, as Allswang alleges, become a Democrat by 1936.</p>
            <p>Also apparent to anyone familiar with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ethnic neighborhoods is another error. Assuming as Allswang has that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> was broken down neatly by precincts along national lines is oversimplification. On a
                    given block in almost any part of the city, except black sections, a Schmidt would live by an Olson
                    and a Goldberg by an O'Rourke. Given the nature and extent of mixture, one can legitimately
                    question the validity of Allswang's whole framework of explaining the ethnic vote by
                    percentages.</p>

                    sources, bibliography, index. $8.50.)</head>
            <p>This well written biography is an important addition to the literature on nineteenth century politics
                    and reform. The tone is sympathetic and realistic. In appraising Joshua R. Giddings, Professor
                    Stewart reaffirms the significance of events that transpired in 1837. A sudden loss of affluence and
                    an unexpected break with his dominating mentor, Elisha Whittlesey, nearly overwhelmed the Ohioan.
                    Weeks of self-examination, however, prepared him to serve new causes–temperance and
                    antislavery. His opportunity came when Whittlesey fatefully resigned from Congress.</p>
            <p>Stewart correctly emphasizes Giddings' "assumption that morality and politics were
                    inseparable …" (p. 45); he concludes, "religious thinking provided the
                    basis of Giddings' decisions …" (p. 252). A traditional
                    Congregationalist influenced by Charles G. Finney's theology, he worked with the Bible
                    Society and the Colonization Society during the precongressional years. Older views to the contrary,
                    he did not make an antislavery statement until 1838. Nor was he an abolitionist, for repeal of the
                    petition gag rule and withdrawal of all federal support for slavery encompassed his program. In the
                    early years of his career Giddings controlled his antislavery agitation because of his concern for
                    Whig economic policies. His failure to make any significant contribution in the legislative struggle
                    over those issues might well have been stressed as it placed his anti-slavery endeavors in proper
                    focus. With respect to organized activity on the left, the author declares that the
                    "problems posed by the Liberty party … [helped make] Giddings act as a cyclone
                    of agitation …" (p. 87). In his notable speech on the annexation of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> he denounced the immediate project, forecast both war with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> and <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-067-4-075"/> slave insurrections, and discussed the slave
                    trade, miscegenation, exploitation, and the immorality of the institution. Giddings also became a
                    tough, opportunistic campaigner. An important instance, omitted from this book, occurred in 1844
                    when he used a letter from Cassius Clay while implying it was written by Henry Clay. Unable to
                    restructure the Whigs he belatedly labored for the 1848 coalition. Once committed to the Free Soil
                    party he was instrumental in preserving its independent position. He operated on the left flank of
                    the Republican movement until ill health forced retirement in 1859.</p>
            <p>This volume captures the main thrust of the man, an evangelical reformer who sought to turn
                    politicians and the populace from support of the peculiar institution. Giddings never advocated
                    complete equality for the Negro, but Stewart documents a struggle for black rights that was advanced
                    for the period. In the age of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan his appeals for the regeneration of
                    the whole people clarify his relationship with Republican leaders. It is unfortunate that the book
                    closes with a rush. The discussion of John Brown's raid would be more balanced if mention
                    were made of the editorial in the Ashtabula <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> declaring that Brown would
                    die with "all the prestige of a martyr …" The treatment of the wartime
                    assignment in Montreal and the war years is thin. Giddings used confrontation to advantage, and a
                    fuller assessment of his adjustment to the realities of the grand confrontation is needed.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Stewart adds another dimension to an understanding of the evangelical crusade against
                    slavery.</p>

            <p>This book is basically a political biography. It treats Stephen Douglas' private life and
                    his position on economic issues only incidentally. Professor Wells is not an apologist for Douglas.
                    No attempt is made to disregard his shortcomings although the author does endeavor to explain the
                    reasons for these faults.</p>
            <p>Douglas is portrayed in the years 1857-1861 as a man who was out of step with the times. He seemed to
                    be unaware of his errors until it was too late to reverse his actions. Notwithstanding his bad
                    timing, Douglas does not emerge as the well intentioned, but occasionally blundering <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> senator, which has often been the case in other volumes on this period of American
                    history. The image of <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-067-4-076"/> Douglas created by Wells allows the
                    reader to view a man who finally realized that his long held political views were no longer
                    applicable to a rapidly changing American political climate. Douglas turned from the former
                    materialistic bias inherent in his view of the nation and its welfare and sacrificed any chance of
                    capturing the presidency in an effort to avert secession.</p>

                    </placeName> contends that Douglas was a nationalist in an age of sectionalism. The reader becomes
                    aware that in another era of American history, Douglas would have been known as a great compromiser,
                    perhaps with a reputation equal to that of Henry Clay. However, it becomes evident that this was not
                    possible in the period of political turmoil which preceded the Civil War.</p>
            <p>Abraham Lincoln, the great political antagonist of Douglas, is given fair treatment in this book. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wells</region>
                    </placeName> makes no attempt to berate Lincoln's image in order to improve
                    Douglas' appearance; Douglas does not emerge as the hero in his encounters with Lincoln.</p>

                        <region type="county">Wells</region>

                    the trauma that marked their early history" (p. 16). It is also questionable whether
                    Douglas "knew better than any other Northern leader, the magnitude of the crisis that was
                    now upon the country and the lateness of the hour" (p. 259).</p>

            <p>This book demonstrates the value of perspective. Given two previous biographies, an autobiography,
                    and numerous other publications touching his life, one could doubt the importance of another Pinchot
                    volume. Yet archivist Harold Pinkett has provided an original segment of American forest and
                    conservation history. As deputy director of the Records Appraisal Division of the National Archives,
                    he is familiar with Pinchot papers which have not been hitherto <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-067-4-077"/>
                    utilized. Pinkett's work focuses sharply on Pinchot's career in forestry. Eighteen
                    crisp chapters contain 150 carefully documented pages outlining Pinchot's contribution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Private and Public Forester</hi> provides a balanced survey of Pinchot's work.
                    It discusses early years in private forestry, the influence of his mentor Sir Dietrich Brandis who
                    believed that "forest management in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> must begin through private enterprise" (p. 24), Pinchot's service on
                    the National Forest Commission during the early years when he was a consulting forester. Ten
                    chapters treat his administration of the federal forests and development of forest policy. Two
                    chapters illuminate his direction of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s state forests.</p>
            <p>Pinkett supplies a narrative of clarity which has relevance for the present. "Conservative
                    Forest Use" is a masterful chapter on the chief forester's enlightened policy.
                    Land in the forest reserves was "to be devoted to the most productive use for the permanent
                    good of the whole people, and not for the temporary benefit of individuals or companies"
                    (p. 58). Under his leadership lease and fee systems were initiated for special forest privileges.
                    Grazing on public lands, the removal of dead and mature timber, and waterpower site development were
                    regulated so that a variety of associated enterprises consonant with forestry could be permanent.
                    The program was so successful that today both private and public forest reserves are lands of many
                    uses. In the present, as a highly charged ecological emotionalism has swept the country with
                    opposition to the multiple use concept, it should be remembered that when the idea was first
                    advanced by Pinchot, not the liberal or radical elements of American society challenged it but the
                    conservative business interests.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most engaging aspect of this book is its acknowledgment of the occasional failures of
                    program and personality which were also part of Pinchot's career. Pinchot held rigidly to
                    his own ideas and opinions, Pinkett describes the circumstances in which alienation developed
                    between Pinchot and Bernhard Fernow (p. 17), Carl A. Schenck (p. 30), and Robert S. Conklin (pp.
                    133-36). Although Pinkett allows the reader to draw his own conclusions, it is clear that Pinchot
                    seldom tolerated differences of professional opinion. Following his own dismissal from the federal
                    service for insubordination and tactless conduct, Pinchot pressed for removal of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>'s commissioner of forestry. At the very least the reader is left to ponder
                    Pinchot's motives when he followed Conklin as the new sheriff of Penn's Woods.</p>
            <p>Pinchot criticized others but could not tolerate criticism which was directed at himself. When the
                    botanist J. G. Lemmon accused him of using erroneous names for trees in <hi rend="i">A Primer of
                        Forestry,</hi> his <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-067-4-078"/> chiding response was nonscientific and
                    unprofessional: "The object of this Division is not to bring the righteous, but sinners to
                    repent-ence. Consequently, it matters little whether, botanically, the names we use are correct or
                    not, while it is of the greatest importance that the practical men in whose hands the future welfare
                    or destruction of the forest areas of this country must necessarily lie, should find themselves as
                    much at home as possible in our publications" (p. 53). Though generally the spirit of the
                    men in the Forest Service was remarkable, Pinchot found it difficult "to forget a
                    man's mistakes or failures, and tended to deny to one who had stumbled an opportunity to
                    make good" (p. 72). In addition to his shortcomings in personal relations, the chief often
                    invited public opposition because he attempted too many changes at once (p. 74).</p>
            <p>Pinkett provides an excellent analysis of the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy. The facts are carefully
                    delineated. At the center was Pinchot's belief in a broad constitutional interpretation of
                    executive and national authority. While Theodore Roosevelt was President, such a philosophy was
                    supported. With the advent of William Howard Taft, a lawyer who held more conservative views,
                    Pinchot's actions– often taken without specific statutory
                    authority–were inappropriate. Pinkett contends that the chief forester became less and
                    less a man of science and more and more a politician. Nevertheless, Pinchot's removal
                    created a backlash which ultimately caused the resignation of Richard A. Ballinger as interior
                    secretary. The reactions to the more recent firing of Douglas MacArthur and the dismissal of Walter
                    Hickel combined would not equal the magnitude of public outburst over the Ballinger-Pinchot affair.</p>
            <p>If there is a shortcoming in this superlative evaluation of a man and his cause, it is not in the
                    research, writing, or interpretation. Yet the work would have been strengthened by a chapter
                    carefully describing scientific forest management. The author refers to elements and
                    characteristics, but an extensive treatment would have been desirable. Otherwise, this is a
                    miniature masterpiece of historical biography. More than anyone to date, Pinkett has argued
                    convincingly that despite many concerned predecessors, Gifford Pinchot deserves the title of founder
                    of <placeName>

                    </placeName> West. They are concerned with what happened to the people who were involved in the
                    frontier experience. Geography and environment are secondary, the authors find, to a faith in
                    material progress and a longstanding American ethnocentricity.</p>
            <p>The "urban dimension" of the American West is just beginning to receive analytical
                    scrutiny by scholars. In the lead and leading essay Earl Pomeroy argues that western cities served
                    as advanced bases for the exploitation and settlement of their hinterlands. Since the 1860s western
                    states have been more urban than the nation as a whole. Vernon Carstensen suggests that the salmon
                    fisheries and canning industry were very important to the urban development of the Pacific Coast
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> to Alaska. The technologically progressive salmon industry inspired the establishment
                    of auxiliary industries. George Anderson establishes the considerable role of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> City in the development of the Great Plains. Not only did banks, railroads, and mails
                    make it the dominant financial center of the region, but they gave the city a prominent place in the
                    formulation and functioning of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
            <p>Robert Johannsen puts Stephen A. Douglas in the forefront of the articulate political activists who
                    translated the American mission into reality. Virtually all of Douglas' legislative
                    accomplishments involved territorial expansion, encouragement of settlement, extension of organized
                    government, and the improvement of transportation and communication.</p>
            <p>Central in the westward movement was the problem of the Indian. Paul Gates shows through the
                    antecedents of the Dawes Act of 1887 that the principal aim was to eliminate the Indian hurdle to
                    white advance. Squaw men, whites married to Indians, were, as William Hagan shows, at the heart of
                    reservation politics and factionalism. Active and energetic, they used their peculiar status to
                    exploit both the Indians and their white benefactors. In the great upsurge of social reform in the
                    1840s efforts were made to better the status of the Indians that had been relocated westward as a
                    consequence of the removal policy. Francis Paul Prucha credits the Indian commissioners, agents, and
                    missionaries with laying a foundation upon which future reformers could build, despite the
                    undermining factors suggested by Hagan and Gates.</p>

                    English gentry, who looked upon the area as suitable for capital investment and as a
                    sportsman's paradise, and indigent farm laborers and urban unemployed, who believed <placeName>

                    </placeName> through promotional activity and regulatory legislation.</p>
            <p>The Spanish-Americans in the Southwest, according to Rodman Paul, were primarily people far down on
                    the social and economic ladders of their own societies. In the first half century under the American
                    flag, however, they proved resourceful and resilient in meeting the challenge of the acquisitive and
                    aggressive intruding groups of Anglo-Americans.</p>

            <p>The author of this work, an assistant professor at the City University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName>, set for himself the tasks of examining the responses of the British government to the
                    Confederate attempts to build a navy in British shipyards and of relating his findings to the
                    considerable body of scholarly studies in the field.</p>
            <p>Most of the book is devoted to an in-depth study of the problems encountered by the Confederates in
                    building the cruisers which took to sea, and the ironclads, including Number 61 in <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, which were never delivered to them. It is a story of legal wrangles, Confederate
                    artifices to circumvent the Neutrality Act, the counter pressures of the federal government, and the
                    consequent difficulties and embarrassments of the Palmerston government in coping with the
                    situation.</p>
            <p>The ingenuity of James D. Bulloch, who worked to build the navy against great odds, calls forth the
                    admiration of the author; but he doubts that even if Bulloch had been one hundred per cent
                    successful, it would have changed the outcome of the war. Not even the Laird Rams could have been
                    used with effect for very long. But many factors and conditions doomed Bulloch's major
                    efforts to failure including the ineptitude displayed by the Confederate government in administering
                    the limited funds it had available.</p>
            <p>In the British response to the Confederate shipbuilding program the writer finds a typical example of
                    British "muddling through." It would appear that the British government really had
                    no policy toward this form of private enterprise and simply took action on each <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-067-4-081"/> case as it arose according to the circumstances of the moment. One can
                    pity the poor law officers who so often had to clothe expediency with the garb of solemn legality!</p>
            <p>Carrying out his second task, the author includes a bibliographical essay of twenty-five pages, which
                    provides those interested in this field with an excellent and up to date reference. He makes wide
                    use of secondary sources, but he also draws upon a number of important British manuscript
                    collections to give added depth to his work.</p>
            <p>Although his approach would seem to be that of a specialist in American, rather than British,
                    history, the writer set his objectives; and, by and large, he worked toward them faithfully,
                    skillfully, and interestingly. The reviewer finds himself in general agreement with most of
                    Merli's conclusions not excluding his suggestion that Bulloch deserves a better memorial
                    than his uncared-for grave in Toxeth cemetery near Liverpool.</p>

                    Paper-bound, $1.50.) The maps in this atlas and their accompanying commentary emphasize
                    Lake County's historical development, population makeup, voting patterns, manufacturing
                    interests, and physical features. In the main they pertain to the last several decades, but several
                    belong to the nineteenth century. Some of them are much more readable than others, but they are
                    generally clear and usable. The author invites corrections regarding possible errors in this atlas
                    and suggestions concerning maps that readers believe would make desirable additions to a second
                    edition. The switch of Lake County voters from Republican to Democrat during this century is vividly
                    illustrated in maps concerning voting patterns. An interesting table shows the distribution within
                    the county and the relative importance of natives of other countries as of 1880. The Germans led
                    with an aggregate of 2,781 (including Prussians). Next came the Irish with 241, English with 189,
                    Canadians with 143, and Dutch with 114. No other group had as many as 50; there were only 49
                    Bohemians, 14 Italians, 11 Poles, 10 Austrians, and 1 each from <placeName>

               </placeName>, and the West Indies. Though lacking in this edition surely one or
                    two additional tables or maps are needed to show the impact of immigration from southern and eastern
                    Europe which began during the 1880s and 1890s. Furthermore, such an atlas should have tables or maps
                    which tell the story of the development of the Negro population.</p>

                    St. John's has had an important niche in its city and state since about 1840. Her account,
                    however, gives emphasis to the period since 1871 at which time the original structure of the present
                    building was dedicated. Sister Horan is to be commended for reliance on varied sources and the
                    substantial use of quotations which reflect the flavor and times represented. But, as too often
                    happens in such histories, the trees, and at times even their small branches, obscure the forest,
                    making it difficult to find and understand the important items, ideas, and achievements which
                    characterize St. John's. Moreover, it is disturbing to <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-067-4-083"/>
                    find such errors as the reference to the "Internal Improvement Bill of 1831" (p.

                    October 8, 1871, according to Angle, "destroyed practically every building in an area of
                    three and a third square miles in the heart of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Fire,’ is understatement: it was the most destructive fire in American
                    history" (p. 1). Apart from brief and helpful introductory comment by Angle, the awesome
                    destruction wrought by the holocaust is conveyed in letters by seven residents who observed it and
                    suffered its havoc and in numerous pictures of <placeName>

                    the claim of the bridge's proprietors to exclusive "privilege" the state
                    adopted a policy of "creative destruction," specifically to build a new, toll free
                    bridge alongside the old one. The Court of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney approved that policy by a
                    strict construction of the old bridge's charter and thus laid down an important
                    constitutional rule in behalf of innovation and enterprise. Kutler ably analyzes the economic and
                    legal impact of the decision with largely a favorable verdict despite this blow to exact justice and
                    to the ancient law. <hi rend="i">Maurice G. Baxter, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    volume brings together about a dozen articles, mainly essays, which Dorson has published during
                    roughly the last quarter century. They set forth his ideas about folklore, its changing status, and
                    how it should be studied. Unless this reviewer has misread and misunderstood Dorson, he here
                    contends that the study of local history and folklore are naturally and more closely linked together
                    than the study of history and folklore generally (see pages 138, 146 for instance). This thesis can
                    be debated pro and con, but Dorson intermingles his discussion of oral history and folklore in a
                    somewhat deceptive manner. He is thus less explicit than desirable concerning how folklore can make
                    significant contributions to the study of local history.</p>

                    Second edition. (Rutland, Vt.: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1971. Pp. xviii, 535. Illustrations,
                    bibliography, index. $10.00.) According to the author "this is the first book
                    devoted exclusively to a lowly domestic utensil, the spoon"; the emphasis is "on
                    the spoon at the apogee of its glory, that is, in that era when American makers of silver were
                    employing all their ingenuity to create lovely pieces of art, as souvenirs" (p. ix). After
                    a lively introduction about the spoon in literature, history, and lore Stutzenberger specifically
                    deals with 150 souvenir spoons providing many facts and legends which surround them. The subjects
                    vary from the <placeName>

                    and historical sites. The book will be of interest to collectors of spoons, and those members of a
                    younger generation who have received souvenir spoons from relatives should find this work a
                    fascinating recreation of the spirit which led to the manufacture and collecting of those spoons.
