					<head>AT ZEKESBURY.</head>
					<p>
						<hi rend="b">T</hi>HE little town, as I recall it, was of just enough dignity and dearth
						of the same to be an ordinary county seat in Indiana&quot; The Grand Old Hoosier
						State,&quot; as it was used to being howlingly referred to by the forensic stump orator
						from the old stand in the court-house yarda political campaign being the wildest delight
						that Zekesbury might ever hope to call its own.</p>
					<p>Through years the fitful happenings of the town and its vicinity went on the samethe
						same! Annually about one circus ventured in, and vanished, and was gone, even as a
						passing trumpet-blast; the usual rainy-season swelled the &quot;Crick,&quot; the
						driftage choking at &quot;the covered bridge,&quot; and backing water till the old road
						looked amphibious; and crowds of curious townsfolk straggled down to look upon the
						watery wonder, and lean awe-struck above it, and spit in it, and turn mutely home
						again.</p>
					<p>The usual formula of incidents peculiar to an uneventful town and its vicinity: The
						countryman from &quot;Jessup&apos;s Crossing,&quot; with the <pb id="VAA2379-012" n="14"
						/> cornstalk coffin-measure, loped into town, his steaming little gray-and-red-flecked
						&quot;roadster&quot; gurgitating, as it were, with that mysterious utterance that ever
						has commanded and ever must evoke the wonder and bewilderment of every boy. The
						small-pox rumor became prevalent betimes, and the subtle aroma of the assafoetida-bag
						permeated the graded schools &quot;from turret to foundation-stone;&quot; the still
						recurring expos of the poor-house management; the farm-hand, with the scythe across his
						shoulder, struck dead by lightning; the long-drawn quarrel between the rival editors
						culminating in one of them assaulting the other with a &quot;sidestick,&quot; and the
						other kicking the one down stairs and thenceward <hi rend="i">ad libitum</hi>; the
						tramp, suppositiously stealing a ride, found dead on the railroad; the grand jury
						returning a sensational indictment against a bar-tender <hi rend="i">non est</hi>; the
						Temperance outbreak; the &quot;Revival; &quot;the Church Festival; and the &quot;Free
						Lectures on Phrenology, and Marvels of Mesmerism,&quot; at the town hall. It was during
						the time of the last-mentioned sensation, and directly through this scientific
						investigation, that I came upon two of the town&apos;s most remarkable characters. And
						however meager my outline of them may prove, my material for the sketch is most accurate
						in every detail, <pb id="VAA2379-013" n="15"/> and no deviation from the cold facts of
						the case shall influence any line of my report.</p>
					<p>For some years prior to this odd experience I had been connected with a daily paper at
						the state capitol; and latterly a prolonged session of the legislature, where I
						specially reported, having told threateningly upon my health, I took both the advantage
						of a brief vacation, and the invitation of a young bachelor Senator, to get out of the
						city for awhile, and bask my respiratory organs in the revivifying rural air of
						Zekesburythe home of my new friend.</p>
					<p>&quot;It &apos;ll pay you to get out here,&quot; he said, cordially, meeting me at the
						little station, &quot;and I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve come, for you &apos;ll find no end
						of odd characters to amuse you.&quot; And under the very pleasant sponsorship of my
						senatorial friend, I was placed at once on genial terms with half the citizens of the
						little townfrom the shirt-sleeved nabob of the county office to the droll wag of the
						favorite loafing placethe rules and by-laws of which resort, by the way, being rudely
						charcoaled on the wall above the cutter&apos;s bench, and somewhat artistically
						culminating in an original dialectic legend which ran thus:</p>
					<lg>

					<p>And it was at this inviting rendezvous, two or three evenings following my arrival,
						that the general crowd, acting upon the random proposition of one of the boys, rose as a
						man and wended its hilarious way to the town hall.</p>
					<p>&quot;Phrenology,&quot; said the little, old, bald-headed lecturer and mesmerist,
						thumbing the egg-shaped head of a young man I remembered to have met that afternoon in
						some law office; &quot;Phrenology,&quot; repeated the professor&quot;or rather the <hi
							rend="i">term</hi> phrenologyis derived from two Greek words signifying <hi rend="i"
							>mind</hi> and <hi rend="i">discourse</hi>; hence we find embodied in
						phrenology-proper, the science of intellectual measurement, together with the capacity
						of intelligent communication of the varying mental forces and their flexibilities, etc.,
						&amp;c. The study, t hen, of phrenology is, to wholly simplify itis, I say, the general
						contemplation of the workings of the mind as made manifest through the certain
						corresponding depressions and protuberances of the human skull, when, of course, in a
						healthy state of action and development, <pb id="VAA2379-015" n="17"/> as we here find
						the conditions exemplified in the subject before us.&quot;</p>
					<p>Here the &quot;subject&quot; vaguely smiled.</p>
					<p>&quot;You recognize that mug, don&apos;t you?&quot; whispered my friend.
						&quot;It&apos;s that coruscating young ass, you know, Hedrickin Cummings&apos;
						officetrying to study law and literature at the same time, and tampering with &apos;The
						Monster that Annually,&apos; don&apos;t you know?where we found the two young students
						scuffling round the office, and smelling of peppermint?Hedrick, you know, and Sweeney.
						Sweeney, the slim chap, with the pallid face, and frog-eyes, and clammy hands! You
						remember I told you &apos;there was a pair of&apos; em?&apos; Well, they&apos;re up to
						something here to-night. Hedrick, there on the stage in front; and Sweeneydon&apos;t you
						see?with the gang on the rear seats.</p>
					<p>&quot;Phrenologyagain,&quot; continued the lecturer, &quot;is, we may say, a species of
						mental geography, as it were; whichby a study of the skullleads also to a study of the
						brain within, even as geology naturally follows the initial contemplation of the
						earth&apos;s surface. The brain, thurfur, or intellectual retort, as we may say,
						natively exerts a molding influence on the skull contour; thurfur is the expert in
						phrenology most readily enabled to accurately locate the multitudinous intellectual
						forces, and <pb id="VAA2379-016" n="18"/> most exactingly estimate, as well, the sequent
						character of each subject submitted to his scrutiny. As, in the example before asa young
						man, doubtless well known in your midst, though, I may say, an entire stranger to
						myselfI venture to disclose some characteristic trends and tendencies, as indicated by
						this phrenological depression and development of the skull-proper, as later we will
						show, through the mesmeric condition, the accuracy of our mental diagnosis.&quot;</p>
					<p>Throughout the latter part of this speech my friend nudged me spasmodically, whispering
						something which was jostled out of intelligent utterance by some inward spasm of
						laughter.</p>
					<p>&quot;In this head,&quot; said the Professor, straddling his malleable fingers across
						the young man&apos;s bumpy brow&quot;In this head we find Ideality largeabnormally
						large, in fact; thurby indicatingtaken in conjunction with a like development of the
						perceptive qualitieslanguage following, as well, in the prominent eyethurby indicating,
						I say, our subject as especially endowed with a love for the beautifulthe sublimethe
						elevatingthe refined and delicatethe lofty and superbin nature, and in all the
						sublimated attributes of the human heart and beatific soul. In fact, we find this young
						man possessed of such <pb id="VAA2379-017" n="19"/> natural gifts as would befit him for
						the exalted career of the sculptor, the actor, the artist, or the poetany ideal calling;
						in fact, any calling but a practical, matter-of-fact vocation; though in poetry he would
						seem to best succeed.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said my friend, seriously, &quot;he&apos;s <hi rend="i">feeling</hi>
						for the boy!&quot; Then laughingly: &quot;Hedrick <hi rend="i">has</hi> written some
						rhymes for the county papers, and Sweeney once introduced him, at an Old Settlers&apos;
						Meeting, as &apos;The Best Poet in Center Township,&apos; and never cracked a smile!
						Always after each other that way, but the best friends in the world. <hi rend="i"
							>Sweeney</hi>&apos;<hi rend="i">s</hi> strong suit is elocution. He has a native
						ability that way by no means ordinary, but even that gift he abuses and distorts simply
						to produce grotesque, and oftentimes ridiculous effects. For instance, nothing more
						delights him than to &apos;lothfully &apos; consent to answer a request, at The Mite
						Society, some evening, for &apos;an appropriate selection,&apos; and then, with an
						elaborate introduction of the same, and an exalted tribute to the refined genius of the
						author. proceed with a most gruesome rendition of &apos;Alonzo The Brave and The Fair
						Imogene,&apos; in a way to coagulate the blood and curl the hair of his fair listeners
						with abject terror. Pale as a corpse, you <pb id="VAA2379-018" n="20"/> know, and with
						that cadaverous face, lit with those malignant-looking eyes, his slender figure, and his
						long, thin legs and arms and hands, and his whole diabolical talent and adroitness
						brought into playwhy, I want to say to you, it&apos;s enough to scare &apos;em to death!
						Never a smile from him, though, till he and Hedrick are safe out into the night
						againthen, of course, they hug each other and howl over it like Modocs! But pardon; I
						&apos;m interrupting the lecture. Listen.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;A lack of continuity, however,&quot; continued the Professor, &quot;and an undue
						love of approbation, would, measurably, at least, tend to retard the young man&apos;s
						progress toward the consummation of any loftier ambition, I fear; yet as we have
						intimated, if the subject were appropriately educated to the need&apos;s demand, he
						could doubtless produce a high order of both prose and poetryespecially the latterthough
						he could very illy bear being laughed at for his pains.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;He&apos;s dead wrong there,&quot; said my friend; &quot;Hedrick enjoys being
						laughed at; he&apos;s used to itgets fat on it!&quot;</p>
					<p>Is fond of his friends,&quot;continued the Professor and the heartier they are the
						better; might even be convivially inclinedif so temptedbut prudentin a degree,&quot;
						loiteringly <pb id="VAA2379-019" n="21"/> concluded the speaker, as though unable to
						find the exact bump with which to bolster up the last named attribute.</p>
					<p>The subject blushed vividlymy friend&apos;s right eyelid dropped, and there was a
						notice-able, though elusive sensation throughout the audience.</p>
					<p>&quot;<hi rend="i">But!</hi>&quot; said the Professor, explosively, &quot;selecting a
						directly opposite subject, in conjunction with the study of the one before us [turning
						to the group at the rear of the stage and beckoning], we may find a newer interest in
						the practical comparison of these subjects side by side.&quot; And the Professor pushed
						a very pale young man into position.</p>
					<p>&quot;Sweeney!&quot; whispered my friend, delightedly; &quot;now look out!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;In <hi rend="i">this</hi> subject,&quot; said the Professor, &quot;we find the
						practical business head. Squarethough smalla trifle light at the base, in fact; but well
						balanced at the important points at least; thoughtful eyeswideawakecraftyquickrestlessa
						policy eye, though not denoting languageunless, perhaps, mere business forms and direct
						statements.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Fooled again!&quot; whispered my friend; &quot;and I&apos;m afraid the old man
						will fail to nest out the fact also that Sweeney is the cold-bloodedest guyer on the
						face of the earth, and <pb id="VAA2379-020" n="22"/> with more diabolical resources than
						a prosecuting attorney; the Professor ought to know this, too, by this timefor these
						same two chaps have been visiting the old man in his room at the hotel;that&apos;s what
						I was trying to tell you awhile ago. The old sharp thinks he&apos;s &apos; playing&apos;
						the boys, is my idea; but it&apos;s the other way, or I lose my guess.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Now, under the mesmeric influenceif the two subjects will consent to its
						administration,&quot; said the Professor, after some further tedious preamble, &quot;we
						may at once determine the fact of my assertions, as will he proved by their action while
						in this peculiar state.&quot; here some apparent remonstrance was met with from both
						subjects, though amicably overcome by the Professor first manipulating the stolid brow
						and pallid front of the imperturbable Sweeneyafter which the same mysterious ordeal was
						lothfully submitted to by Hedrickthough a noticeably longer time was consumed in
						securing his final loss of self-control. At last, however, this curious phenomenon was
						presented, and there before us stood the two swaying figures, the heads dropped back,
						the lifted hands, with thumb and finger-tips pressed lightly together, the eyelids
						languid and half closed, and the features, in appearance, wan and humid.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-021" n="23"/>
					<p>&quot;Now, sir!&quot; said the Professor, leading the limp Sweeney forward, and
						addressing him in a quick, sharp tone of voice.&quot; Now, sir, you area great
						contractorown large factories, and with untold business interests. Just look out there!
						[pointing out across the expectant audience] look there, and see the countless minions
						toiling servilely at your dread mandates. And yetha! ha! See! see!They recognize the
						avaricious greed that would thus grind them in the very dust; they see, alas! they see
						themselves half-clothedhalf-fed, that you may glut your coffers. Half-starved, they
						listen to the wail of wife and babe, and, with eyes upraised in prayer, they see <hi
							rend="i">you</hi> rolling by in gilded coach, and swathed in silk attire. Butha!
						again! Looklook! they are rising in revolt against you! Speak to them before too late!
						Appeal to themquell them with the promise of the just advance of wages they
						demand!&quot;</p>
					<p>The limp figure of Sweeney took on something of a stately and majestic air. With a
						graceful and commanding gesture of the hand, he advanced a step or two; then, after a
						pause of some seconds duration, in which the lifted face grew paler, as it seemed, and
						the eyes a denser black, he said:</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-022" n="24"/>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;But yesterday I looked away</l>
						<l n="2">O&apos;er happy lands, where sunshine lay</l>
						<l n="3">In golden blots, Inlaid with spots</l>
						<l n="4">Of shade and wild forget-me-nots.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>The voice was low, but clear, and ever musical. The Professor started at the strange
						utterance, looked extremely confused, and, as the boisterous crowd criedHear, hear!he
						motioned the subject to continue, with some gasping comment interjected, which, if
						audible, would have run thus:My God! It&apos;s an inspirational poem! <q
							direct="unspecified">
							<lg>
								<l n="1">&quot;My head was fair</l>
								<l n="2">With flaxen hair&quot;</l>
							</lg>
						</q> resumed the subject.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yoop-ee!&quot; yelled an irreverent auditor.</p>
					<p>&quot;Silence! silence!&quot; commanded the excited Professor in a hoarse whisper;
						then, turning enthusiastically to the subject-Go on, young man! Go on!-&apos; <hi
							rend="i">Thy head was fair with flaxen hair-&apos;&quot;</hi>
					</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;My head was fair</l>
						<l n="2">With flaxen hair,</l>
						<l n="3">And fragent breezes, faint and rare, And warm with drouth</l>
						<l n="4">From out the south,</l>
						<l n="5">Blew all my curls across my mouth.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA2379-023" n="25"/>
					<p>The speaker&apos;s voice, exquisitely modulated, yet resonant as the twang of a harp,
						now seemed of itself to draw and hold each listener; while a certain extravagance of
						gesticulationa fantastic movement of both form and featureseemed very near akin to
						fascination. And on flowed on the curious utterance:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;And, cool and sweet,</l>
						<l n="2">My naked feet</l>
						<l n="3">Found dewy pathways through the wheat;</l>
						<l n="4">And out again</l>
						<l n="5">Where, down the lane,</l>
						<l n="6">The dust was dimpled with the rain.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>In the pause following there was a breathlessness almost painful. The poem went on: <q
							direct="unspecified">
							<lg>
								<l n="1">&quot;But yesterday</l>
								<l n="2">I heard the lay</l>
								<l n="3">Of summer birds, when I, as they</l>
								<l n="4">With breast and wing,</l>
								<l n="5">All quivering</l>
								<l n="6">With life and love, could only sing.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l n="7">&quot;My head was leant,</l>
								<l n="8">Where, with It, blent</l>
								<l n="9">A maiden r her instrument;</l>
								<l n="10">While all the night,</l>
								<l n="11">From vale to height,</l>
								<l n="12">Was filled with echoes of delight.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l n="13">&quot;And all our dreams</l>
								<l n="14">Were lit with gleams</l>
								<pb id="VAA2379-024" n="26"/>
								<l n="15">Of that lost land of reedy streams,</l>
								<l n="16">Along whose brim</l>
								<l n="17">Forever swim</l>
								<l n="18">Pan&apos;s lilies, laughing up at him.&quot;</l>
							</lg>
						</q> And still the inspired singer held rapt sway.</p>
					<p>&quot;It is wonderful!&quot; I whispered, under breath.</p>
					<p>&quot;Of course it is!&quot; answered my friend. &quot;But listen; there is
						more:&quot;</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;But yesterday! . . . .</l>
						<l n="2">O blooms of May,</l>
						<l n="3">And summer rosesWhere-away? O stars above;</l>
						<l n="4">And lips of love,</l>
						<l n="5">And all the honeyed sweets thereof!</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="6">&quot;O lad and lass,</l>
						<l n="7">And orchard-pass,</l>
						<l n="8">And briared lane, and daisied grass! O gleam and gloom,</l>
						<l n="9">And woodland bloom,</l>
						<l n="10">And breesy breaths of all perfume!</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="11">&quot;No more for me</l>
						<l n="12">Or mine shall be</l>
						<l n="13">Thy rapturessave in memory,</l>
						<l n="14">No moreno more</l>
						<l n="15">Till through the Door</l>
						<l n="16">Of Glory gleam the days of yore.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>This was the evident conclusion of the remarkable utterance, and the Professor was
						impetuously fluttering his hands about the <pb id="VAA2379-025" n="27"/> subject&apos;s
						upward-staring eyes, stroking his temples, and snapping his fingers in his face.</p>
					<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sweeney, as he stood suddenly awakened, and grinning in an
						idiotic way, &quot;how did the old thing work?&quot; And it was in the consequent
						hilarity and loud and long applause, perhaps, that the Professor was relieved from the
						explanation of this rather astounding phenomenon of the idealistic workings of a purely
						practical brainor, as my impious friend scoffed the incongruity later, in a particularly
						withering allusion, as the &quot;blank-blanked fallacy, don&apos;t you know, of staying
						the hunger of a howling mob by feeding &apos;em on Spring poetry!&quot;</p>
					<p>The tumult of the audience did not cease even with the retirement of Sweeney, and cries
						of &quot;Hedrick! Hedrick! &quot;only subsided with the Professor&apos;s high-keyed
						announcement that the subject was even then endeavoring to make himself heard, but could
						not until utter quiet was restored, adding the further appeal that the young man had
						already been a long time under the mesmeric spell, and ought not be so detained for an
						unnecessary period. &quot;See,&quot; he concluded, with an assuring wave of the hand
						toward the subject, &quot;see; he is about to address you. Now, quiet!utter quiet, if
						you please!&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-026" n="28"/>
					<p>&quot;Great heavens!&quot; exclaimed my friend, stiflingly; &quot;Just look at the boy!
						Get onto that position for a poet! Even Sweeney has fled from the sight of
						him!&quot;</p>
					<p>And truly, too, it was a grotesque pose the young man had assumed; not wholly
						ridiculous either, since the dwarfed position he had settled into seemed more a genuine
						physical condition than an affected one. The head, back-tilted, and sunk between the
						shoulders, looked abnormally large, while the features of the face appeared peculiarly
						child-likeespecially the eyeswakeful and wide apart, and very bright, yet very mild and
						very artless; and the drawn and cramped outline of the legs and feet, and of the arms
						and hands, even to the shrunken, slender-looking fingers, all combined to most
						strikingly convey to the pained senses the fragile frame and pixey figure of some
						pitiably afflicted child, unconscious altogether of the pathos of its own deformity.</p>
					<p>&quot;Now, mark the kuss, Horatio!&quot; gasped my friend.</p>
					<p>At first the speaker&apos;s voice came very low, and somewhat piping, too, and brokenan
						eerie sort of voice it was, of brittle and erratic <hi rend="i">timbre</hi> and undulant
						inflection. Yet it was beautiful. It had the ring of childhood in it, <pb
							id="VAA2379-027" n="29"/> though the ring was not pure golden, and at times fell
						echoless. The <hi rend="i">spirit</hi> of its utterance was always clear and pure and
						crisp and cheery as the twitter of a bird, and yet forever ran an undercadence through
						it like a low-pleading prayer. Half garrulously, and like a shallow brook might brawl
						across a shelvy bottom, the rhythmic little changeling thus began:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;I&apos;m thist a little crippled boy, an&apos; never goin&apos; to
							grow</l>
						<l n="2">An&apos; git a great big man at all!&apos;cause Aunty told me so.</l>
						<l n="3">When I was thist a baby onc&apos;t I failed out of the bed</l>
						<l n="4">An&apos; got &apos;The Curv&apos;ture of the Spine&apos;&apos;at&apos;s what
							the Doctor said.</l>
						<l n="5">I never had no Mother nenfer my Pa wooed away</l>
						<l n="6">An&apos; dass n&apos;t come back here no more&apos;cause he was drunk one
							day</l>
						<l n="7">An&apos; stubbed a was In thish-ere town, an&apos; could n&apos;t pay his
							fine!</l>
						<l n="8">An&apos; nen my Ma she diedan&apos; I got &apos;Curv&apos;ture of the
							Spine!&apos;&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>A few titterings from the younger people in the audience marked the opening stanza,
						while a certain restlessness, and a changing to more attentive positions seemed the
						general tendency. The old Professor, in the mean-time, had sunk into one of the empty
						chairs. The speaker went on with more gaiety:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;I&apos;m nine years old! An&apos; you can&apos;t guess how much I weigh,
							I bet!</l>
						<pb id="VAA2379-028" n="30"/>
						<l n="2">Last birthday I weighed thirty-three!An&apos; I weigh thirty yet!</l>
						<l n="3">I&apos;m awful little fer my sizeI&apos;m purt&apos; nigh littler &apos;an</l>
						<l n="4">Some babies is!an&apos; neighbors all calk me &apos;The Little Man!&apos;</l>
						<l n="5">An&apos; Doc one time he laughed an&apos; said: &apos;I &apos;spect, first
							thing you know,</l>
						<l n="6">You&apos;ll have a little spike-tail coat an&apos; travel with a
							show!&apos;</l>
						<l n="7">An&apos; nen I laughedtill I looked round an&apos; Aunty was a-cryin&apos;</l>
						<l n="8">Sometimes she acts like that, &apos;cause I got &apos;Curv&apos; ture of the
							Spine!&apos;&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>Just in front of me a great broad-shouldered countryman, with a rainy smell in his
						cumbrous overcoat, cleared his throat vehemently, looked startled at the sound, and
						again settled forward, his weedy chin resting on the knuckles of his hands as they
						tightly clutched the seat before him. And it was like being taken into a childish
						confidence as the quaint speech continued:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;I setwhile Aunty&apos;s washin&apos;on my little long-leg stool,</l>
						<l n="2">An&apos; watch the little boys an&apos; girls &apos;a-skippin&apos; by to
							school;</l>
						<l n="3">An&apos; I peek on the winder, an&apos; holler out an&apos; say:</l>
						<l n="4">Who wants to fight The Little Man &apos;at dares you all todays?</l>
						<l n="5">An&apos; nen the boys climbs on the fence, an&apos; little girls peeks
							through,</l>
						<l n="6">An&apos; they all says: Cause you &apos;re so big, you think we&apos;re
							&apos;feared o&apos; you!</l>
						<pb id="VAA2379-029" n="31"/>
						<l n="7">An&apos; nen they yell, an&apos; shake their fist at me, like I shake mine</l>
						<l n="8">They &apos;re thist in fun, you know, &apos;cause I got &apos;Curv&apos;ture of
							the Spine!&apos;&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>&quot;Well,&quot; whispered my friend, with rather odd irrelevance, I thought, &quot;of
						course you see through the scheme of the fellows by this time, do n&apos;t
						you?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;I see nothing,&quot; said I, most earnestly, &quot;but a poor little wisp of a
						child that makes me love him so I dare not think of his dying soon, as he surely must!
						There; listen!&quot; And the plaintive gaiety of the homely poem ran on:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;At evening, when the ironin&apos;s done, an&apos; Aunty&apos;s fixed the
							fire,</l>
						<l n="2">An&apos; filled an&apos; it the lamp, an&apos; trimmed the wick an&apos; turned

						<l n="3">An&apos; fetched the wood all in fer night, an&apos; locked the kitchen

						<l n="4">An&apos; stuffed the ole crack where the wind blows in up through the floor</l>

					</lg>
					<p>&quot;Look!&quot; whispered my friend, touching me with his elbow. &quot;Look at the
						Professor!&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-030" n="32"/>
					<p>&quot;Look at everybody!&quot; said I. And the artless little voice went on again half
						quaveringly:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;But Aunty&apos;s all so childish-like on my account, you see,</l>
						<l n="2">I&apos;m &apos;most afeared she&apos;ll be took downan&quot;at&apos;s what

							n&apos; fine,</l>
						<l n="8">They&apos;s nary angel &apos;bout the place with;&apos;Curvture&apos; of the
							Spincl!&apos;&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>The old Professor&apos;s face was in his hand-kerchief; so was my friend&apos;s in his;
						and so was mine in mine, as even now my pen drops and I reach for it again.</p>
					<p>I half regret joining the mad party that had gathered an hour later in the old
						law-office where these two graceless characters held almost nightly revel, the
						instigators and conniving hosts of a reputed banquet whose <hi rend="i">menu&apos;s</hi>
						range confined itself to herrings, or &quot;blind robins,&quot; dried beef, and cheese,
						with crackers, gingerbread, and sometimes pie; the whole washed down with anything
						but</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-031" n="33"/>
					<lg>
						<l n="1" rend="ti-1">&quot;Wines that heaven knows when</l>
						<l n="2">Had sucked the fire of some forgotten sun,</l>
						<l n="3">And kept it through a hundred years of gloom</l>
						<l n="4">Still glowing in a heart of ruby.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>But the affair was memorable. The old Professor was himself lured into it, and loudest
						in his praise of Hedrick&apos;s realistic art; and I yet recall him at the orgie&apos;s
						height, excitedly repulsing the continued slurs and insinuations of the clammy-handed
						Sweeney, who, still contending against the old man&apos;s fulsome praise of his more
						fortunate rival, at last openly declared that Hedrick <hi rend="i">was not a</hi> poet,
							<hi rend="i">not a</hi> genius, and in no way worthy to be classed in the same breath

						<hi rend="b">J</hi>OHN B. McKINNEY, Attorney and J Counselor at Law, as his sign read,
						was, for many reasons, a fortunate man. For many other reasons he was not. He was
						chiefly fortunate in being, as certain opponents often strove to witheringly designate
						him, &quot;the son of his father,&quot; since that sound old gentleman was the
						wealthiest farmer in that section, with but one son and heir to, in tine, supplant him
						in the role of &quot;county god,&quot; and haply perpetuate the prouder title of
						&quot;the biggest tax-payer on the assessment list.&quot; And this fact, too, fortunate
						as it would seem, was doubtless the indirect occasion of a liberal percentage of all
						John&apos;s misfortunes. From his earliest school-days in the little town, up to his
						tardy graduation from a distant college, the influence of his father&apos;s wealth
						invited his procrastination, humored its results, encouraged the laxity of his ambition,
						&quot;and even now,&quot; as John used, in bitter irony, to put it, &quot;it is aiding
						and abetting me in the ostensible practice of my chosen profession, a listless, aimless
						undetermined man of forty, and a confirmed <pb id="VAA2379-053" n="58"/> bachelor at
						that?&quot; At the utterance of this self-depreciating statement, John generally jerked
						his legs clown from the top of his desk; and, rising and kicking his chair back to the
						wall, he would stump around his littered office till the manilla carpet steamed with
						dust. Then he would wildly break away, seeking refuge either in the open street, or in
						his room at the old-time tavern, The Eagle House, &quot;where,&quot; he would say,
						&quot;I have lodged and boarded, I do solemnly asseverate, for a long, unbroken,
						middle-aged eternity of ten years, and can yet assert, in the words of the more
						fortunately-dying Webster, that &apos;I still live!&apos;</p>
					<p>Extravagantly satirical as he was at times, John had always an indefinable drollery
						about him that made him agreeable company to his friends, at least; and such an admiring
						friend he had constantly at hand in the person of Bert Haines. Both were Bohemians in
						natural tendency, and, though John w as far in Bert&apos;s advance in point of age, he
						found the young man &quot;just the kind of a fellow to have around;&quot; while Bert, in
						turn, held his senior in profound esteemlooked up to him, in fact, and in even his
						eccentricities strove to pattern after him. And so it was, when summer days were dull
						and tedious, these two could muse and doze the hours away together; and when the <pb
							id="VAA2379-054" n="59"/> nights were long, and dark, and deep, and beautiful, they
						could drift out in the noon-light of the stars, and with&apos;&apos; the soft
						complaining flute&quot; and &quot;warbling lute,&quot; &quot;lay the pipes,&quot; as
						John would say, for their enduring popularity with the girls! And it was immediately
						subsequent to one of these romantic excursions, when the belated pair, at two
						o&apos;clock in the morning, had skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel, and gained
						John&apos;s room, with nothing more serious happening than Bert falling over a trunk and
						smashing his guitar,just after such a night of romance and adventure it was that, in the
						seclusion of john&apos;s room, Bert had something of especial import to communicate.</p>
					<p>&quot;Mack,&quot; he said, as that worthy anathematized a spiteful match, and then
						sucked his finger.</p>
					<p>&quot;Blast the ail-fired old torch!&quot; said John, wrestling with the lamp-flue, and
						turning on a welcome flame at last. &quot;Well, you said &apos;Macke!&apos; Why do
						n&apos;t you go on? And don&apos;t bahv1 at the top of your lungs, either. You&apos;ve
						already succeeded in waking every boarder in the house with that guitar, and you want to
						make amends now by letting them go to sleep again!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;But my dear fellow,&quot; said Bert, with <pb id="VAA2379-055" n="60"/> forced
						calmness, &quot;you&apos;re the fellow that&apos;s making all the noiseand&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Why, you howling dervish!&quot; interrupted John, with a feigned air of pleased
						surprise and admiration.&quot; But let&apos;s drop controversy. Throw the fragments of
						your guitar in the wood-box there, and proceed with the opening proposition.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;What I was going to say was this,&quot; said Bert, with a half-desperate
						enunciation; &quot;I&apos;m getting tired of this way of livingclean, dead-tired, and
						fagged out, and sick of the whole artificial business!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; exclaimed John, with a towering disdain, &quot;you need n&apos;t
						go any further! I know just what malady is throttling you. It&apos;s reformreform!
						You&apos;re going to&apos; turn over a new leaf,&apos; and all that, and sign the
						pledge, and quit cigars, and go to work, and pay your debts, and gravitate back into
						Sunday-School, where you can make love to the preacher&apos;s daughter under the guise
						of religion, and desecrate the sanctity of the innermost pale of the church by
						confessions at Class of your thorough conversion!&apos; Oh, you&apos;re going
						to&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;No, but I&apos;m going to do nothing of the sort,&quot; interrupted Bert,
						resentfully.&quot; What I <pb id="VAA2379-056" n="61"/> meanif you &apos;11 let me
						finishis, I &apos;m getting too old to be eternally undignifying myself with this &apos;
						singing of midnight strains under Bonnybell&apos;s window panes,&apos; and too old to be
						keeping myself in constant humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing up of
						old guitars, together with the breakage of the same, and the general wear-and-tear on a
						constitution that is slowly being sapped to its foundations by exposure in the night-air
						and the dew.&quot; &quot;And while you receive no further compensation in return,&quot;
						said John, &quot;than, perhaps, the coy turning up of a lamp at an upper casement where
						the jasmine climbs; or an exasperating patter of invisible palms; or a huge dank wedge
						of fruit-cake shoved at you by the old man, through a crack in the door.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, and I&apos;m going to have my just reward is what I mean &quot;said Bert
						&quot;and exchange the lover&apos;s life for the benedict&apos;s. Going to hunt out a
						good, sensible girl and marry her.&quot; And as the young man concluded this desperate
						avowal he jerked the bow of his cravat into a hard knot, kicked his hat under the bed,
						and threw himself on the sofa like an old suit</p>
					<p>John stared at him with absolute compassion. <pb id="VAA2379-057" n="62"/> &quot;Poor
						devil,&quot; he said, half musingly, &quot;I know just how he feels</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&apos;Ring in the wind his wedding chimes,</l>
						<l n="2" rend="ti-1">Smile, villagers, at every door;</l>
						<l n="3">Old church-yards stuffed with buried crimes,</l>
						<l n="4" rend="ti-1">Be clad in sunshine o&apos;er and o&apos;er.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>&quot;Oh, here!&quot; exclaimed the wretched Bert, jumping to his feet; &quot;let up on
						that dismal recitative. It would make a dog howl to hear that!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Then you &apos;let up&apos; on that suicidal talk of marrying,&quot; replied
						John, &quot;and all that harangue of incoherency about your growing old. Why, my dear
						fellow, you &apos;re at least a dozen years my junior, and look at me!&quot; and John
						glanced at himself in the glass with a feeble pride, noting the gray sparseness of his
						side-hair, and its plaintive dearth on top. &quot;Of course I &apos;ve got to
						admit,&quot; he continued, &quot;that my hair is gradually evaporating; but for all
						that, I &apos;m &apos; still in the ring,&apos; do n&apos;t you know; as young in
						society, for the matter of that, as yourself! And this is just the reason why I do
						n&apos;t want you to blight every prospect in your life by marrying at your
						ageespecially a womanI mean the kind of woman you&apos;d be sure to fancy at your
						age.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Did n&apos;t I say &apos; a good, sensible girl&apos; was the kind I had
						selected?&quot; Bert remonstrated.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-058" n="63"/>
					<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed John, &quot;you&apos;ve selected her, then?and without one
						word to me!&quot; he ended, rebukingly.</p>
					<p>&quot;Well, hang it all I &quot;said Bert, impatiently; &quot;I knew how <hi rend="i"
							>you</hi> were, and just how you &apos;d talk me out of it; and I made up my mind that
						for once, at least, I &apos;d follow the dictations of a heart thathowever capricious in
						youthful frivoltiesshould beat, in manhood, loyal to itself and loyal to its own
						affinity.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Go it! Fire away! Farewell, vain world!&quot; exclaimed the excited
						John.&quot;Trade your soul off for a pair of ear-bobs and a button-hooka hank of jute
						hair and a box of lily-white! I&apos;ve buried not less than ten old chums this way, and
						here&apos;s another nominated for the tomb.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;But you&apos;ve got no <hi rend="i">reason</hi> about you,&quot; began
						Bert,&quot;I want to &quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;And so do <hi rend="i">I</hi> &apos;want to,&apos;&quot; broke in John,
						finally,&quot;I want to get some sleep.So &apos; register&apos; and come to bed.And lie
						up on edge, too, when you <hi rend="i">do</hi> come&apos;cause this old
						catafalque-of-a-bed is just about as narrow as your views of single blessedness! Peace!
						Not another word! Pile in! Pile in! I&apos;m three-parts sick, anyhow, and I want
						rest!&quot; And very truly he spoke.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-059" n="64"/>
					<p>It was a bright morning when the slothful John was aroused by a long, vociferous
						pounding on the door. He started up in bed to find himself alonethe victim of his
						wrathful irony having evidently risen and fled away while his pitiless tormentor
						slept&quot; Doubtless to at once accomplish that nefarious intent as set forth by his
						unblushing confession of last night, &quot;mused the miserable John. And he ground his
						fingers in the corners of his swollen eyes, and leered grimly in the glass at the
						feverish orbs, blood-shotten, blurred and aching.</p>
					<p>The pounding on the door continued. John looked at his watch; it was only 8
						o&apos;clock.</p>
					<p>&quot;Hi, there!&quot; he called viciously. &quot;What do you mean, anyhow?&quot; he
						went on, elevating his voice again; &quot;shaking a man out of bed when he&apos;s just
						dropping into his first sleep?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;I mean that you &apos;re going to get up; that&apos;s what! &quot;replied a firm
						female voice. &quot;It&apos;s 8 o&apos;clock, and I want to put your room in order; and
						I&apos;m not going to wait all day about it, either! Get up and go down to your
						breakfast, and let me have the room!&quot; And the clamor at the door was industriously
						renewed</p>
					<p>&quot;Say!&quot; called John, querulously, hurrying on his clothes, &quot;Say!
						you!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;There&apos;s no &apos; say &apos; about it I&quot; responded <pb id="VAA2379-060"
							n="65"/> the determined voice: &quot;I&apos;ve heard about you and your ways around
						this house, and I&apos;m not going to put up with it! You&apos;ll not lie in bed till
						high noon when I&apos;ve got to keep your room in proper order!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh ho!&quot; bawled John, intelligently: &quot;reckon you&apos;re the new
						invasion here? Doubtless you&apos;re the girl that&apos;s been hanging up the new
						window-blinds that wo n&apos;t roll, and disguising the pillows with clean slips, and
						&apos;hennin&apos; round among my books and papers on the table here, and ageing me
						generally till I do n&apos;t know my own handwriting by the time I find it! Oh, yes! you
						&apos;re going to revolutionize things here; you&apos;re going to introduce promptness,
						and system, and order. See you&apos;ve even filled the wash-pitcher and tucked two
						starched towels through the handle. Have n&apos;t got any tin towels, have you? I rather
						like this new soap, too! So solid and durable, you know; warranted not to raise a
						lather. Might as well wash one&apos;s hands with a door-knob!&quot; And as John&apos;s
						voice grumbled <hi rend="i">away</hi> into the sullen silence again, the determined
						voice without responded: &quot;Oh, you can growl away to your heart&apos;s content, Mr.
						McKinney, but I want you to distinctly understand that I&apos;m not going to humor you
						in any of your old bachelor, sluggardly, slovenly ways, and whims <pb id="VAA2379-061"
							n="66"/> and notions. And I want you to understand, too, that I &apos;m not hired help
						in this house, nor a chambermaid, nor anything of the kind. I &apos;m the landlady here;
						and I &apos;ll give you just ten minutes more to get down to your break-fast, or you
						&apos;ll not get anythat&apos;s all!&quot; And as the reversed cuff John was in the act
						of buttoning slid from his wrist and rolled under the dresser, he heard a stiff rustling
						of starched muslin flouncing past the door, and the quick italicized patter of
						determined gaiters down the hall.</p>
					<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said John to the bright-faced boy in the hotel office, a half
						hour later. &quot;It seems the house here&apos;s been changing hands again.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the boy, closing the cigar case, and handing him a lighted
						match. &quot;Well, the new landlord, whoever he is,&quot; continued John, patronizingly,
						&quot;is a good one. Leastwise, he knows what&apos;s good to eat, and how to serve
						it.&quot;</p>
					<p>The boy laughed timidly,&quot;It aint a &apos;land-lord,&apos; thoughit&apos;s a
						landlady; it&apos;s my mother.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said John, dallying with the change the boy had pushed toward him.
						&quot;Your mother, eh?&quot; And where&apos;s your father?</p>
					<p>&quot;He&apos;s dead,&quot; said the boy.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-062" n="67"/>
					<p>&quot;And what&apos;s this for?&quot; abruptly asked John, examining his change.</p>
					<p>&quot;That&apos;s your change,&quot; said the boy: &quot;You got three for a quarter,
						and gave me a half.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Well, <hi rend="i">you</hi> just keep it,&quot; said John, sliding back the
						change. &quot;It&apos;s for good luck, you know, my boy. Same as drinking your long life
						and prosperity. And, Oh yes, by the way, you may tell your mother I &apos;ll have a
						friend to dinner with me to-day.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, sir, and thank you, sir,&quot; said the beaming boy.</p>
					<p>&quot;Handsome boy!&quot; mused John, as he walked down street. &quot;Takes that from
						his father, though, I &apos;11 wager my existence!&quot;</p>
					<p>Upon his office desk John found a hastily written note. It was addressed in the
						well-known hand of his old chum. He eyed the missive apprehensively, and there was a
						positive pathos in his voice as he said aloud, &quot;It&apos;s our divorce. I feel
						it!&quot; The note, headed, &quot;At the Office, 4 in Morning,&quot; ran like this: <text>

					<p>&quot;Heavens!&quot; exclaimed John, stifling the note in his hand and stalking
						tragically around the room. &quot;Can it be possible that I have nursed a frozen viper?
						An ingrate? A wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing? An orang-outang in gent&apos;s
						furnishings?</p>
					<p>&quot;Was you callin&apos; me, sir?&quot; asked a voice at the door. It was the
						janitor.</p>
					<p>&quot;No! &quot;thundered John; &quot;Quit my sight! get out of my way! No, no,
						Thompson, I don&apos;t mean that,&quot; he called after him. &quot;Here&apos;s a half
						dollar for you, and I want you to lock up <pb id="VAA2379-064" n="69"/> the office, and
						tell anybody what wants to see me that I&apos;ve been set upon and sacked and
						assassinated in cold blood; and I &apos;ve fled to my father&apos;s in the country, and
						am lying there in the convulsions of dissolution, babbling of green fields and running
						brooks, and thirsting for the life of every woman that comes in gunshot!&quot; And then,
						more like a confirmed in-valid than a man in the strength and pride of his prime, he
						crept down into the street again, and thence back to his hotel.</p>
					<p>Dejectedly and painfully climbing to his room, he encountered, on the landing above, a
						little woman in a jaunty dusting-cap and a trim habit of crisp muslin. He tried to evade
						her, but in vain. She looked him squarely in the faceoccasioning him the dubious
						impression of either needing shaving very badly, or having egg-stains on his chin.</p>
					<p>&quot;You&apos;re the gentleman in No. 11, I believe?&quot; she said.</p>
					<p>He nodded confusedly.</p>
					<p>&quot;Mr. McKinney is your name, I think?&quot; she queried, with a pretty elevation of
						the eye brows.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, ma&apos;arm,&quot; said John, rather abjectly. &quot;You see, ma&apos;amBut
						I beg pardon,&quot; he went on stammeringly, and with a very awkward <pb
							id="VAA2379-065" n="70"/> bow&quot;I beg pardon, but I am
						addressingahtheahthe&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;You are addressing the new landlady,&quot; she interpolated, pleasantly.
						&quot;Mrs. Miller is my name. I think we should be friends, Mr. McKinney, since I hear
						that you are one of the oldest patrons of the house.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Thank youthank you! &quot;said John, completely embarrassed. &quot;Yes,
						indeed!ha, ha. Oh, yesyesreally, we must be quite old friends, I assure you,
						Mrs.Mrs.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Mrs. Miller,&quot; smilingly prompted the little woman.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, ah, yes,Mrs. Miller. Lovely morn-ing, Mrs. Miller,&quot; said John, edging
						past her and backing toward his room.</p>
					<p>But as Mrs. Miller was laughing outright, for some mysterious reason, and gave no
						affirmation in response to his proposition as to the quality of the weather, John,
						utterly abashed closed the door. &quot;Deucedly extraordinary woman!&quot; he thought;
						&quot;wonder what&apos;s her idea!&quot;</p>
					<p>He remained locked in his room till the dinner-hour; and, when he promptly emerged for
						that occasion, there was a very noticeable improvement in his personal appearance, in
						point of dress, at least, though there still <pb id="VAA2379-066" n="71"/> lingered
						about his smoothly-shaven features a certain haggard, care-worn, anxious look that would
						not out.</p>
					<p>Next his own place at the table he found a chair tilted forward, as though in
						reservation for some honored guest. What did it mean! Oh, he remembered now. Told the
						boy to tell his mother he would have a friend to dine with him. Bertand, blast the
						fellow! he was, doubtless, dining then with a far preferable companionhis wifein a
						palace-car on the P., C. &amp; St. L., a hundred miles away. The thought was maddening.
						Of course, now, the landlady would have material for a new assault. And how could he
						avert it? A despairing film blurred his sight for the momentthen the eyes flashed
						daringly. &quot;I will meet it like a man!&quot; he said, mentally&quot;yea, like a
						State&apos;s Attorney,I will invite it! Let her do her worst!&quot;</p>
					<p>He called a servant, directing some message in an undertone.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the agreeable servant, &quot;I &apos;ll go right away,
						sir,&quot; and left the room.</p>
					<p>Five minutes elapsed, and then a voice at his shoulder startled him:</p>
					<p>&quot;Did you send for me, Mr. McKinney? What is it I can do?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;You are very kind, Mrs.Mrs.&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-067" n="72"/>
					<p>&quot;Mrs. Miller,&quot; said the lady, with a smile that he remembered.</p>
					<p>&quot;now, please spare me even the mildest of rebukes. I deserve your censure, but I
						can &apos;t stand itI can&apos;t positively!&quot; and there was a pleading look in
						John&apos;s lifted eyes that changed the little woman&apos;s smile to an expression of
						real solicitude. &quot;I have sent tor you,&quot; continued John, &quot;to ask of you
						three great favors. Please be seated while I enumerate them. FirstI want you to forgive
						and forget that ill-natured, uncalled-for grumbling of mine this morning when you
						wakened me.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said the landlady, again smiling, though quite
						seriously.</p>
					<p>&quot;I thank you,&quot; said John, with dignity. &quot;And, second,&quot; he
						continued&quot;I want your assurance that my extreme confusion and awkwardness on the
						occasion of our meeting later were rightly interpreted.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Certainlycertainly,&quot; said the landlady, with the kindliest sympathy.</p>
					<p>&quot;I am gratefulutterly,&quot; said John, with aewer dignity. &quot;And then,&quot;
						he went on,&quot;after informing you that it is impossible for the best friend I have in
						the world to be with me at this hour, as intended, I want you to do me the very great
						honor of dining with me. Will you?&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-068" n="73"/>
					<p>&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said the charming little landlady&quot;and a thousand
						thanks beside! But tell me something of your friend,&quot; she continued, as they were
						being served. &quot;What is he likeand what is his nameand where is he?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Well,&quot;said John, warily,&quot;he&apos;s like all young fellows of his age.
						He&apos;s quite young, you knownot over thirty, I should saya mere boy, in fact, but
						clevertalentedversatile.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Unmarried, of course,&quot;said the chatty little woman.</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;said John, in a matter-of-course tonebut he caught himself
						abruptlythen stared intently at his napkinglanced evasively at the side-face of his
						questioner, and said,&quot;Oh yes! Yes, indeed! He&apos;s unmarried.Old bachelor like
						myself, you know. Ha! Ha!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;So he&apos;s not like the young man here that distinguished himself last
						night?&quot; said the little woman, archly.</p>
					<p>The fork in John&apos;s hand, half-lifted to his lips, faltered and fell back toward
						his plate.</p>
					<p>&quot;Why, what&apos;s that?&quot; said John, in a strange voice;&quot;I had n&apos;t
						heard anything about itI mean I have n&apos;t heard anything about any young man. What
						was it?&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-069" n="74"/>
					<p>&quot;Have n&apos;t heard anything about the elopement?&quot; exclaimed the little
						woman, in astonishment.&quot; Why, it&apos;s been the talk of the town all morning.
						Elopement in high lifeson of a grain-dealer, name of Hines, or Himes, or something, and
						a preacher&apos;s daughterJosie somebodydid n&apos;t catch her last name. Wonder if you
						do n&apos;t know the partiesWhy, Mr. McKinney, are you ill?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh, nonot at all!&quot; said John:&quot; Do n&apos;t mention it. Haha! Just
						eating too rapidly, that&apos;s all. Go on withyou were saying that Bert and Josie had
						really eloped.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;What &apos;Bert&apos;?&quot; asked the little woman quickly.</p>
					<p>&quot;Why, did I say Bert?&quot; said John, with a guilty look.&quot; I meant Haines,
						of course, you knowHaines and Josie.And did they really elope?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;That&apos;s the report,&quot; answered the little woman, as though deliberating
						some important evidence;&quot; and they say, too, that the plot of the runaway was quite
						ingenious. It seems the young lovers were assisted in their flight by some old
						fellowfriend of the young man&apos;sWhy, Mr. McKinney, you <hi rend="i">are</hi> ill,
						surely?&quot;</p>
					<p>John&apos;s face was ashen.</p>
					<p>&quot;Nono!&quot; he gasped, painfully: &quot;Go <pb id="VAA2379-070" n="75"/> ongo on!
						Tell me more about thethethe old fellowthe old reprobate! And is he still at
						large?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the little womon, anxiously regarding the strange demeanor of her
						companion. &quot;They say, though, that the law can do nothing with him, and that this
						fact only intensifies the agony of the broken-hearted parentsfor it seems they have,
						till now, regarded him both as a gentleman and family friend in whom&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;I really am ill,&quot; moaned John, waveringly rising to his feet; &quot;but I
						beg you not to be alarmed. Tell your little boy to come to my room, where I will retire
						at once, if you&apos;ll simply a nervous attack. I am often troubled so; and only
						perfect quiet and seclusion restores me. You have done me a great honor,
						Mrs.&quot;(&quot;Mrs.Miller,&quot; sighed the sympathetic little woman)&quot;Mrs.
						Miller,and I thank you more than I have words to express.&quot; He bowed limply, turned
						through a side door opening on a stair, and tottered to his room.</p>
					<p>During the three weeks&apos; illness through which he passed, John had every
						attentionmuch more, indeed, then he had consciousness to appreciate. For the most part
						his <pb id="VAA2379-071" n="76"/> mind wandered, and he talked of curious things, and
						laughed hysterically, and serenaded mermaids that dwelt in grassy seas of dew, and were
						bald-headed like himself. He played upon a fourteen-jointed flute of solid gold, with
						diamond holes, and keys carved out of thawless ice. His old father came at first to take
						him home; but he could not be moved, the doctor said.</p>
					<p>Two weeks of John&apos;s illness had worn away, when a very serious looking young man,
						in a traveling duster, and a high hat, came up the stairs to see him. A handsome young
						lady was clinging to his arm. It was Bert and Josie. She had guessed the very date of
						their forgiveness. John wakened even clearer in mind than usual that afternoon. He
						recognized his old chum at a glance, and Josienow Bert&apos;s wife. Yes, he comprehended
						that. He was holding a hand of each when another figure entered. His thin, white fingers
						loos-ened their clasp, and he held a hand toward the new comer. &quot;Here,&quot; he
						said, &quot;is my best friend in the worldBert, you and Josie will love her, I know; for
						this is Mrs.Mrs.&quot;&quot;Mrs. Miller,&quot; said the radiant little
						woman.&quot;Yes,Mrs. Miller,&quot;said John, very proudly.</p>

					<head>THE CHAMPION CHECKER-PLAYER OF<lb/> AMERIKY.</head>
					<p>
						<hi rend="b">O</hi>F course as fur as Checker-playin&apos;s concerned, you can&apos;t
						jest adzackly claim &apos;at lots makes fortunes and lots gits bu&apos;sted at itbut
						still, it&apos;s on&apos;y simple jestice to acknowledge &apos;at there&apos;re absolute
						p&apos;ints in the game &apos;at takes scientific principles to figger out, and a mighty
						level-headed feller to <hi rend="i">dim</hi>onstrate, don&apos;t you understand!</p>
					<p>Checkers is a&apos; <hi rend="i">old</hi> enough game, ef age is any rickommendation;
						and it&apos;s a&apos; evident fact, too, &apos;at &quot;the tooth of time,&quot; as the
						feller says, which fer the last six thousand years has gained some reputation fer
						a-eatin&apos; up things in giner&apos;l, don&apos;t &apos;pear to &apos;a&apos; gnawed
						much of a hole in Checkersjedgin&apos; from the checker-board of to-day and the ones
						&apos;at they&apos;re uccasionally shovellin&apos; out at <hi rend="i"
							>Pom</hi>p&apos;y-<hi rend="i">i,</hi> er whatever its name is. Turned up a
						checker-board there not long ago, I wuz readin&apos; &apos;bout, &apos;at still had the
						spots onas plain and fresh as the modern white-pine board o&apos; our&apos;n, squared
						off with pencil-marks and <pb id="VAA2379-094" n="102"/> pokeberry-juice. These is facts
						&apos;at history herself has dug out, and of course it ain&apos;t fer me ner you to turn
						our nose up a Checkes, whuther we ever tamper with the fool-game er not. Fur&apos;s
						that&apos;s concerned, I don&apos;t p&apos;tend to be no checker-player <hi rend="i"
							>myse&apos;f,</hi>but I know&apos;d a feller onc&apos;t &apos;at <hi rend="i"
							>could</hi> play, and sorto&apos; made a business of it; and <hi rend="i">that</hi>
						man, in my opinion, was a geenyus! Name wuz Wesley CotterlJohn Wesley Cotterljest plain
						Wes, as us fellers round the Shoe-Shop ust to call him; ust to allus make the Shoe-Shop
						his headquarters-like; and, rain er shine, wet er dry, you&apos;d allus find <hi
							rend="i">Wes</hi> on hands, ready to banter some feller fer a game, er jest
						a-settin&apos; humped up there over the checker-board all alone, a-cipher&apos;n&apos;
						out some new move er &apos;nuther, and whistling&apos; low and solem&apos; to
						hisse&apos;f-like and a-payin&apos; no attention to nobody.</p>
					<p>And <hi rend="i">I&apos;ll</hi> tell <hi rend="i">you,</hi> Wes Cotterl wuz no
						man&apos;s fool, as sly as you keep it! He wuz a deep thinker, Wes wuz; and ef he&apos;d
						&apos;a&apos; jest turned that mind o&apos; his loose on <hi rend="i"
							>preachin&apos;,</hi> fer instunce, and the &apos;terpertation o&apos; the Bible,
						don&apos;t you know, Wes &apos;ud &apos;a&apos; worked p&apos;ints out o&apos; there
						&apos;at nolivin&apos; expounderers ever got in gunshot of!</p>
					<p>But Wes he didn&apos;t &apos;pear to be cut out fer nothin&apos; much but jest
						Checker-playin&apos;. Oh, of <pb id="VAA2379-095" n="103"/> course, he <hi rend="i"
							>could</hi> knock round his own woodpile some, and garden a little, more er less; and
						the neighbers ust to find Wes purty handy &apos;bout trimmin&apos; fruit-trees, you
						understand, and workin&apos; in among the worms and cattapillers in the vines and
						shrubbery, and the like. And hand-lin&apos; bees!They wuzn&apos;t no man under the
						heavens &apos;at knowed more &apos;bout handlin&apos; bees&apos;n Wes
						Cotterl!&quot;Settlin&apos;&quot; the blame&apos; things when they wuz a-swarmin&apos;;
						and a-robbin&apos; hives, and all sich fool-resks. W&apos;y, I&apos;ve saw Wes Cotterl,
						&apos;fore now, when a swarm of bees &apos;ud settle in a&apos; orchard,like they will
						sometimes, you know,I&apos;ve saw Wes Cotterl jest roll up his shirt-sleeves and bend
						down a&apos; apple tree limb &apos;at wuz jest kivvered with the pesky things, and
						scrape &apos;em back into the hive with his naked hands, by the quart and gallon, and
						never git a scratch! You couldn&apos;t <hi rend="i">hire</hi> a bee to sting Wes
						Cotterl! But <hi rend="i">lazy?</hi>I think that man had railly ort to &apos;a&apos;
						been a&apos; Injun! He wuz the fust and on&apos;y man &apos;at ever I laid eyes on
						&apos;at wuz too lazy to drap a checker-man to p&apos;int out the right road fer a
						feller &apos;at ast him onc&apos;t the way to Burke&apos;s Mill; and Wes, &apos;ithout
						ever a-liftin&apos; eye er finger, jest sorto&apos; crooked out that mouth o&apos;
						his&apos;n in the direction the feller wanted, and says: <hi rend="i"
							>&quot;H-yonder!&quot;</hi> and went on with his whistlin&apos;. <pb id="VAA2379-096"
							n="104"/> But all this hain&apos;t Checkers, and that&apos;s what I started out to
						tell ye.</p>
					<p>Wes had a way o&apos; jest natchurly a-cleanin&apos; out anybody and ever&apos;body
						&apos;at &apos;ud he&apos;p hold up a checker-board! Wes wuzn&apos;t what you&apos;d
						call a <hi rend="i">lively</hi> player at all, ner a competiter &apos;at talked much
						&apos;crost the board er made much furse over a game whiles he <hi rend="i">wuz</hi>
						a-playin&apos;. He had his faults, o&apos; course, and <hi rend="i">would</hi> take back
						moves &apos;casion&apos;ly, er inch up on you ef you didn&apos;t watch him, mebby. But,
							<hi rend="i">as a rule,</hi> Wes had the insight to grasp the idy of whoever wuz
						a-playin&apos; ag&apos;in&apos; him, and <hi rend="i">his</hi> style o&apos; game, you
						understand, and wuz on the lookout continual&apos;; and under sich circumstances <hi
							rend="i">could</hi> play as <hi rend="i">honest</hi> a game o&apos; Checkers as the
						babe unborn.</p>
					<p>One thing in <hi rend="i">Wes&apos;s</hi> favor allus wuz the feller&apos;s
						temper.Nothin&apos; &apos;peared to aggervate Wes, and nothin&apos; on earth could break
						his slow and lazy way o&apos; takin&apos; his own time fer ever&apos;thing. You jest <hi
							rend="i">couldn&apos;t crowd Wes</hi> er git him rattled anyway.Jest &apos;peared to
						have one fixed principle, and that wuz to take plenty o&apos; time, and never make no
						move &apos;ithout a-ciphern&apos;n&apos; ahead on the prob&apos;ble consequences,
						don&apos;t you understand! &quot;Be shore you&apos;re right,&quot; Wes &apos;ud say,
						a-lettin&apos; up fer a second on that low and sorry-like <pb id="VAA2379-097" n="105"/>
						little wind-through-the-keyhole whistle o&apos; his, and a-nosin&apos; out a place whur
						he could swap one man fer two.&quot;Be shore you&apos;re right&quot;and
						somep&apos;n&apos; after this style wuz Wes&apos;s way: &quot;Be shore you&apos;re
						right&quot;(whistling a long, lonesome bar of &quot;Barbara Allen&quot;)&quot;and
						then&quot;(another long, retarded bar)&quot;go ahead!&quot;and by the time the feller
						&apos;ud git through with his whistlin&apos;, and a-stoppin&apos; and a-startin&apos; in
						ag&apos;in, he&apos;d be about three men ahead to your one. And then he&apos;d jest go
						on with his whistlin&apos; &apos;sef nothin&apos; had happened, and mebby you a-jest
						a-rearin&apos; and a-callin&apos; him all the mean outlandish, ornry names &apos;at you
						could lay tongue to.</p>
					<p>But Wes&apos;s good nature, I reckon, was the thing &apos;at he&apos;ped him out as
						much as any other p&apos;ints the feller had. And <hi rend="i">Wes &apos;ud attus win,
							in the long run!</hi>I don&apos;t keer <hi rend="i">who</hi> played ag&apos;inst him!
						It was on&apos;y a question o&apos; time with Wes o&apos; waxin&apos; it to the best of
						&apos;em. Lots o&apos; players has <hi rend="i">tackled</hi> Wes, and right at the <hi
							rend="i">start</hi> &apos;ud mebby give him trouble,but in the <hi rend="i">long
							run</hi>, now mind ye<hi rend="i">in the long run</hi>, no mortal man, I reckon, had
						any business o&apos; rubbin&apos; knees with Wes Cotterl under no airthly checker-board
						in all this vale o&apos; tears!</p>
					<p>I mind onc&apos;t th&apos; come along a high-toned <pb id="VAA2379-098" n="106"/>
						feller from in around In&apos;i&apos;nop &apos;lus somers.Wuz a <hi rend="i"
							>lawyer,</hi> er some <hi rend="i">p&apos;fessional</hi> kind o&apos; man. Had a big
						yaller, luther-kivvered book under his arm, and a bunch o&apos; these-&apos;ere big
							en<hi rend="i">vel</hi>op&apos;s and a lot o&apos; suppeenies stickin&apos; out
						o&apos; his breast-pocket. Mighty slick-lookin&apos; feller he wuz; wore a stove-pipe
						hat, sorto&apos; set &apos;way back on his headso&apos;s to show off his Giner&apos;l
						Jackson forr&apos;ed, don&apos;t you know! Well-sir, this feller struck the place, on
						some business er other, and then missed the hack &apos;at <hi rend="i">ort</hi> to
						&apos;a&apos; tuk him out o&apos; here sooner&apos;n it <hi rend="i">did</hi> take him
						out!And whiles he wuz a-loafin&apos; round, sorto&apos; lonesomelike a feller allus <hi
							rend="i">is</hi> in a strange place, you knowhe kindo&apos; drapped in on our crowd at
						the Shoe-Shop, ostenchably to git a boot-strop stitched on, but <hi rend="i">I</hi>
						knowed, the minute he set foot in the door, &apos;at <hi rend="i">that</hi> feller
						wanted <hi rend="i">comp&apos;ny</hi> wuss&apos;n <hi rend="i">cobbling&apos;.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>Well, as good luck would have it, there set Wes, as usual, with the checker-board in
						his lap, a-playin&apos; all by hisse&apos;f, and a-whistlin&apos; so low and
						solem&apos;-like and sad it railly made the crowd seem like a <hi rend="i"
							>religious</hi> getherun&apos; o&apos; some kind er other, we wuz all so quiet and
						still-like, as the man come in.</p>
					<p>Well, the stranger stated his business, set down, tuk off his boot, and set there
						nussin&apos; his <pb id="VAA2379-099" n="107"/> foot and talkin&apos; weather fer ten
						minutes, I reckon, &apos;fore he ever &apos;peared to notice Wes at all. We wuz all
						back&apos;ard, anyhow, &apos;bout talkin&apos; much; besides, we knowed, long afore he
						come in, all about how hot the weather wuz, and the pore chance there wuz o&apos; rain,
						and all that; and so the subject had purty well died out, when jest then the
						feller&apos;s eyes struck Wes and the checker-board,and I&apos;ll never fergit the warm,
						salvation smile &apos;at flashed over him &apos;at the promisin&apos; discovery. <hi
							rend="i">&quot;What!&quot;</hi> says he, a-grinnin&apos; like a&apos; angel and
						a-edgin&apos; his cheer to&apos;rds Wes, &quot;have we a checker-board and checkers
						here?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;We hev,&quot; says I, knowin&apos; &apos;at Wes wouldn&apos;t let go o&apos; that
						whistle long enough to answermore&apos;n to mebby nod his head.</p>
					<p>&quot;And who is your best player?&quot; says the feller, kindo&apos; pitiful-like,
						with another inquirin&apos; look atWes.</p>
					<p>&quot;Him,&quot; says I, a-pokin&apos; Wes with a peg-float. But Wes on&apos;y spit
						kindo&apos; absent-like, and went on with his whistlin&apos;.</p>
					<p>&quot;Much of a player, is he?&quot; says the feller, with a sorto&apos; doubtful smile
						at Wes ag&apos;in.</p>
					<p>&quot;Plays a purty good hick&apos;ry,&quot; says I, a-pokin&apos; Wes ag&apos;in.
						&quot;Wes,&quot; says I, &quot;here&apos;s a gentleman &apos;at &apos;ud mebby like to
						take a hand <pb id="VAA2379-100" n="108"/> with you there, and give you a few
						idys,&quot; says I.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; says the stranger, eager-like, a-settin&apos; his plug-hat
						keerful&apos; up in the empty shelvin&apos;, and a-rubbin&apos; his hands and
						smilin&apos; as confident-like as old Hoyle hisse&apos;f,&quot;Yes, indeed, I&apos;d be
						glad to give the gentleman&quot; (meanin&apos; Wes) &quot;a&apos; idy er two about
						Checkersef <hi rend="i">he&apos;d</hi> jest as lief,&apos;cause I reckon ef
						there&apos;re any one thing &apos;at I <hi rend="i">do</hi> know more about &apos;an
						another, it&apos;s Checkers,&quot; says he; &quot;and there&apos;re no game &apos;at
						delights me more<hi rend="i">pervidin&apos;,</hi> o&apos; course, I find a competiter
						&apos;at kin make it anyways inte<hi rend="i">rest</hi>in&apos;.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Got much of a rickord on Checkers?&quot; says I.</p>
					<p>&quot;Well,&quot; says the feller, &quot;I don&apos;t like to brag, but I&apos;ve never
							<hi rend="i">ben</hi> beatin any <hi rend="i">legitimut</hi> contest,&quot; says he,
						&quot;and I&apos;ve played more&apos;n one o&apos; <hi rend="i">them,&quot;</hi> he
						says, &quot;here and there round the country. Of course, <hi rend="i">your friend</hi>
						here,&quot; he went on, smilin&apos; sociable at Wes, <hi rend="i">&quot;he&apos;ll</hi>
						take it all in good part ef I should happen to lead him a littlejest as <hi rend="i"
							>I&apos;d</hi> do,&quot; he says, &quot;ef it wuz possible fer him to lead <hi
							rend="i">me.&quot;</hi>
					</p>
					<p>
						<hi rend="i">&quot;Wes,&quot;</hi> says I, <hi rend="i">&quot;has</hi> warmed the wax in
						the yeers of some mighty good checker-players,&quot; says I, as he squared the board
						around, still a-whistlin&apos; <pb id="VAA2379-101" n="109"/> to hisse&apos;f-like, as
						the stranger tuk his place, a-smilin&apos;-like and roachin&apos; back his hair.</p>
					<p>&quot;Move,&quot; says Wes.</p>
					<p>&quot;No,&quot; says the feller, with a polite flourish of his hand; &quot;the first
						move shall be your&apos;n.&quot; And, by jacks! fer all he wouldn&apos;t take even the
						advantage of a starter, he flaxed it to Wes the fust game in less&apos;n fifteen
						minutes.</p>
					<p>&quot;Right shore you&apos;ve give&apos; me your best player?&quot; he says,
						smilin&apos; round at the crowd, as Wes set squarin&apos; the board fer another game and
						whistlin&apos; as onconcerned-like as ef nothin&apos; had happened more&apos;n
						ordinary.</p>
					<p>&quot;&apos;S your move,&quot; says Wes, a-squintin&apos; out into the game &apos;bout
						forty foot from shore, and a-whistlin&apos; purt&apos; nigh in a whisper.</p>
					<p>Well-sir, it &apos;peared-like the feller railly didn&apos;t <hi rend="i">try</hi> to
						play; and you could see, too, &apos;at Wes knowed he&apos;d about met his match, and
						played accordin&apos;. He didn&apos;t make no move at all &apos;at he didn&apos;t give
						keerful thought to; whilse the feller! well, as I wuz sayin&apos;, it jest
						&apos;peared-like <hi rend="i">Checkers</hi> wuz <hi rend="i">child&apos;s-play</hi> fer
						him! Putt in most o&apos; the time &apos;long througth the game a-sayin&apos; things
						calkilated to kindo&apos; bore a&apos; ordinary man. But Wes helt hisse&apos;f purty
						level, and didn&apos;t show no signs, and kep&apos; up his <hi rend="i"
							>whistlin&apos;</hi>, mighty wellconsiderin&apos;.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-102" n="110"/>
					<p>&quot;Reckon you play the <hi rend="i">fiddle</hi>, too, as well as <hi rend="i"
							>Checkers?</hi>&quot; says the feller, laughin&apos;, as Wes come a-whistlin&apos; out
						of the little end of the second game and went on a-fixin&apos; fer the next round.</p>
					<p>&quot;&apos;S my move!&quot; says Wes &apos;thout seemin&apos; to notice the
						feller&apos;s tantalizin&apos; words whatsomever.</p>
					<p>&quot;&apos;&quot;L! <hi rend="i">this</hi> time,&quot; thinks I, &quot;Mr. Smarty from
						the <hi rend="i">me</hi>trolopin deestricts, <hi rend="i">you&apos;re</hi> liable to git
							<hi rend="i">waxedshore!&quot;</hi> But the <hi rend="i">feller</hi> didn&apos;t
						&apos;pear to think so at all, and played right ahead as glib-like and keerless as
						ever&apos;casion&apos;ly a-throwin&apos; in them sarcastic remarks o&apos;
						his&apos;n,&apos;bout bein&apos; &quot;slow and shore&quot; &apos;bout things in
						gineral&quot;Liked to <hi rend="i">see</hi> that,&quot; he said:&quot;Liked to see
						fellers do things with plenty o&apos; <hi rend="i">deliberation</hi>, and even ef a
						feller <hi rend="i">wuzn&apos;t</hi> much of a checker-player, liked to see him <hi
							rend="i">die</hi> slow <hi rend="i">anyhow!</hi>and then &apos;tend his own
						funeral,&quot; he says,and march in the p&apos;sessionto his own <hi rend="i"
						>music</hi>,&quot; says he.And jest then his remarks wuz brung to a close by Wes
						a-jumpin&apos; two men, and a-lightin square in the king-row. . ..</p>
					<p>&quot;Crown that,&quot; says Wes, a-droppin&apos; back into his old tune. And fer the
						rest o&apos; <hi rend="i">that</hi> game Wes helt the feller purty level, but had to
						finally knock underbut by jest the clos&apos;test kind o&apos; shave o&apos;
						winnin&apos;.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-103" n="111"/>
					<p>&quot;They ain&apos;t much use,&quot; says the feller, &quot;o&apos; keepin&apos; <hi
							rend="i">this</hi> thing up&apos;less I could manage, <hi rend="i">some</hi> way er
						other, to git beat <hi rend="i">onc&apos;t&apos;n a while!</hi>&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Move,&quot; says Wes, a-drappin&apos; back into the same old whistle and a-<hi
							rend="i">settlin&apos;</hi> there.</p>
					<p>&quot;&apos;Music has charms,&apos; as the Good Book tells us,&quot; says the feller,
						kindo&apos; nervous-like, and a-roachin&apos; his hair back as ef some sort o&apos;
						p&apos;tracted headache wuz a-settin&apos; in.</p>
					<p>&quot;Never wuz <hi rend="i">&apos;skunked,&apos;</hi> wuz ye?&quot; says Wes,
						kindo&apos; suddent-like, with a fur-off look in them big white eyes o&apos; hisand then
						a-whistlin&apos; right on, &apos;set he hadn&apos;t said <hi rend="i"
						>nothin.</hi>&apos;</p>
					<p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Not much!</hi>&quot; says the feller, sorto&apos;
						s&apos;prised-like, as ef such a&apos; idy as that had never struck him
						afore.&quot;Never was &apos;skunked&apos; <hi rend="i">myse&apos;f:</hi> but I&apos;ve
						saw fellers in my time &apos;at <hi rend="i">wuz!</hi>&quot; says he.</p>
					<p>But from that time on I noticed the feller &apos;peared to play more keerful, and
						railly la&apos;nched into the game with somepin&apos; like inter&apos;st. Wes he seemed
						to be jest a-limberin&apos;-up-like; and-sir, blame me! ef he didn&apos;t walk the
						feller&apos;s log fer him <hi rend="i">that</hi> time, &apos;thout no &apos;pearent
						trouble at all!</p>
					<p>&quot;And, <hi rend="i">now</hi>,&quot; says Wes, all quiet-like, a-squar-in&apos; the
						board fer another&apos;n,&quot;we&apos;re kindo&apos; gittin&apos; at things <hi
							rend="i">right</hi>. Move.&quot; And away went that little unconcerned whistle o&apos;
						his ag&apos;in, and <pb id="VAA2379-104" n="112"/>
						<hi rend="i">Mr. Cityman</hi> jest gittin&apos; white and sweaty toohe wuz so nervous.
						Ner he didn&apos;t &apos;pear to find much to laugh at in the next gamener the next two
						games nuther! Things wuz a-gettin&apos; mighty interestin&apos; &apos;bout them times,
						and I guess the feller wuz ser&apos;ous-like a-wakin&apos; up to the solem&apos; fact
						&apos;at it tuk &apos;bout all his spare time to keep up his end o&apos; the row, and
						even that state o&apos; &apos;pore satisfaction wuz a-creepin&apos; furder and furder
						away from him ever&apos; new turn he undertook. Whilse Wes jest &apos;peared to git more
						deliber&apos;t&apos; and certain ever&apos; game;and that unendin&apos;
						se&apos;f-satisfied and comfortin&apos; little whistle o&apos; his never drapped a
						stitch, but toed out ever&apos; game alike,to&apos;rds the <hi rend="i">last</hi>, and,
						fer the <hi rend="i">most</hi> part, disasterss to the feller &apos;at had started in
						with sich <hi rend="i">confidence</hi> and actchul promise, don&apos;t you know</p>
					<p>Well-sir, the feller stuck the whole <hi rend="i">forenoon</hi> out, and then the <hi
							rend="i">afternoon</hi>; and then knuckled down to it &apos;way into the nightyes, and
						plum <hi rend="i">midnight!</hi>And he buckled into the thing bright and airly <hi
							rend="i">next morning!</hi> And-sir, fer <hi rend="i">two long days</hi> and nights,
						a-hardly a-stoppin&apos; long enough to eat, the feller stuck it out,and Wes a-jest
						a-warpin&apos; it to him hand-over-fist, and leavin&apos; him furder behind, ever&apos;
						game!till finally, to&apos;rds the last, the feller got so blame-don worked up and
						excited-like, he jes &apos;peared <pb id="VAA2379-105" n="113"/> actchully purt&apos;
						nigh plum crazy and histurical as a woman!</p>
					<p>It wuz a-gittin&apos; late into the shank of the second day, and the boys hed jest lit
						a candle fer &apos;em to finish out one of the clost&apos;est games the feller&apos;d
						played Wes fer some time. But Wes wuz jest as cool and ca&apos;m as ever, and still
						a-whistlin&apos; consolin&apos; to hisse&apos;f-like, whilse the feller jest
						&apos;peared wore out and ready to drap right in his tracks any minute.</p>
					<p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Dune you!</hi>&quot; he snarled out at Wes, &quot;hain&apos;t you
						never goern to move?&quot; And there set Wes, a-balancin&apos; a checker-man above the
						board, a-studyin&apos; whur to set it, and a-fillin&apos; in the time with that-air
						whistle.</p>
					<p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Flames and flashes!</hi>&quot; says the feller ag&apos;in,
						&quot;will you <hi rend="i">ever</hi> stop that death-seducin&apos; tune o&apos;
						your&apos;n long enough to move?&quot;And as Wes deliber&apos;t&apos;ly set his man down
						whur the feller see he&apos;d haf to jump it and lose two men and a king, Wes wuz
						a-singin&apos;, low and sad-like, as of all to hisse&apos;f:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;<hi rend="i">O we&apos;ll move that man, and leave him there</hi>.</l>
						<l n="2">
							<hi rend="i">Fer the love of B-a-r-bbry Al-len!</hi>&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>Well-sir! the feller jest jumped to his feet, upset the board, and tore out u&apos; the

							n="114"/> some of us putt out after him and overtook him &apos;way beyent the

						<head>AN OLD SWEETHEART</head>
						<lg>
							<l n="1">
								<hi rend="b">A</hi>S ONE who cons at evening o&apos;er an album all alone,</l>
							<l n="2">And muses on the faces of the friends that he has Known,</l>
							<l n="3">So I turn leaves of fancy till, in shadowy design,</l>
							<l n="4">I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="5">The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,</l>
							<l n="6">As I turn it low to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,</l>
							<l n="7">And light my pipe in silence, save a sight that seems to yoke</l>
							<l n="8">Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="9">&quot;Tis a fragrant retrospectionfor the loving thoughts that start</l>
							<l n="10">Into being are like perfumes from the blossom of the heart;</l>
							<l n="11">And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine</l>
							<l n="12">When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart Of mine.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="13">Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,</l>
							<l n="14">The voices of my children, and the mother as she sings,</l>
							<l n="15">I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme</l>
							<l n="16">When care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="17">In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm</l>
							<l n="18">To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm</l>
							<l n="19">For I find an extra flavor in Memory&apos;s mellow wine</l>
							<l n="20">That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="21">A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace,</l>
							<l n="22">Floats out of my tobacco as the genii from the vase</l>
							<pb id="VAA2379-109" n="118"/>
							<l n="23">And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes</l>
							<l n="24">As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="25">I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress</l>
							<l n="26">She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress</l>
							<l n="27">With the written declaration that, &quot;as surely as the vine</l>
							<l n="28">Grew &apos;round the stump,&quot; she loved methat old sweet-heart of
								mine.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="29">And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,</l>
							<l n="30">As we used to talk together of the future we had planned</l>
							<l n="31">When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do</l>
							<l n="32">But write the tender verses that she set the music to:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="33">When we should live together in a cozy little cot</l>
							<l n="34">Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,</l>
							<l n="35">Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,</l>
							<l n="36">And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="37">When I should be her lover forever and a day,</l>
							<l n="38">And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;</l>
							<l n="39">And we should be so happy that when either&apos;s lips were dumb</l>
							<l n="40">They would not smile in Heaven till the other&apos;s kiss had come.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l n="41">But, ah! My dream is broken by a step upon the stair,</l>
							<l n="42">And the door is softly opened, andmy wife is standing there;</l>
							<l n="43">Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign</l>
							<l n="44">To greet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine.</l>

							<l n="3">Of us ate any breakfastonly one,</l>
							<l n="4">And that was Papaand his eyes were red</l>
							<l n="5">When he come round where we were, by the shed</l>
							<l n="6">Where Jack was lying, half way in the sun</l>
							<l n="7">And halfway in the shade. When we begun</l>
							<l n="8">To cry out loud, Pa turned and dropped his head</l>
							<l n="9">And went away; and Mamma, she went back</l>
							<l n="10">Into the kitchen. Then, for a long while,</l>
							<l n="11">All to ourselves, like, we stood there and cried.</l>
							<l n="12">We thought so many good things of Old Jack,</l>
							<l n="13">And funny thingsalthough we did n&apos;t smile</l>
							<l n="14">We could n&apos;t only cry when Old Jack died.</l>

							<l n="15">When Old Jack died, it seemed a human friend</l>
							<l n="16">Had suddenly gone from us; that some face</l>
							<l n="17">That we had loved to fondle and embrace</l>
							<l n="18">From babyhood, no more would condescend</l>
							<l n="19">To smile on us forever. We might bend</l>
							<l n="20">With tearful eyes above him, interlace</l>
							<l n="21">Our chubby fingers o&apos;er him, romp and race,</l>
							<l n="22">Plead with him, call and coaxaye, we might send</l>
							<l n="23">The old halloo up for him, whistle, hist,</l>
							<l n="24">(If sobs had let us) or, as wildly vain,</l>
							<l n="25">Snapped thumbs, called &quot;speak,&quot; and he had not replied;</l>

					<head>A WILD IRISHMAN.</head>
					<p>
						<hi rend="b">N</hi>OT very many years ago the writer was for some months stationed at
						South Bend, a thriving little city of northern Indians, its main population on the one
						side of the St. Joseph river, but quite a respectable fraction thereof taking its
						industrial way to the opposite shore, and there gaining an audience and a hearing in the
						rather imposing growth and hurly-burly of its big manufactories, and the consequent
						rapid appearance of multitudinous neat cottages, tenement houses and business blocks. A
						strsanger, entering South Bend proper on any ordinary day, will be at some loss to
						account for its prosperous appearanceits flagged and bowldered streetsits handsome
						mercantile blocks, banks, and business houses generally. Reasoning from cause to effect,
						and seeing but a meager sprinkling of people on the streets throughout the day, and
						these seeming, for the most part, merely idlers, and in no wise accessory to the evident
						thrift and opulence of their surroundings, the observant srranger will be puzzled at the
						situation. But when evening comes, and the outlying foundries, sewing-machine, <pb
							id="VAA2379-129" n="140"/> wagon, plow, and other &quot;works,&quot; together with the
						paper-mills and all the nameless industrieswhen the operations of all these are
						suspended for the day, and the workmen and workwomen loosed from laborthen, as this vast
						army suddenly invades and overflows bridge, roadway, street and lane, the startled
						stranger will fully comprehend the why and wherefore of the city&apos;s high prosperity.
						And, once acquainted with the people there, the fortunate sojourner will find no
						ordinary culture and intelligence, and, as certainly, he will meet with a social spirit
						and a wholesouled heartiness that will make the place a lasting memory. The town, too,
						is tge home of many world-known notables, and a host of local celebrities, the chief of
						which latter class I found, during my stay there, in the person of Tommy Stafford, or
						&quot;The Wild Irishman&quot; as everybody called him.</p>
					<p>&quot;Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters,&quot; said Major Blowney, my
						employer, one afternoon, &quot;you must see our &apos;Wild Irishman &apos; here before
						you say you &apos;ve yet found the queerest, brightest, cleverest chap in all your
						travels. What d&apos;ye say, Stockford?&quot; And the Major paused in his work of
						charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun and turned to await his
						partner&apos;s response.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-130" n="141"/>
					<p>Stockford, thus addressed, paused above the shield-sign he was lettering, slowly
						smiling as be dipped and trailed his pencil through the ivory black upon a bit of broken
						glass and said, in his deliberate, half-absent-minded way,&quot;Is it Tommy you&apos;re
						telling him about?&quot; and then, with a gradual broadening of the smile, he went on,
						&quot;Well, I should say so. Tommy! What&apos;s come of the fellow, anyway? I
						haven&apos;t seen him since his last bout with the mayor, on his trial for shakin&apos;
						up that fast-horse man.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;The fast-horse man got just exactly what he needed, too,&quot; said the genial
						Major, laughing, and mopping his perspiring brow. &quot;The fellow was barkin&apos; up
						the wrong stump when he tackled Tommy! Got beat in the trade, athis own game, you know,
						ans wound up by an insult that on Irishman would take; and Tommu just naturally wore out
						the hall carpet of the old hotel with him!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;And then collared and led him to the mayor&apos;s office himself, they
						say!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh, he did!&quot; said the Major, with a dash of pride in the confirmation;
						&quot;that&apos;s Tommy all over I&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Funny trial, was n&apos;t it?&quot; continued the ruminating Stockford.</p>
					<p>&quot;Was n&apos;t it though?&quot; laughed the Major. <pb id="VAA2379-131" n="142"/>
						&quot;The porter&apos;s testimony: You see, he was for Tommy, of course, and on
						wxamination testified that the horse-man struck Tommy first. And there Tommy broke in
						with:&quot; He&apos;s a-meanin&apos; well, yer Honor, but he&apos;s lyin&apos; to
						yehe&apos;s lyin&apos; to ye. No livin&apos; man iver struck me firstnor last, nayther,
						for the matter o&apos; that!&apos; And I thoughtthecourtwoulddie!&quot; concluded the
						Major, in a like imminent state of merriment.</p>
					<p>&quot;Yes, and he said if he struck him first,&quot; supplemented Stockford, &quot;he
						&apos;d like to know why the horseman was &apos; wearin&apos; all the black eyes, and
						the blood, and the boomps on the head of um!&apos; And it&apos;s that talk of his that
						got him off with so light a fine!&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;As it always does,&quot; said the Major, coming to himself abruptly and looking
						at his watch. &quot;Stock&apos;, you say you &apos;re not going along with our
						duck-shooting party this time? The old Kankakee is just lousy with &apos;em this season!
						&apos;</p>
					<p>&quot;Can&apos;t go possibly,&quot; said Stockford, &quot;not on account of the work at
						all, but the folks at home ain&apos;t just as well as I &apos;d like to see them, and I
						&apos;ll stay here till they &apos;re better. Next time I &apos;ll try and be ready for
						you. Going to take Tommy, of course?&apos;</p>
					<p>&quot;Of course! Got to have &apos; &apos; The Wild Irishman&apos; <pb id="VAA2379-132"
							n="143"/> with us! I &apos; m going around to find him now.&quot; Then turning to me
						the Major con tinued, &quot;Suppose you get on your coat and hat and come along?
						It&apos;s the best chance you &apos;ll ever have to meet Tommy. It&apos;s late anyhow,
						and Stockford &apos;11 get along without you. Come on.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Stockford; &quot;go ahead. And you can take him ducking,
						too, if he wants to go.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;But he does n&apos;t want to goand won&apos;t go,&quot; replied the Major with a
						commiserative glance at me.&quot; Says he does n&apos;t know a duck from a poll
						parrotnor how to load a shotgunand could n&apos;t hit a house if he were inside of it
						and the door shut. Admits that he nearly killed his uncle once, on the other side of a
						tree, with a squirrel runnin&apos; down it. Do n&apos;t want him along! &apos;</p>
					<p>Reaching the street with the genial Major, he gave me this advice: &quot;Now, when you
						meet Tommy, you must n&apos;t take all he says for dead earnest, and you must n&apos;t
						believe, be cause he talks loud, and in italics every other word, that he wants to do
						all the talking and won&apos;t be interfered with. That&apos;s the way he&apos;s apt to
						strike folks at firstbut it&apos;s their mis take, not his. Talk back to himcontrovert
						him whenever he&apos;s aggressive in the utterance <pb id="VAA2379-133" n="144"/> of his
						opinions, and if you&apos;re only honest in the announcement of your own ideas and
						beliefs, he &apos;ll like you all the better for standing by them. He&apos;s
						quick-tempered, and perhaps a trifle sensitive, so share your greater patience with him,
						and he &apos; ll pay you back by fighting for you at the drop of the hat. In short,
						he&apos;s as nearly typical of his gallant country&apos;s brave, impetuous, fun-loving
						individuality as such a likeness can exist.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;But is he quarrelsome?&quot; I asked.</p>
					<p>&quot;Not at all. There&apos;s the trouble. If he&apos;d only quarrel there &apos;d be
						no harm done. Quarreling&apos;s cheap, and Tommy&apos;s extravagant. A big blacksmith
						here, the other day, kicked some boy out of his shop, and Tommy, on his cart, happened
						to be passing at the time; and he just jumped off without a word, and went in and worked
						on that fellow for about three minutes, with such disastrous results that they could
						n&apos;t tell his shop from a slaughter-house; paid an assault and battery fine, and
						gave the boy a dollar beside, and the whole thing was a positive luxury to him. But I
						guess we &apos;d better drop the subject, for here&apos;s his cart, and here&apos;s
						Tommy. Hi! there, you &apos; Fardown&apos; Irish Mick!&quot; called the Major, in
						affected antipathy, &quot;been out raiding the honest farmers&apos; hen-roosts again,
						have you?&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-134" n="145"/>
					<p>We had halted at a corner grocery and produce store, as I took it, and the
						smooth-faced, shave-headed man in woolen shirt, short vest, and suspenderless trousers
						so boisterously addressed by the Major, was just lifting from the back of his cart a
						coop of cackling chickens.</p>
					<p>&quot;Arrah! ye blasted Kerryonian I&quot; replied the handsome fellow, depositing the
						coop on the curb and straightening his tall, slender figure; &quot;I were jist thinking
						of yez and the ducks, and here ye come quackin&apos; into the prisence of r&apos;yalty,
						wid yer canvas-back suit upon ye and the shwim-skins bechuxt yer toes! How air yez,
						anyhowand air we startin&apos; for the Kankakee by the nixt post?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;We &apos;re to start just as soon as we get the boys together,&quot; said the
						Major, shaking hands. &quot;The crowd&apos;s to be at Andrews&apos; by 4, and it&apos;s
						fully that now; so come on at once. We &apos;ll go &apos;round by Munson&apos;s and have
						Hi send a boy to look after your horse. Come; and I want to introduce my friend here to
						you, and we &apos;ll all want to smoke and jabber a little in appropriate seclusion.
						Come on.&quot; And the impatient Major had linked arms with his hesitating ally and
						myself, and was turning the corner of the street.</p>
					<p>&quot;It&apos;s an hour&apos;s work I have yet wid the squawkers,&quot; mildly
						protested Tommy, still <pb id="VAA2379-135" n="146"/> hanging back and stepping a trifle
						high; &quot;but, as one Irishman would say til another, &apos;Ye &apos; re wrong, but
						I&apos;m wid ye!&apos;&quot;</p>
					<p>And five minutes later the three of us had joined a very jolly party in a snug back
						room, with <q direct="unspecified">
							<lg>
								<l n="1">&quot;The chamber walls depicted all around</l>
								<l n="2">With portraitures of huntsman, hawk, and hound,</l>
								<l n="3">And the hurt deer;&quot;</l>
							</lg>
						</q> and where, as well, drifted over the olfactory intelligence a certain subtle,
						warm-breathed aroma, that genially combatted the chill and darkness of the day without,
						and, resurrecting long-dead Christmases, brimmed the grateful memory with all
						comfortable cheer.</p>
					<p>A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of Tommy and the Major, the latter
						adroitly pushing the jovial Irishman to the front, with a mock-heroic introduction to
						the general company, at the conclusion of which Tommy, with his hat tucked under the
						left elbow, stood bowing with a grace of pose and presence Lord Chesterfield might have
						applauded.</p>
					<p>&quot;Gintleman,&quot; said Tommy, settled back upon his heels and admiringly
						contemplating the group; &quot;Gintlemen, I congratu-late yez wid a pride that shoves

							id="VAA2379-137" n="148"/> son o&apos; yez, and success to the &apos; Duck-hunters of
						Kankakee.&apos;&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;The duck-hunters of the Kankakee! &quot;chorussed the elated party in such
						musical uproar that for a full minute the voice of the enthusiastic Majorwho was trying
						to say somethingcould not be heard. Then he said:</p>
					<p>&quot;I want to propose that theme&apos; The Duck-hunters of the Kankakee&apos;, for
						one of Tommy&apos;s improvisations. &apos;I moe we have a song now from Tommy on the
						&apos;Duck-hunters of the Kankakee.&apos;&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Hurra! Hurra! A song from Tommy,&quot; cried the crowd. &quot;Make us up a song,
						and put us all into it I A song from Tommy! A song! A song!&quot;</p>
					<p>There was a queer light in the eye of the Irishman. I observed him narrowlyexpectantly.
						Often I had read of this phenomenal art of improvised ballad-singing, but had always
						remained a little skeptical in regard to the possibility of such a feat. Even in the
						notable instances of this gift as displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook, I had
						always half suspected some prior preparationsome adroit forecasting of the sequence that
						seemed the instant inspiration of his witty versus. <pb id="VAA2379-138" n="149"/> Here
						was evidently to be a test example, and I was all alert to mark its minutest detail.</p>
					<p>The clamor had subsided, and Tommy had drawn a chair near to and directly fronting the
						Major&apos;s. His right hand was extended, closely grasping the right hand of his friend
						which he scarce perceptibly, though measur-edly, lifted and let fall throughout the
						length of all the curious performance. The voice was not unmusical, nor was the quaint
						old ballad-air adopted by the singer unlovely in the least; simply a monotony was
						evident that accorded with the levity and chance-finish of the improvisationand that the
						song was improved on the instant I am certainthough in no wise remarkable, for other
						reasons, in rhythmic worth or finish. And while his smiling auditors all drew nearer,
						and leant, with parted lips to catch every syllable, the words of the strange melody
						trailed unhesitatingly into the lines literally as here subjoined:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;One gloomy day in the airly Fall,</l>
						<l n="2">Whin the subshine had no chance at all</l>
						<l n="3">No chance at all for to gleam and shine</l>
						<l n="4">And lighten up this heart of mine:</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="5">&quot;&apos;Twas in South Bend, that famous town,</l>
						<l n="6">Whilst I were a strollin&apos; round and round,</l>
						<l n="7">I met some friends and they say to me:</l>
						<l n="8">&apos;It&apos;s a hunt we&apos;ll take on the Kankakee!&apos;&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA2379-139" n="150"/>
					<p>&quot;Hurra for the Kankakee! Give it to us, Tommy!&apos; cried an enthused voice
						between verses. &quot;Now give it to the Major! &quot;And the song went on:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;There&apos;s Major Blowney leads the van,</l>
						<l n="2">As crack a shot as an Irishman,</l>
						<l n="3">For it&apos;s the duck is a tin decoy</l>
						<l n="4">That his owld shotgun can&apos;t destroy;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>And a half a dozen jubilant palms patted the Major&apos;s shoulders, and his ruddy,
						good-natured face beamed with delight. &quot;Now give it to the rest of &apos;em,
						Tommy!&quot;chuckled the Major. And the song continued:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;And along wid &apos;Hank&apos; is Mick Maharr,</l>
						<l n="2">And Barney Pince, at &apos;The Shamrock&apos; bar</l>
						<l n="3">There&apos;s Barney Pinch, wid his heart so true;</l>
						<l n="4">And the Andrews Brothers they&apos;ll go too.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>Hold on, Tommy!&quot; chipped in oned of the Andrews; &quot;you must give &apos;the
						Andrews Brothers &apos; a better advertisement than that! Turn us on a full verse,
						can&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Make &apos;em pay for it if you do!&quot;said the Major, in an undertone. And
						Tommy promptly amended:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;O, the Andrews Brothers, they&apos;ll be there</l>
						<l n="2">Wid good se-gyars and wine to shpare,</l>
						<l n="3">They&apos;ll that us here on fine champagne,</l>
						<l n="4">And whin we&apos;re there they&apos;ll treat us again.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA2379-140" n="151"/>
					<p>The applause here was vociferous, and only discountinued when a box of Havanas stood
						open on the table. During the momentary lull thus occasioned, I caught the Major&apos;s
						twinkling eyes glancing evasively toward me, as he leant whispering some further
						instructions to Tommy, who again took up his desultory ballad, while I turned and fled
						for the street, catching, however, as I went, and high above the laughter of the crowd,
						the satire of this quatrain to its latest line</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">&quot;But R-R Riley he&apos;ll not go, I guess,</l>
						<l n="2">Lest he&apos;d get lost in the wil der-ness,</l>
						<l n="3">And so in the city he will shtop</l>
						<l n="4">For to curl his hair in the barber shop.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>It was after six when I reached the hotel, but I had my hair trimmed before I went in
						to supper. The style of trimming adopted then I still rigidly adhere to, and call it
						&quot;the Tommy Stafford stubble-crop.&quot;</p>
					<p>Ten days passed before I again saw the Major. Immediately upon his returnit was late
						afternoon when I heard of itI determined to take my evening walk out the long street
						toward his pleasant home and call upon him there. This I did, and found him in a
						wholesome state of fatigue, slippers and easy chair, enjoying his pipe on the piazza. Of
							<pb id="VAA2379-141" n="152"/> course, he was overflowing with happy reminiscences of
						the huntthe wood-and-water-craftboatsambushesdecoys, and tramp, and camp, and so on,
						without end;but I wanted to hear him talk of &quot;The Wild Irishman &quot;Tommy; and I
						think, too, now, that the sagacious Major secretly read my desires all the time. To be
						utterly frank with the reader I will admit that I not only think the Major divined my
						interest in Tommy, but I know he did; for at last, as though reading my very thoughts,
						he abruptly said, after a long pause, in which he knocked the ashes from his pipe and
						refilled and lighted it:&quot;Well, all I know of &apos; The Wild Irishman &apos; I can
						tell you in a very few wordsthat is, if you care at all to listen?&quot;And the crafty
						old Major seemed to hesitate.</p>
					<p>&quot;Go ongo on!&quot; I said, eagerly.</p>
					<p>&quot;About forty years ago,&quot; resumed the Major, placidly, &quot;in the little,
						old, unheard-of town Karnteel, County Tyrone, Province Ulster, Ireland, Tommy Staffordin
						spite of the contrary opinion of his wretchedly poor parentswas fortunate enough to be
						born. And here, again, as I advised you the other day, you must be prepared for constant
						surprises in the study of Tommy&apos;s character.&quot;</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-142" n="153"/>
					<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; I said; &quot;I &apos;m prepared for thing.&quot;</p>
					<p>The Major smiled profoundly and continued:</p>
					<p>&quot;Fifteen years ago, when he came to Americaand the Lord only knows how he got the
						passage-moneyhe brought his widowed mother with him here, and has supported, and is
						still supporting her. Besides,&quot; went on the still secretly smiling Major, &quot;the
						fellow has actually found time, through all his adversities, to pick up quite a
						smattering of education, here and there&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Poor fellow!&quot; I broke in, sympathizingly, &quot;what a pity it is that he
						could n&apos;t have had such advantages earlier in life,&quot; and as I recalled the
						broad brogue of the fellow, together with his careless dress, recognizing beneath in all
						the native talent and brilliancy of a mind of most uncommon worth, I could not restrain
						a deep sigh of comparison and regret.</p>
					<p>The Major was leaning forward in the gathering dusk, and evidently studying my own
						face, the expression of which, at that moment, was very grave and solemn, I am sure. He
						suddenly threw himself backward in his chair, I just can&apos;t keep it up any
						longer,&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
					<pb id="VAA2379-143" n="154"/>
					<p>&quot;Keep what up?&quot; I queried, in a perfect maze of bewilderment and surprise.
						&quot;Keep what up?&quot; I repeated.</p>
					<p>&quot;Why, all this twaddle, farce, travesty and by-play regarding Tommy! You know I
						warned you, over and over, and you must n&apos;t blame me for the deception. I never
						thought you &apos;d take it so in earnest!&quot; and here the jovial Major again went
						into convulsions of laughter.</p>
					<p>&quot;But I don&apos;t understand a word of it all,&quot; I cried, half frenzied with
						the gnarl and tangle of the whole affair. &quot;What &apos;twaddle, farce and
						by-play,&apos; is it anyhow?&quot; And in mv vexation, I found myself on my feet and
						striding nervously up and down the paved walk that joined the street with the piazza,
						pausing at last and confronting the Major almost petulantly. &quot;Please explain,&quot;
						I said, controlling my vexation with an effort.</p>
					<p>The Major arose. &quot;Your striding up and down there reminds me that a little stroll
						on the street might do us both good,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you wait until I get a
						coat and hat?&quot;</p>
					<p>He rejoined me a moment later, and we passed through the open gate; and saying,
						&quot;Let&apos;s go down this way,&quot; he took my arm and turned into a street, where,
						cooling as the dusk was, the thick maples lining the walk, <pb id="VAA2379-144" n="155"
						/> seemed to throw a special shade of tranquil-ity upon us.</p>
					<p>&quot;What I meant was&quot;began the Major, in low, serious voice,&quot;What I meant
						was simply this: Our friend Tommy, though the truest Irishman in the world, is a man
						quite the opposite everyway of the character he has appeared to you. All that rich
						brogue of his is assumed. Though he&apos;s poor, as I told you, when he came here, his
						native quickness, and his marvelous resources, tact, judgment, business qualitiesall
						have helped him to the the humorous and the ridiculous is unbounded; such times is as
						dignified and refined in speech and. He is a good speaker, can stir a political
						convention to fomentation when he gets fired up; and can write an article for the press
						that goes spang to the spot. He gets into a great many personal encounters of a rather
						undignified character; but they are almost invariably bred of his innate interest in the
						&apos;under dog,&apos; and the fire and tow of his impetuous nature.&quot;</p>
					<p>My companion had paused here, and was looking through some printed slips in his
						pocket-book. &quot;I wanted you to see some of <pb id="VAA2379-145" n="156"/> the
						fellow&apos;s articles inprint, but I have nothing of importance hereonly some of his
						&apos;doggerel,&apos; as he calls it, and you&apos; ve had a sample of that. But
						here&apos;s a bit of the upper spirit of the manand still another that you should hear
						him recite. You can keep them both if you care to. The boys all fell in love with that
						last one, particularly, hearing his rendition of it. So we had a lot printed, and I have
						two or three left. Put these two in your pocket and read at your leisure.&quot;</p>
					<p>But I read them there and then, as eagerly, too, as I append them here and now. The
						first is called</p>

					</lg>
					<p>&quot;Before we turn back, now,&quot; said the smiling Major, as I stood lingering over
						the indefinable humor of the last refrain, &quot;before we turn back I want to show you
						something eminently characteristic. Come this way a half dozen steps.&quot;</p>
					<p>As he spoke I looked up, to first observe that we had paused before a handsome square
						brick residence, centering a beautiful smooth <pb id="VAA2379-148" n="159"/> lawn, its
						emerald only littered with the light gold of the earliest autumn leaves. On either side
						of the trim walk that led up from the gate to the carved stone ballusters of the broad
						piazza, with its empty easy chairs, were graceful vases, frothing over with late
						blossoms, and wreathed with laurel-looking vines; and, luxuriantly lacing the border of
						the pave that turned the further corner of the house, blue, white and crimson, pink and
						violet, went fading in perspective as my gaze followed the gesture of the
						Major&apos;s.</p>
					<p>&quot;Here, come a little further. Now do you see that man there?&quot;</p>
					<p>Yes, I could make out a figure in the deepening duskthe figure of a man on the back
						stoopa tired looking man, in his shirt-sleeves, who sat upon a low chairno, not a
						chairan empty box. He was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees, and the hands
						dropped limp. He was smoking, too, I could barely see his pipe, and but for the odor of
						very strong tobacco, would not have known he had a pipe. Why does the master of the
						house permit his servants to so desecrate this beautiful home? I thought.</p>
					<p>&quot;Well, shall we go now?&quot;said the Major.</p>
					<p>I turned silently and we retraced our steps. <pb id="VAA2379-149" n="160"/> I think
						neither of us spoke for the distance of a square.</p>
					<p>&quot;Guess you did n&apos;t know the man there on the back porch?&quot;said the
						Major.</p>
					<p>&quot;No; why? &quot;I asked dubiously.</p>
					<p>&quot;I hardly thought you would, and besides the poor fellow&apos;s tired, and it was
						best not to disturb him,&quot; said the Major.</p>
					<p>&quot;Why; who was itsome one I know?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;It was Tommy.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said I, inquiringly, &quot;he&apos;s employed there in some
						capacity?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean it?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;I certainly do. He owns it, and made every cent of the money that paid for
						it!&quot; said the Major proudly. &quot;That&apos;s why I wanted you particularly to
						note that &apos; eminent characteristic&apos; I spoke of. Tommy could just as well be
						sitting, with a fine cigar, on the front piazza in an easy chair, as, with his dhudeen,
						on the back porch, on an empty box, where every night you &apos;ll find him. Its the
						unconscious dropping back into the old ways of his father, and his father&apos;s father,
						and his father&apos;s father&apos;s father. In brief, he sits there the poor lorn symbol
						of the long oppression of his race.&quot;</p>

					<head>The Gilded Roll</head>

					<head>THE GILDED ROLL.</head>
					<p>
						<hi rend="b">N</hi>OSING around in an old boxpacked away, and lost to memory for yearsan
						hour ago I found a musty package of gilt paper, or rather, a roll it was, with the
						green-tarnished gold of the old sheet for the outer wrapper, I picked it up mechanically
						to toss it into some obscure corner, when, carelessly lifting it by one end, a
						child&apos;s tin whistle dropped therefrom and fell tinkling on the attic floor. It lies
						before me on my writing table nowand so, too, does the roll entire, though now a roll no
						longer,for my eager fingers have unrolled the gilded covering, and all its precious
						contents are spread out beneath my hungry eyes.</p>
					<p>Here is a scroll of ink-written music. I don&apos;t read music, but I know the dash and
						swing of the pen that rained it on the page. Here is a letter, with the self-same
						impulse and abandon in every syllable; and its melodyhowever sweet the otheris far more
						sweet to me. And here are other letters like itthreefiveand seven, at least. Bob wrote
						them from the front, and Billy kept them for <pb id="VAA2379-172" n="186"/> me when I
						went to join him. Dear boy! Dear boy!</p>
					<p>Here are some cards of bristol-board. Ah! when Bob came to these there were no blotches
						then. What faceswhat expressions! The droll, ridiculous, good-for-nothing genius, with
						his &quot;sad mouth,&quot; as he called it, &quot;upside down,&quot; laughing alwaysat
						everything, at big rallies, and mass-meetings and conventions, country fairs, and floral
						halls, booths, water-melon-wagons, dancing tents, the swing, Daguerrean-car, the
						&quot;lung-barometer,&quot; and the air-gun man. Oh! what a gifted, good-for-nothing boy
						Bob was in those old days! And here&apos;s a picture of a girlish facea very faded
						photographeven fresh from &quot;the gallery,&quot; five and twenty years ago it was a
						faded thing. But the living facehow bright and clear that was!for &quot;Doc,&quot;
						Bob&apos;s awful name for her, was a pretty girl, and brilliant, clever, lovable every
						way. No wonder Bob fancied her! And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness in
						every fairy face he drew, and you could find her happy ways and dainty tastes
						unconsciously assumed in all he didthe books he readthe poems he admired, and those he
						wrote; and, ringing clean and pure and jubilant, the vibrant beauty of her voice could
						clearly be defined and traced <pb id="VAA2379-173" n="187"/> through all his music. Now,
						there&apos;s the happy pair of themBob and Doc. Make of them just whatever your good
						fancy may dictate, but keep in mind the stern, relentless ways of destiny.</p>
					<p>You are not at the beginning of a novel, only at the threshold of one of a hundred
						experiences that lie buried in the past, and this particular one most happily
						resurrected by these odds and ends found in the gilded roll.</p>
					<p>You see, dating away back, the contents of this package, mainly, were hastily gathered
						together after a week&apos;s visit out at the old Mills farm; the gilt paper, and the
						whistle, and the pictures, they were Billy&apos;s; the music pages, Bob&apos;s, or
						Doc&apos;s; the letters and some other manuscript were mine.</p>
					<p>The Mills girls were great friends of Doc&apos;s and often came to visit her in town;
						and so Doc often visited the Milk&apos;s. This is the way that Bob first got out there,
						and won them all, and &quot;shaped the thing&quot; for me, as he would put it; and
						lastly, we had lugged in Billy,such a handy boy, you know, to hold the horses on picnic
						excursions, and to watch the carriage and the luncheon, and all that.Yes, and,&quot; Bob
						would say, &quot;such a serviceable boy in getting all the fishing tackle in proper
						order, and digging <pb id="VAA2379-174" n="188"/> bait, and promenading in our wake up
						and down the creek all day, with the minnow-bucket hanging on his arm, do n&apos;t you
						know!&quot;</p>
					<p>But jolly as the days were, I think jollier were the long evenings at the farm. After
						the supper in the grove, where, when the weather permitted, always stood the table,
						ankle-deep in the cool green plush of the sward; and after the lounge upon the grass,
						and the cigars, and the new fish stories, and the general invoice of the old ones, it
						was delectable to get back to the girls again, and in the old &quot;best room &quot;hear
						once more the lilt of the old songs and the stacattoed laughter of the piano mingling
						with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills girls, and the gallant soprano of the
						dear girl Doc.</p>
					<p>This is the scene I want you to look in upon, as, in fancy, I do nowand here are the
						materials for it all, husked from the gilded roll:</p>
					<p>Bob, the master, leans at the piano now and Doc is at the keys, her glad face often
						thrown up sidewise toward his own. His face is boyishfor there is yet but the ghost of a
						mustache upon his lip. His eyes are dark and clear, of over-size when looking at you,
						but now their lids are drooped above his violin, whose melody has, for the time, almost
							<pb id="VAA2379-175" n="189"/> smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners of his
						mouth. And wonderfully quiet now is every one, and the chords of the piano, too, are low
						and faltering; and so, at last, the tune itself swoons into the universal hush, andBob
						is rasping, in its stead, the ridiculous, but marvelously perfect imitation of the
						&quot;priming &quot;of a pump, while Billy&apos;s hands forget the &quot;chiggers
						&quot;on the bare backs of his feet, as, with clapping palms, he dances round the room
						in ungovernable spasms of delight. And then we all laugh; and Billy, taking advantage of
						the general tumult, pulls Bob&apos;s head down and whispers, &quot;Git &apos;em to stay
						up &apos;way late to-night I&quot; And Bob, perhaps remembering that we go back home
						to-morrow, winks at the little fellow and whispers, &quot;You let me manage &apos;em 1
						Stay up till broad daylight if we take a notioneh?&quot; And Billy dances off again in
						newer glee, while the inspired musician is plunking a banjo imitation on his enchanted
						instrument, which is unceremoniously drowned out by a circus-tune from Doc that is
						absolutely inspiring to everyone but the barefooted brother, who drops back listlessly
						to his old position on the floor and sullenly renews operations on his
						&quot;chigger&quot; claims.</p>
					<p>&quot;Thought you was goin&apos; to have pop-corn <pb id="VAA2379-176" n="190"/>
						to-night all so fast!&quot; he says, doggedly, in the midst of a momentary lull that has
						fallen on a game of whist. And then the oldest Mills girl, who thinks cards stupid
						anyhow, says: &quot;That&apos;s so, Billy; and we&apos;re going to have it, too; and
						right away, for this game&apos;s just ending, and I shan&apos;t submit to being bored
						with another. I say &apos; pop-corn&apos; with Billy! And after that,&quot; she
						continues, rising and addressing the party in general, &quot;we must have another
						literary and artistic tournament, and that&apos;s been in contemlation and preparation
						long enough; so you gentleman can be pulling your wits together for the exercises, while
						us girls see to the refreshments.&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Have you done anything toward it!&quot; queries Bob, when the girls are gone,
						with the alert Billy in their wake.</p>
					<p>&quot;Just an outline,&quot; I reply. &quot;How with you?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Clean forgot itthat is, the preparation; but I &apos;ve got a little old
						second-hand idea, if you &apos;ll all help me out with it, that &apos;ll amuse us some,
						and tickle Billy I&apos;m certain.&quot;</p>
					<p>So that&apos;s agreed upon and while Bob produces his portfolio, drawing paper, pencils
						and so on, I turn to my note-book in a dazed way and begin counting my fingers in a
						depth of profound abstraction, from which I am <pb id="VAA2379-177" n="191"/> barely
						aroused by the reappearance of the girls and Billy.</p>
					<p>&quot;Goody, goody, goody! Bob&apos;s goin&apos; to make pictures! &quot;cries Billy,
						in additional transport to that the cake pop-corn has produced.</p>
					<p>&quot;Now, you girls,&quot; says Bob, gently detaching the affectionate Billy from one
						leg and moving a chair to the table, with a backward glance of intelligence toward the
						boy,you girls are to help us all you can, and we can all work; but, as I &apos;11 have
						all the illustrations as you canthat &apos;ll be easy, you know,because the work entire
						is just to consist of a series of fool-epigrams, such as, for instance.Listen,
						Billy:</p>
					<lg>
						<l n="1">Here lies a young man</l>
						<l n="2">Who in childhood began</l>
						<l n="3" rend="ti-1">To swear, and to smoke, and to drink,</l>
						<l n="4">In his twentieth year</l>
						<l n="5">He quit swearing and beer,</l>
						<l n="6" rend="ti-1">And yet is still smoking, I think.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<p>And the rest of his instructions are delivered in lower tones, that the boy may not
						hear and then all matters seeminglv arranged, he turns to the boy with&quot;And now,
						Billy, no lookin&apos; over shoulders, you know, or swinging on my chair-back while
						I&apos;m at work. When the pictures are all finished, <pb id="VAA2379-178" n="192"/>
						then you can take a squint at &apos;em, and not before. Is that all hunky,
						now?&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh! who&apos;s a-goin&apos; to look over your shoulderonly <hi rend="i"
							>Doc.&quot;</hi> And as the radiant Doc hastily quits that very post, and dives for
						the offending brother, he scrambles under the piano and laughs derisively.</p>
					<p>And then a silence falls upon the group-a gracious quiet, only intruded upon by the
						very juicy and exuberant munching of an apple from a remote fastness of the room, and
						the occasional thumping of a bare heel against the floor.</p>
					<p>At last I close my note-book with a half slam.</p>
					<p>&quot;That means,&quot; says Bob, laying down his pencil, and addressing the
						girls,&quot;That means he&apos;s concluded his poem, and that he&apos;s not pleased with
						it in any manner, and that he intends declining to read it, for that self-acknowledged
						reason, and that he expects us to believe every affected word of his entire
						speech-&quot;</p>
					<p>&quot;Oh, don&apos;t!&quot; I exclaim.</p>
					<p>&quot;Then give us the wretched production, in all its hideous deformity!&quot;</p>
					<p>And the girls all laugh so sympathetically, and Bob joins them so gently, and yet with
						a tone, I know, that can be changed so quickly <pb id="VAA2379-179" n="193"/> to my
						further discomfiture, that I arise at once and read, without apology or excuse, this
						primitive and very callow poem recovered here to-day from the gilded roll:</p>
					<lg>
						<head>A BACKWARD LOOK.</head>
						<l n="1">As I sat smoking, alone, yesterday,</l>
						<l n="2" rend="ti-1">And lazily leaning back in my chair,</l>
						<l n="3">Enjoying myself in a general way-</l>
						<l n="4">Allowing my thoughts a holiday</l>
						<l n="5" rend="ti-1">From werriness, toil and care,</l>
						<l n="6">My fanciesdoubtless, for ventilation</l>
						<l n="7" rend="ti-1">Left ajar the gates of my mind,</l>
						<l n="8">And Memory, seeing the situation,</l>
						<l n="9" rend="ti-1">Slipped out in street of &quot;Auld Lang Syne.&quot;</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="10">Wandering ever with tireless feet</l>
						<l n="11" rend="ti-1">Through scenes of silence, and jubilee</l>
						<l n="12">Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet</l>
						<l n="13">Were throning the shadowy side of the street</l>
						<l n="14" rend="ti-1">As far as the eye could see;</l>
						<l n="15">Dreaming again, in anticipation,</l>
						<l n="16" rend="ti-1">The same old dreams of our boyhood&apos;s day</l>
						<l n="17">That never come true, from the vague sensation</l>
						<l n="18" rend="ti-1">Of walking asleep in the world&apos;s strange ways.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="19">Away to the house where I was born!</l>
						<l n="20" rend="ti-1">And there was the selfsame clock that ticked</l>
						<l n="21">From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,</l>
						<l n="22">When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn</l>
						<l n="23" rend="ti-1">And helped when the apples were picked.</l>
						<l n="24">And the &quot;chany-dog&quot; on the mantel-shelf,</l>
						<l n="25" rend="ti-1">With the gilded collar and yellow eyes,</l>
						<l n="26">Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself</l>
						<l n="27" rend="ti-1">Sound asleep with the dear surprise.</l>
					</lg>
					<pb id="VAA2379-180" n="194"/>
					<lg>
						<l n="28">And down to the swing in the locust tree,</l>
						<l n="29" rend="ti-1">Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground,</l>
						<l n="30">And where &quot;Eck&quot; Skinner, &quot;Old&quot; Carr, and three</l>
						<l n="31">Or four such other boys used to be</l>
						<l n="32" rend="ti-1">Doin&apos;&quot;sky-scrapers,&quot; or &quot;whirlin&apos;
							round:&quot;</l>
						<l n="33">And again Bob climbed for the bluebird&apos;s nest,</l>
						<l n="34" rend="ti-1">And again &quot;had shows&quot; in the buggy-shed</l>
						<l n="35">Of Guymon&apos;s barn, where still, unguessed</l>
						<l n="36" rend="ti-1">The old ghosts romp through the best days dead</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="37">And again I gazed from the old school-room</l>
						<l n="38" rend="ti-1">With a wistful look of a long June day,</l>
						<l n="39">When on my cheek was the hectic bloom</l>
						<l n="40">Caught of Mischief, as I presume</l>
						<l n="41" rend="ti-1">He had such a &quot;partial&quot; way,</l>
						<l n="42">It seemed, toward me.And again I thought</l>
						<l n="43" rend="ti-1">Of a probable likelihood to be</l>
						<l n="44">Kept in after schoolfor a girl was caught</l>
						<l n="45" rend="ti-1">Catching a note from me.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l n="46">And down through the woods to the swimming-hole</l>
						<l n="47" rend="ti-1">Where the big, white, hollow, old sycamore grows,</l>
						<l n="48">And we never cared when the water was cold,</l>
						<l n="49">And always &quot;ducked&quot; the boy that told</l>
						<l n="50" rend="ti-1">On the fellow that tied the clothes.</l>
						<l n="51">When life went so like a dreamy rhyme,</l>
						<l n="52" rend="ti-1">That it seems to me now that then</l>
						<l n="53">The world was having a jollier time</l>
						<l n="54" rend="ti-1">Than it ever will have again.</l>
					</lg>
					<p>The crude production is received, I am glad to note, with some expressions of favor
						from the company, though Bob, of course, must heartlessly dissipate my weak delight by
						saying, &quot;Well, it&apos;s certainly bad enough; though,&quot; he goes on with an air
						of deepest critical <pb id="VAA2379-181" n="195"/> sagacity and fairness,
						&quot;considered, as it should be, justly, as the production of a jour-poet, why, it
						might be worsethat is, a little</p>
					<p>&quot;Probably,&quot; I remember saying,&quot;Probably I might redeem myself by reading
						you this little amateurish bit of verse, enclosed to me in a letter by mistake, not very
						long ago.&quot; I here fish an envelope from my pocket the address of which all
						recognize as in Bob&apos;s almost printed writing. He smiles vacantly at itthen vividly
