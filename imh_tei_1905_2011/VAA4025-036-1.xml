            <byline>WALTER B. HENDRICKSON</byline>
            <p>In the eighteen-thirties, Indiana, as well as other western states, was feeling growing pains. The
                    elevation of Andrew Jackson to the presidency had made westerners feel that their importance to the
                    nation was at last recognized. A combination of circumstances had caused a business boom that was
                    quickening the economic life of all the western states. By 1834, new settlers by the tens of
                    thousands were pouring into the regions of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, creating farms and building towns. The people of the West could see a glorious
                    future; the people were coming, the land was rich, and other natural resources were at hand. All
                    that was needed was time and money to realize on what were considered the essential elements of all
                    great and prosperous states.</p>
            <p>The decade of the eighteen-thirties was one of great and enthusiastic promotion of farming, mining
                    and transportation facilities. In order that a state might take its place in the sun, the first move
                    to be made was the creation of adequate systems of communication to bridge the gap between producer
                    and consumer—getting the products of western farms to eastern markets. Accordingly, state
                    legislatures appropriated large sums of money for the building of canals and roads, and, with great
                    energy, ditches were dug, forests were cut down, and streams were dredged in order to make new
                    highways of commerce.</p>
            <p>Along with this great internal improvement movement, and in some ways contradictory to it, was a
                    movement in the western states to develop their own resources, so that they would be independent of
                    the East for mineral products. <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-036-1-008"/> If westerners could supply their
                    own needs for such things as iron and coal, the money that went to the East would be spent at home,
                    thus increasing local wealth. The needs of the growing cities would be met by locating and utilizing
                    local deposits of building stone, potters' clay, and sand and gravel. The immediate capital
                    to develop these natural resources could be supplied by eastern capitalists, who should, it was
                    believed, jump at the opportunity of making profitable investments as soon as they were informed of
                    the fact that the west contained potential wealth in its rocks and soils. This point of view was
                    well expressed by the report of the state senate committee on education, when the matter of creating
                    a geological survey came before the legislature in 1836: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Indiana is just launching into a general system of internal improve- ments, which if properly
                            prosecuted must shortly give her an elevated rank in the Union. Her local position is a
                            proud one—her outlines such as to secure for her, under wise legislation, and at
                            no distant day, a decided prominence as an independent state. We are about to expend
                            millions in the construction of canals, railroads, turnpikes, etc… Connected with
                            this, it occurs to your committee that an accurate examination of the geology of the country
                            is absolutely necessary to the successful prosecution of our public works. Such an
                            examination would impart life and vigor to the plan—indeed without it, we should
                            labor under a thousand difficulties, which such a survey would diminish, if not remove. The
                            peculiar character of the country and soil on the various routes selected for improvement,
                            "the presence of valuable ores, with the localities and extent of quarries, and of
                            coal and lime formations, objects of inquiry so essential to internal improvements, and the
                            advantage of domestic prosperity, would be discovered, and the possession and advantages of
                            them given to the public … ."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>The result of this line of reasoning was that there was a sudden awareness of the necessity
                    for trained men to discover and to locate the mineral wealth of the western states, and thus it was
                    that scientists, especially the geologists, took on a new importance in the eyes of progressive
                    westerners.</p>
            <p>Indiana was certainly one of the most active states in this movement for exploring natural resources.
                    The first state geological surveys had been in the East, where the importance of geology had long
                    been stressed by pioneer teachers of the science in eastern universities. As a result of this

            </p>
            <p>The first official notice of the need for a geological survey in Indiana was in 1830. At this time, a
                    resolution was passed in the state senate providing that the committee on education should
                    investigate the feasibility of appointing a professor of geology and mineralogy at the state college
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who would devote a part of his time to the making of a "thorough geological
                    examination of our state … and report all the useful discoveries for the practical
                    benefit of the country."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The committee reported that the funds of the
                    college were insufficient for such purposes, and there the matter of a geological survey rested
                    until 1835.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that year, Governor Noah Noble, in his message to the legislature in December, asserted that he
                    had become aware of the desirability of a geological and topographical survey of the state, when he
                    had talked to a gentleman who had found indications of coal in the neighborhood of the National
                    Road. Governor Noble urged that the need for a correct map of the state, and the desirability of
                    information about the natural resources of the state, could very well be met by appointing an agent.
                    He especially urged that the mineral deposits be investigated, saying that "without the aid
                    and application of geological science," those deposits would never be developed.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this was a new venture for the legislature to consider, and the members evidently doubted the
                    ability of the state to carry it through alone. A joint resolution of the two houses provided that
                    the governor should correspond with the governors of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, to learn whether those states would be willing to coöperate with Indiana in
                    a joint survey of the three states. Further, Governor Noble was directed to consult with
                    "one or more eminent geologists in the TJnited States in regard to the
                        subject."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Governor Noble himself was entirely convinced of the necessity and desirability of the geological

            <p>The governor proceeded to appoint a man of "talents, integrity, and suitable scientific
                    acquirements." This man was David Dale Owen, and it is quite probable that the Governor had
                    him in mind for the office even before the passage of the act. Noble had often visited in <placeName>

            <p>David Dale was an earnest young man, who had equipped a remarkable laboratory and museum in <placeName>

                    branches of the science of geology. He had made up his mind that this newest of sciences was the
                    most interesting. In 1836, he had accompanied his friend, Gerard Troost, on a survey in the

                    </placeName> as early as October of 1836, before the legislature met, that there was a movement on
                    foot for a survey, and that David Dale Owen would probably secure the position of state
                        geologist.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> It seems improbable that Owen himself did not know of it, and
                    perhaps the voluntary service on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> survey was a specific preparation for the Indiana survey.</p>
            <p>Whatever behind-the-scenes moves actually took place, the first official notice that David Dale Owen
                    received of his appointment came when his commission arrived from the Secretary of State, and that
                    was dated March 31, 1837.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Owen assumed his duties immediately, and this fact
                    lends weight to the opinion that he had been long expecting the appointment, and already had his
                    plans of operation well worked out.</p>
            <p>As Owen saw the problem, the first object was to "gain a correct and connected idea of the
                    whole, before spending much time in detailed examination of any particular spot."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> With this object in mind, the geologist left <placeName>

                    </placeName> river, and then traveled up that river, through all its meanderings, to the
                    southeastern corner of the state, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn county</region>

                    succession of the underlying strata, which he could do by observing the exposed rocks in the bluffs
                    of the river. He was thus able to gain a good idea of the geological formations all along the
                    southern boundary of the state. With this knowledge, he was ready to go into the interior of the
                    state, and determine just how far the various formations that he had observed along the <placeName>

                    the whole of the southern and central parts of the state. He ran the first line from <placeName>

                    the coal basin, and have upheld Owen's theory of a great central coal field.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

            <p>Not only did Owen point out to the citizens of the state the area in which they might expect to find
                    coal, but he showed them a means whereby they could determine whether or not they had dug deep
                    enough to find it. He adopted a discovery of Dr. Troost's that no coal could be found below
                    a limestone which contained a particular fossil. Once a coal miner found himself in the midst of
                    this limestone, he would know that it was useless to dig deeper.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In discussing
                    coal mining, Owen took the opportunity to point out the importance of consulting a geologist before
                    any mining was done, so that a scientific opinion could be given on the chances of finding coal in a
                    particular spot. He told the story of a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> landowner who observed lignite scattered over the surface of his fields, and knowing it
                    to be imperfect coal, he immediately presumed that solid coal would be found below the surface. He
                    hired an experienced miner from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and invested $20,000 in sinking a shaft for a mine. Over the protests of a
                    scientist of the neighborhood, who was aware of the character of the underlying formations, the
                    landowner continued operations, and, of course, was disappointed in finding no coal,<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Owen also had a word of warning for those residents of southern Indiana who mistook a black,

                    geologically, the shale was below the Archimedes limestone, and so could not possibly be coal; in
                    the second place, the only reason that it burned was because of its high sulphur and bitumin

                    least, had more than an abstract and theoretical value, and could be practically useful in an
                    economic way. His whole viewpoint on the purposes of the state geological survey was clearly stated
                    by him: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have considered it my duty, while surveying a country as new as ours, to remember that a
                            state just settling, is like a young man just starting out in life, whom it behooves to
                            secure for himself a competency, before he indulges in unproductive fancies. I have
                            considered it the most important object to search out the hidden resources of the state, and
                            open new fields of enterprize to her citizens. That object effected, time enough will remain
                            to institute inquiries (which a liberal policy forbids us to overlook) of a less productive
                            and abstract character; inquiries which are interesting in a scientific, rather than a
                            commercial point of view.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Because of this attitude, Owen did not spend a great deal of time investigating the coal measures of
                    Indiana, probably because, at that time, coal was not as economically important as it was later to
                    become, since there remained much uncuttimber to serve the people as fuel both for home use and for
                        manufacturing.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> What seemed of more importance to Owen was the location and
                    extent of possible sources of iron ore. He said that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>when there was any possibility of discovering a valuable deposit of iron, I instituted a more
                            particular investigation in such localities: believing that a good iron bank is of more
                            intrinsic value to the State than a mine of gold or silver.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>He was no doubt disappointed, because he found no very large deposits of ore, but he was
                    able to locate sizable quantities of brown oxide of iron, which, although not the best ore, would
                    justify the establishment of smelters.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other principal resource of Indiana which Owen investigated at some length was building stone.
                    Although he appreciated the fact that oölitic limestone was to be found in great
                    quantities, he does not seem to have recognized the potentialities of the greatest limestone region
                    of the state. Most of his discussion of building stone was devoted to the quarries of southern and
                    southeastern Indiana, where he found good fossiliferous limestone.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>The field work of the survey occupied Owen through the summer and autumn of 1837. During that time,
                    he was almost constantly away from home, meeting new people, and visiting all points of geological
                    interest. After the completion of the fall trip to the northern part of the state, Owen prepared a
                    report of his work to submit to the legislature. This report was published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In December, 1837, he went to the capital to read proofs and to visit the members of
                    the legislature in the interests of having the survey renewed for another year. The trip from <placeName>

                    weather, bad roads and high water. On his arrival in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he found difficulty in securing lodging, since one of the principal taverns had closed
                    its doors. Finally he found a "snug little room to myself with a little open stove, and
                    just room to turn between the table and the bed."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The legislators were much interested in geology, and several of them asked Owen to lecture on the
                    subject. These invitations were made official by a resolution of the house of representatives,
                    offering to put the hall of the house at his disposal for as many evenings as he might desire to
                        lecture.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Owen borrowed some apparatus from a local doctor, and delivered
                    his lectures, as he himself reported, "with greater facility than I expected."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> His visit must have had a favorable effect on the legislature, because, in
                    spite of an effort on the part of the senate to repeal the act of 1837, the survey was continued for
                    another year, and Owen was duly re-appointed as state geologist on March 10, 1838.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            <p>During the spring and fall of the second year of the survey, field investigations were continued.
                    Having already made a general reconnaissance, he now devoted his time to a more detailed
                    investigation of geological formations and mineral resources. Instead of considering the extent of
                    formations, and running lines to determine their limits, he visited individual counties, and made
                    separate reports in regard to their geology and natural resources. He again traveled <list type="footnotes">

                    through a few of the northern counties.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> He composed for himself a series of
                    questions to be answered by investigation. He wanted to find out the best methods for mining coal;
                    to find out if Indiana possessed lead ore in any quantity; to discover where the best building stone
                    could be found; to learn what were the possibilities of finding salt springs. He was also interested
                    in solving some questions of a purely scientific character, chiefly, in what way did the geological
                    formations and deposits of Indiana agree with, and in what way did they differ from those of
                    neighboring states.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen sought the answers to these questions by investigating numerous bluffs of water courses, the
                    walls of wells, sheer sides of hills, caves, excavations for roads and canals. In fact, he studied
                    any place where he could get a glimpse of the rock formations. He located workable seams of coal,
                    sources of salt from springs, beds of clay and shale suitable for pottery and brick making, deposits
                    of iron ore, and outcrops of sandstone and limestone. He was particularly impressed by the
                    possibilities of developing iron manufacture in the central western part of the state in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermillion</region>
                    </placeName>, Parke and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> counties. Here Owen found the essential elements for iron manufacture: coal, limestone,
                    timber and ironore. He predicted that this area of the state would become the center of a large and
                    important iron smelting industry.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Further, he prophesied that, since the whole
                    of the coal area of the state was also the best mineral region of the state, it would eventually be
                    the seat of manufacturing and industry.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> These predictions were fulfilled to a
                    degree for a period. That is, until the development of the Mesabi iron ore fields, and the change
                    from river to rail transportation, much of Indiana's industry did center around <placeName>

                    the best way of determining whether there were possibilities of securing a productive source of
                    salt, was to compare the geologic formations of Indiana with those of a territory where salt was
                    secured in quantity. The regions about the valleys of the Kanawha and Muskingum rivers on either
                    side of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> were selected by Owen, because they were on the margin of coal producing regions, as
                    well as of brine springs, and so approximated central Indiana in geology.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Owen
                    realized that Indiana had always been handicapped in her development of the meat-packing industry by
                    a lack of local sources for salt manufacture. It had been necessary to import most of the salt used
                    from eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The best salt came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and of course entailed a heavy shipping charge, even after steamboats made upstream
                    freighting possible.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Owen concluded from his investigations that, since there
                    was salt in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, there would be salt in Indiana, because the character of the geological formations of
                    the two regions was very similar, and he declared that salt water would be found in the
                    south-central area of Indiana, which was on the border of the coal region.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Owen did other work in comparing the geology of 'Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and laid the foundation for his later work in defining the succession of geological
                    formations for the entire northern <placeName>

                    </placeName> valley. Because of its technicalities, this part of his report will not be considered.
                    Suffice it to say that Owen became the foremost western geologist, and present day geologists have
                    verified the general accuracy of his work.</p>
            <p>Owen never completed his task of surveying Indiana, although, at the time of his death, in 1860, he
                    was again engaged, as state geologist, in directing a detailed and thorough study of
                    Indiana's geology. In spite of a strong plea by Governor David Wallace to the legislature,
                    during the session of 1838-39, that the survey be continued,<hi rend="sup">44</hi> the state senate
                    did not take any action on his recommendation, while the house <list type="footnotes">

                    that Owen immediately ceased work on the survey, because he continued to carry on his activities
                    under the act of 1838 which did not expire for a year. He was recommissioned as state geologist on
                    June 7, 1839.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> In the session of 1839-1840, Governor Wallace again urged the
                    legislature to re-establish a geological survey, and again the legislature refused to take action,
                    although the house committee on agriculture made a favorable report for the revival of the
                        survey.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Apparently, the survey was not authorized because of the fact that
                    the country was in state of business depression, and the legislators wanted to keep the tax burden
                    as low as possible. Besides, the great internal improvement scheme, which Indiana had inaugurated in
                    1836, was costing far more than had been anticipated, and the legislators refused to spend money on
                    what must have seemed to many of them as a frivolous and unimportant use of state funds.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The results of Owen's survey of Indiana were embodied in his two reports. The first was
                    submitted to the legislature at the 1837-1838 session, and the second at the 1838-1839 session. Both
                    reports were printed by the state, and included in the <hi rend="i">Documentary Journal</hi>. Owen
                    made a series of maps and geological illustrations to accompany these reports, but they were never
                    published. The original illustrations were supposed to have been deposited in the State Library, but
                    they seem to have been lost. Owen's two modest little pamphlets, the first of thirty-four
                    pages, and the second of fifty-four pages, exhibit the thoroughness with which he investigated the
                    geology of the state, and are a tribute to his keenness of observation and his ability to draw
                    correct conclusions from his observations. Written in a simple and direct style, they were meant to
                    be understood by the layman, and the first report was prefaced by a short exposition of the
                    principles of geology, which is an excellent summary of the geological knowledge of the day.</p>

            <p>Owen was always conscious of the fact that he was a public servant, and never sacrificed the public
                    interest to his personal enthusiasm for science. Yet, he also believed that he had a mission to
                    perform, and that it was his duty to educate the people so that they would understand that geology,
                    while a science, was yet a practical science. Upon taking office as state geologist, he issued a
                    statement to the press, that in accordance with the act of the legislature, he would receive at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, any specimens of minerals or metals about which the citizens wished information. These
                    he would analyze during those periods when he was not in the field. In addition to this statutory
                    requirement, Owen invited any person to send him fossils, rock and mineral specimens of interest,
                    and especially urged engineers, miners, well-diggers and quarrymen to advance the interests of
                    science by being on the lookout for such material. He gave detailed instructions for the packing and
                    shipment of specimens and offered to pay transportation charges on all such material submitted to
                        him.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> There is a letter in existence which discloses that at least one
                    citizen of the state co-operated with him. The writer, Samuel H. Dowden of Dear born county, told
                    Owen about the various minerals on his farm, described fossils found in the creek bed, and offered
                    to send specimens.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In concluding his first report, State Geologist Owen made a series of suggestions to the legislature
                    as to the future conduct of the geological survey of the state. He advised that the state would find
                    it money well spent to institute an organization which would make a minute and detailed examination
                    of all the geological features of the state, including a topographical survey, the mapping of the
                    extent of all the formations within the state, and the analysis of all the coal, building stone, and
                    mineral deposits, and the thorough classification of all fossil remains. He recognized that such a
                    survey would cost both money and time, and although he said that the results would justify the
                    expenditure, he felt that a continuation of the plan under which his office was <list type="footnotes">

                    Indiana, one is impressed with their accuracy and fundamental correctness. His work has been the

                    and added details to his descriptions of the formations of the state, there have been very few of

                        great. The revenue which was necessary for the support of the new State government, was, for a
                        period of about twenty years, drawn almost wholly from the land-holders; and the funds required
                        for county purposes were derived, chiefly, from a poll tax, and taxes on lands, town lots,
                        horses, carriages, clocks, and watches, and from charges on licenses which were granted to the
                        vendors of merchandise, the retailers of spiritous liquors, and the keepers of taverns. For
                        revenue purposes, the taxable lands were classed as first rate, second rate, and third rate
                        lands. The taxes which were levied on such lands, for the support of the State government, were
                        not burdensome. For example, the rate of taxation on <hi rend="i">one hundred acres
                        was</hi>—</p>
                    <p>In 1817, on first rate land, $1.00; on second rate land, 87'fs cents; on
                        third rate land, 50 cents.</p>
                    <p>In 1818, on first rate land, $1.00; on second rate land, 87, cents; on third rates
                        land, 62% cents.</p>
                    <p>In 1821, on first rate land, $1.50; on second rate land, $1.25; on third
                        rate land, 75 cents.</p>
                    <p>In 1824, on first rate land, $1.50; on second rate land, $1.00; on third
                        rate land, 75 cents.</p>
                    <p>In 1831, on first rate land, 80 cents; on second rate land, 50 cents; on third rate land, 40
                        cents.</p>
                    <p>By an act of February 7, 1835, the general assembly made some provisions for the levying of taxes
                        on land, not according to its quality, but in proportion to its value; and every assessor was
                        required to appraise taxable land "as he would appraise the same in the payment of a
                        just debt due from a solvent debtor." The new mode of raising a State revenue by the
                        levying of a certain per centage on the value of taxable property, was, on its adoption, viewed
                        by many persons as a measure of doubtful expediency; but a large majority of the people soon
                        began to regard it as an equitable mode of taxation, and a part of the settled policy of the
                        State government.</p>

            <head>The Underground Railroad in Hendricks County</head>
            <byline>ROSCOE R. LEAK</byline>
            <p>All students of the slavery controversy between the states know something of the workings of the
                    Underground Railroad. Only a few know that Hendricks County, Indiana, had any particular part in
                    this very interesting work of aiding Negroes to escape to <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Practically all of these activities took place in the decade preceding the Civil War,
                    and many of those who took part in this work did not care to talk about it, even in later years.</p>
            <p>There was trouble over the rescue of slaves by their masters for many years. Then, in 1850, Congress
                    passed the famous amendment to the Fugitive Slave Law. Under this measure, any citizen was obliged,
                    if requested, to join in the capture of fugitive slaves. Those who believed in helping to free
                    run-away slaves were called abolitionists. The feeling between these and slave owners had been
                    aggravated by slave-dealers kidnapping free negroes and selling them. People who were
                    conscientiously opposed to slavery were very much concerned about such happenings, and, of course,
                    they did not want to help in recapturing slaves.</p>
            <p>Before 1850, there had been little organized opposition to slavery in the north. One direct result of
                    the new federal regulations in regard to fugitive slaves was the organization of the Anti-Slavery
                    League. This was a secret organization, having money back of it, with which to employ men to promote
                    ways for slaves to reach freedom. They laid out routes towards <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and directed slaves along them. Though this was in direct opposition to federal law,
                    many people were willing to take the risk for the cause which they believed to be right. Eastern
                    abolition agents took the lead in organizing Underground Railroad routes as they came to be called.
                    Most of the workers in this anti-slavery enterprise were stationed along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River to help slaves get started on friendly routes towards freedom. There were many
                    routes from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

            </p>
            <p>Some of the routes were variations of more important routes. Probably, two or three of the less
                    frequently used routes passed through Hendricks County. It is probable that <list type="footnotes">

                    probably several stations in the vicinity.</p>
            <p>People who took part in this work were inclined to keep the information concealed, even after the
                    trouble had passed into history. Only at two places in Hendricks County do we know just how the
                    stations were equipped for concealing the refugees. In the <hi rend="i">Reminiscence of Levi

                    order to show him the secret hiding place. This house was built in 1852 by Charles Rice who came
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. He selected a farm on a high ridge, partly covered with large sugar trees and other
                    fine timber. The place selected for the house commands a view of the surrounding country for many
                    miles north, east and south. The timber was mostly west and northwest of the house. The house still
                    stands but is in very poor condition. It is built colonial style with both east and south fronts. At
                    the time of its construction, it was presumed that what is now the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> division of the "Big Four" Railroad would pass near by on the south
                    of the house. For this reason, the house was built so that the south front would face the
                        railroad.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The east front faced the public highway. On this side of the
                    house are two long rows of pine trees that can be seen for miles. The house is about two miles west
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It is possible that Mr. Rice wanted the house so placed that it could be seen by those coming from
                    the south, particularly from the vacinity of Hadley, then called <hi rend="i">Mimosa</hi>. It is
                    said that a light was kept burning at night in a window where it could be seen for a long way. The
                    ell shaped house was built with the arms fifty and fifty-two feet. The rooms are twenty feet square.
                    There is a hall and stairway in the center on the south side which is twelve feet wide. There is
                    another stairway in the east wing. The upper floor is so arranged that there is no communication
                    between the east and south wings. Mr. Rice always kept a number of negroes to work for him. The men
                    were quartered in one upper wing and the women in the other. Extra negroes about the place would not
                    have attracted much attention among the neighbors.</p>
            <p>The west room on the main floor is the one that contained the secret closet where fleeing slaves were
                    hidden. This large rooni, had a fireplace in the west end that was built entirely within the outer
                    wall of the house, but instead of the usual presses or closets on either side of the fireplace the
                    west wall of the room was solid and the lines on either side just even with the fireplace. This made

                    outside the outer wall. The spaces on either side of the fireplace were plastered on the outer side
                    of the wall of the room to make them warm. There was left a room about three feet wide and twenty
                    feet long only partly divided in the middle by the chimney of the fireplace. The only way to reach
                    this long narrow partly divided room, it seems, was through a hole in the back of the fireplace
                    where bricks could be easily removed when no fire was burning, then replaced after used as an
                    entrance to the secret room. If those on guard feared a visit from searchers, a fire would be built
                    to allay all suspicion.</p>
            <p>There could have been a trap door into this secret room from the room above, but people who claim to
                    have known the house years ago say there was no such entrance. Others who visited at this house as
                    children in later years and played in this upper room do not know of any entrance to this space.</p>
            <p>It is possible to picture the quiet of the house on a dark night, with a candle dimly burning in the
                    window. Then there would be a stealthy knock at the door and a group of fleeing slaves, guided by
                    Addison Coffin, or some of his friends, would be admitted. After a hurried conversation, the negroes
                    would be told to crawl into the secret room and would be given food and maybe a candle for light. If

                    perhaps, when the guests were rested and it was safe to proceed farther, they were invited to leave
                    the hiding place and were oufitted with clothing and other necessaries for further travel. Then,
                    under the guidance of Mr. Rice, or some of his helpers, they were conducted to the next station.</p>
            <p>The nearest station to the north that is known was on the farm of Thomas Burgess. This farm was later
                    known as the Job Hadley farm. Mr. Burgess was the the father of Tracy (Burgess) Hadley, wife of Job

            <p>An old lady once told the writer, that, when a girl in her early teens, she had heard people say they
                    thought slaves were routed to this farm from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plainfield</settlement>

            <p>On this farm is an old frame barn which was built before the Civil War. It is much the same now that
                    it was then, and in it fugitive slaves are supposed to have been hidden. This barn was built with a
                    wooden floor in the driveway. There were stalls for the stock on either side. The hay from the mow
                    was thrown down into the driveway for feeding. In the floor was a trap door to a cellar or basement
                    that had no outside communication. Trash and hay hid this door except when in use, so a stranger
                    would never notice it. In later years, this cellar was used as a storage room for potatoes and other
                    things. Theodore Ogden, who lived on this farm in recent years, told writer that he tore out the
                    wooden floor and filled the cellar with dirt, as it had become unsafe. This barn is about three and
                    a half miles northeast of Lizton and, therefore, about twelve miles from the "White
                    House" built by Charles Rice. This secret barn-basement just described was situated quite

                    </placeName> two men who were destined to give to the world an institution which is truly American.
                    One of these men was Bishop John H. Vincent. When he was sixteen years of age, he became a circuit
                    riding minister of the Methodist Church. During the period of his active ministry, he held
                    pastorates in <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, where for two years he was the pastor of Ulysses S. Grant. Later, Rev. Vincent became
                    secretary to the organization directing the Methodist Episcopal Sunday Schools throughout the world.</p>
            <p>The second of these two worthy men was Lewis Miller. He was a slightly educated, but resourceful,
                    business man of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Akron</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, who made a fortune with the Buckeye Mower and Reaper. Mr. Miller is also remembered as
                    the father-in-law of the late Thomas A. Edison. It was through his influence that the first assembly
                    of the original Chautauqua was held in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Woods.</p>
            <p>The Chautauqua, as previously stated, owes its origin to John H. Vincent and Lewis Miller. The
                    movement was sponsored by the Methodist Episcopal Churches of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. Preparations were begun in the fall of 1873, as a result of the untiring efforts of
                    the cleric and the inventor. The aim from the start was to make the venture inter-denominational and
                    non-sectarian. This idea was carried out at the first session, when, although sponsored by the
                    Methodist Episcopal Churches, the audience was addressed by a Baptist, a Pres-byterian, a Methodist
                    and a Congregationalist. The first assembly, called "The Sunday School Teachers'
                    Assembly," was conducted for the purpose of better equipping Sunday School teachers for
                    their work of instruction. It was held at Fairport, on Chautauqua Lake in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, on Tuesday evening, August 4, 1874. The sessions were held in an outdoor auditorium,
                    lighted by pine fires.</p>
            <p>The sponsors of the movement were so encouraged by the attendance and interest manifested, that they
                    planned a second assembly to be held at the same place in 1875. There was no change in policy, and
                    dignity was lent to the second session by a visit of President Grant.</p>
            <p>The third assembly was conducted on the shores of <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-036-1-030"/> Chautauqua Lake
                    in 1876, the national centennial year. Many features were added to the program. It was during this
                    season that the first musical program, other than of a re-ligious nature, was given. Frances Willard
                    delivered the first address ever given by a woman on the Chautauqua platform. The first
                    children's work was done during this session and took the form of daily meetings.</p>
            <p>From this time on, the annual assemblies at Lake Chautauqua, expanded steadily, and embraced
                    lectures, music, children's work, round tables, study courses and reading circles. The
                    theory behind Chautaqua was that life as one and that religion belonged everywhere. The Chautauqua
                    idea called for a combination of liberal education with opportunity for recreational rest. The
                    Chautauqua made a plea for universal education, plans of reading and study, all legitimate
                    enticements and incitements to ambition, and all necessary adaptations as to time and topics.</p>
            <p>The citizens of Merom, Indiana, and vicinity realizing that a Chautauqua would fill a need in the
                    community which no other organization could fill, formed an association in 1905. This institution
                    served for many years as teacher, preacher and entertainer, and helped men and women, boys and
                    girls, to live better after than before it came. The programs were designed to give expression to
                    every influence for broader culture, better citizenship and higher ideals of living; to sponsor
                    vligious and moral reform and to take part in the dissemination of social propaganda. Therefore,
                    Merom established an organization and developed a program to be presented on the Bluff from August
                    16 to August 23, 1905.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This first session was arranged in a few weeks time by a temporary association formed to put the
                    matter to a test whether a Chautauqua Assembly would probably be successful at Merom. The response
                    was encouraging and left no doubt as to the possibility. In 1906, the first Articles of
                    In-corporation were legally filed and the Merom Bluff Chautauqua was, as an organization, launched
                    upon a lengthy and varied career of thirty years.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    three superintendents, each to head one of the three departments, grounds, sanitation and
                    transportation, which were created by the Association.</p>
            <p>The Merom Bluff Chautauqua was organized as an independent organization. It was not affiliated with
                    any lyceum bureau, church, school or other organization. Its only object was, and continued to be,
                    the dissemination of that broad culture and liberal education which leads to better citizenship and
                    higher standards of living. To this end, its managing board was chosen to represent the various
                    churches and political parties. It was not interested in any propaganda of social or political
                    doctrine, or of any religious creed or cult. The chief aim of the Association was to furnish
                    entertainment, rest and recreation. No mercenary motives gave rise to this Chautauqua, and any
                    effort to commercialize it would have been strenuously opposed at any time by the worthy individuals
                    who had the welfare of both the Chautauqua and community as their chief interest. Throughout the
                    years of its existence, every effort was put forth to keep it free from any connection that would
                    have made it subservient to the purposes of any other organization. As the institution was not
                    founded for profit, the Association's policy was to use all surplus funds to provide added
                    grounds and permanent improvements.</p>

                    were provided for the use of the Chautauqua "fans." In case the camper brought his
                    own tent, space was rented to him for two dollars for the duration of the Chautauqua. Throughout the
                    history of the Merom Chautauqua, it was necessary for all campers to provide their own blankets.
                    Such furnishings, however, as cots, stoves, camp chairs and tables might be had on the grounds at a
                    nominal rental charge. As early as 1919, the management of the Merom Bluff Chautauqua lighted the
                    tents by electricity which was supplied by a "Matthews" farm lighting plant,
                    rented from a Sullivan agency.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    fifty-six dollars and forty-three cents rental for the auditorium tent and the smaller camping
                    tents. Ten years later, the Association received four hundred thirty dollars and fifty cents rental
                    on the tents occupied by the visitors. In 1932 ten thousand four hundred ninety-seven square feet of
                    tenting was rented from the <placeName>

                    dollars and fifty cents. In 1914, the attendance having increased beyond all hopes, and there being
                    those who preferred hotel accommodations rather than camping facilities, the Harper property was
                    purchased, refurnished, and leased to Eleanor Foster of <placeName>

                    twenty-five dollars per season.</p>
            <p>Throughout the life of the Merom Bluff Chautauqua, the aim of the management was to provide the best
                    available talent at such a price as would be within the reach of all. The price of adult season
                    tickets varied from one dollar and twenty-five cents to three dollars and fifty cents. Season
                    tickets for children varied over a range of seventy-five cents to one and one-half dollars each.
                    Season tickets for both adults and children were transferable. In 1914, 3 day ticket, consisting of
                    morning, afternoon and evening coupons, was introduced. At the same time, a four day ticket was
                    offered to the Chautauqua patrons. Three hundred <list type="footnotes">

                    sold in 1915. These brought the committee the sum of seven hundred thirty-three dollars and forty
                    cents. In 1916, the directors voted to reserve five hundred forty daily tickets for those days on
                    which there were scheduled outstanding programs, and two hundred for each of the other days. The
                    rate for these reservations was one dollar per person for the season, or ten cents per session. The
                    following year, return checks were issued and sold for ten cents each. These seem to have been used
                    for a period of three years.</p>
            <p>Due to the fact that Merom Chautauqua officials spared no money or effort in order to secure the best
                    available talent, the attendance grew by leaps and bounds. This naturally increased the income as
                    well as the expenditures. In the year 1915, the total receipts were four thousand six hundred six
                    dollars and nineteen cents. In 1917, the ticket sales, tent rentals and concession rentals amounted
                    to nine thousand nine hundred forty dollars and thirty-one cents; in 1921, seven thousand four
                    hundred six dollars and nineteen cents; in 1922, six thousand eighteen dollars and thirty-six cents;
                    and in 1924, seven thousand four hundred seventy-three dollars and ninety-five cents. As a means of
                    comparison, there is included a statement of expenditures for the same years. For 1917, the total
                    expenditures were nine thousand nine hundred twenty-two dollars and forty-eight cents; in 1921, nine
                    thous-and ten dollars and one cent; in 1922, five thousand two hundred forty dollars and twenty
                    cents; and for 1924, seven thousand three hundred twenty-eight dollars and ninety-five cents.</p>
            <p>The extended success of the Merom Bluff Chautauqua, as was demonstrated by the length of time that it
                    continued its existence, was due to a series of factors. Some of these were: the interest which the
                    stockholders, directors and committee took in their patrons; the personality and intelligence of the
                    platform' managers; and the high quality talent of lecturers, musicians and entertainers

                    great and vital questions which have confronted the country since 1905. The children in the schools
                    have had a broader outlook on life, and a keener sense of appreciation of the existing conditions,
                    as well as a knowledge of the major events and questions of the past years. Certainly the managers
                    of the Chautauqua attempted, among other things, to bring information to the people and to stimulate

            <p>It was on a day in mid-August, 1836, that Crystal David William Scott, famed hunter, who for a year

                    to deposit the customary one dollar and a quarter an acre for a tract of two hundred twenty-eight
                    acres in what is now Liberty Township, White County.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The region in which the land lay was then just open for settlement. Less than two years before, a
                    board of commissioners appointed by the Indiana Legislature to undertake the organization of White
                    County had selected the site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName> as the seat of government and had given the place its name in honor of Thomas
                    Jefferson. In much of the surrounding country, affairs were even less advanced. In what afterwards
                    became <placeName>

                    </placeName> County, adjoining White County on the north, there were very few, if any, whites till
                    1830. A cabin was erected on the site of Winamac, its county seat, in 1837, and the town itself was
                    platted in 1839.</p>

                    </placeName> County, settlers were arriving in considerable numbers late in the eighteen-thirties.
                    The names of many of these hardy and honored pioneers, the forebears of many a well known family of
                    the two counties, are to be found on the markers of the old section of Clark Cemetery in Liberty
                    Township of White County.</p>
            <p>The cemetery carries with it an interesting story of pioneer life. Situated on a knoll above the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> River, it overlooked acres of native forest, with the river beyond and below. A more
                    beautiful and attractive spot for a burial ground could not have been found.</p>
            <p>It was not mere accident that brought about its selection. This plot was designated for a meeting
                    house and burial ground for what had been planned to be an important civic and shopping center. The
                    name chosen by Scott for the place was Wyoming. Having made purchase of the land in 1836,
                    Scott's title had been thus assured. By February, 1837, a patent in confirmation of his
                    title had not yet been issued to him, but the developments of those days were too rapid <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> at a ford above the rapids opposite Scott's land.</p>
            <p>It was this ford that had first attracted Scott, the hunter, to the lands which he acquired.
                    Previously, Scott's home had been in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Cass County</region>
                    </placeName>, adjoining the northern portion of White County to the east. While on his excursion
                    into the newly organized White County, his course led him to a village of the Pottawatomi Indians on
                    the eastern bank of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, some three miles west of the present hamlet of Sitka. It was one of two Indian
                    villages in White County that had been set up following the scattering of the tribesmen ofveral
                    Indian nations that had engaged in the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> in 1811. The Indian village comprised possibly a hundred wigwams, which furnished
                    habitation for some three or four hundred Indians. These subdued Pottatatomies were a friendly lot,
                    who obtained a living by hunting and fishing, begging and thieving, and from a few acres of Indian
                    corn farmed by the squaws. From this village, a trail led northward. In pursuit of game and in quest
                    of land, how joyous must have been Scott's departure as he followed the trail till it led
                    at last to the ford above the rapids. He had reached the land he would enter for settlement. It was
                    with an eye to the future that the lands which he purchased from the Government were all selected
                    along the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, and his choice was among the first.</p>
            <p>At this ford, Scott saw not the trail of the Pottawatomies but a mighty highway; in the swift running
                    stream, not mere fishing pools but a force that would turn the wheels of industry; in the forest and
                    on the hillside, not alone the haunt of the deer that he loved so well to follow but the lumber and
                    rich gravel deposits with which to build a city: This was truly a natural place for a town of
                    importance, and within a few months of his original purchase, and with the proposed state highway in
                    prospect, Scott had a preliminary survey of his land made and a plat drafted. His confidence in the
                    project was complete. On February 24, 1837, he wrote: "Wyoming is handsomely situated on

                    legislature of the state at its session of 1836-7. These commissioners filed their report with the
                    County Board of White County on September 4, 1837, but located the highway by another route than
                    Scott had contemplated—one that would cross the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> within the limits of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Forthwith Scott protested, and commissioners were then appointed by the White County
                    Board to re-view and re-locate the road as far as the White County portion was concerned. This move
                    did not avail. A rival route had won. There were, in consequence, no bidders for lots in the Town of
                    Wyoming, and Scott eventually abandoned the effort to promote a city there. For many years, however,
                    his home and the acreage he had reserved for a meeting house and burial ground formed a community
                    center.</p>
            <p>It was at the home of Crystal D. W. Scott, in 1837, that the first church of Liberty Township was
                    organized, a class of the New Light denomination, and, in his house, services were held for two
                    years. The founder of this church was Abram Sneathan, a circuit rider, who had himself entered land
                    in Liberty Township on October 10, 1836. In 1839, a meeting house for this church congregation was
                    built on the burial ground, a structure about twenty-five feet square of round logs of black oak.
                    This building served as church and public meeting place for a decade.</p>
            <p>Also at the home of Crystal D. W. Scott, there was held the first election of Liberty Township on
                    Monday, April 2. 1838. Records disclose twelve persons to have attended, including pioneers whose
                    influence has been lasting in <placeName>

                    </placeName> as well as in White County. The order of the board of county commissioners entered on
                    September 5, 1837, establishing Liberty Township, and under whose authority the election was held,
                    directed that all that portion of <placeName>

                    </placeName> County, yet unorganized, lying north of the newly organized township, be attached
                    thereto. This arrangement remained in force until the organization of Beaver Township which
                    organization occured in April, 1840. On the sixth day of <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-036-1-038"/> that
                    month, the first election of Beaver Township was held at the house of Asa Inman, with twenty-two
                    persons voting.</p>
            <p>Of the men attending these first elections, the graves of several in Clark Cemetery can be
                    identified, while the graves of many others of these groups cannot be, for want of records or
                    markers. There may be noted the plot of John McDowell, whose death is recorded as of March 16, 1850;
                    that of Charles M. Silence, who was the first white person to die in Beaver Township; that of Robert
                    Scott, whose headstone describes him as one of the first settlers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pulaski</settlement>
                    </placeName> County; that of Jesse Coppock, who served as a member of the first board of county
                    commissioners of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pulaski</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, and who died on January 12, 1851; and that of Robert White, Sr., one of the
                    largest landowners of the area in his day, and who departed this life during the period of the Civil
                    War.</p>
            <p>There are many graves of generations ago, each marked only by a small stone at the foot of the grave
                    to the east anda boulder at the head of the grave to the west, that a casual observer may pass
                    without notice. The pity is that the identification of great numbers of persons buried here is
                    impossible for no other reason than the fact that throughout the years there has been absolutely no
                    recording of the burials made in Clark Cemetery.</p>
            <p>The record of the Crystal D. W. Scott family, as disclosed by weather-worn markers, gives evidence of
                    the hardships shared by the pioneers, when skilled medical service was all but impossible to obtain:
                    an infant daughter, without name, died on August 27, 1838; Gabriel, a son, died on August 21, 1839;
                    Samuel, a son, died on January 21, 1841; Sally, a daughter, died on August 8, 1841; Polly, a
                    daughter, died on August 24, 1842; an infant daughter, without name, died on September 6, 1844;
                    David, a son, died on September 12, 1847. The wife and mother, Eliza Scott, at the age of
                    thirty-six, departed this life on August 30, 1854.</p>
            <p>Such were the beginnings of Clark Cemetery and of the political existence of Liberty and Beaver
                    Townships, all centering so largely around the life and activities of Crystal David William Scott
                    and the proposed settlement of Wyoming that he attempted to establish more than one hundred years
                        <hi rend="i">ago</hi>.</p>
            <p>Upon Scott's townsite of 1837, there stands a lone cabin of hewn black-oak logs, still in
                    regular use as a farm home. <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-036-1-039"/> It is one of the few remaining
                    examples of the sturdy construction of pioneer days, marking the spot that was once a center of
                    civic activity. The meeting house erected in 1839 was razed generations ago. What Scott denominated
                    "an elegant mill seat adjoining the town plat," on the banks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, was widely known and the grounds about it were used for years for picnics. These
                    grounds remain undisturbed except for trees that have been felled from time to time for construction
                    purposes, and replaced by growths of new forest.</p>
            <p>In the year 1850, the three acres occupied by Clark Cemetery were deeded by John Layman and Margaret
                    Layman, his wife, the then owners, to the board of commissioners of White County, and the cemetery
                    has since been maintained as a public burying ground. In the rush of work-a-day lives, people should
                    not forget that in the confines of old cemeteries, there rest the remains of men and women who
                    contributed largely to the well-being of the communities in which they lived in the past. While in
                    numerous cases, families have taken care of their own cemetery lots, the task has been made
                    discouraging because other lots, often large in extent, have been totally neglected. Headstones are
                    allowed to fall and remain in a state of ruin, while the whole place is over-grown with weeds.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> The care of ancient cemeteries may well be viewed as a sacred and public
                        trust. With an aroused public interest. Clark Cemetery can be transformed into a suitable
                        memorial to the life and work of those sturdy pioneers who did so much to shape the future of
                        two counties. The same statement can no doubt be applied with equal force to many other
                        cemeteries. Is not the time ripe for a movement in this direction?</item>

            <p>When my father, Joshua Griffith, was a child, he was called "Joshie." He never
                    tired of hearing his parents tell of the leave-taking from their <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> home; of the trip over mountains and through dense forests; of crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and going on to Marietta, where they spent the winter or 1800-1801. Glowing reports of
                    the fertile land of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> lured them to that State, and taking a trail north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River they crossed that stream to Limestone (Maysville) <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The trip in covered wagon through the sparsely settled state was visualized by
                    "Joshie" as his mother related the experiences crossing creeks, camping by night
                    along the way, driving over hills and rough roads until they reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shelbyville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At this place, they purchased land. The deed was made out to "William J.
                    Griffith and Wife—to have and to hold." Here my grandparents built a home and
                    other buildings were added. The land was cleared and fenced. After this, came evidence to them that
                    the deed was worthless.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, word had come from southern Indiana relatives telling of productive land and
                    pleasant surroundings. The Griffiths, discouraged but ambitious, decided to go thither and wended
                    their way to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River. They arrived at the home of a Mr. Maclntire, the boatman, on a gray, cold Autumn
                    morning and called to this river-man: "Come and set us across." The response came,
                    "I'm eating breakfast; you'll have to wait." The impatient
                    travelerurged, "I can't wait; I'm in a hurry." To which the
                    boatman retorted, "Then go around." Grandfather waited.</p>
            <p>The foregoing conversation took place on the site where Carrollton is now located. However, the
                    crossing was made and in a day or two they arrived at the home of Uncle John Sigmon on Parks Ridge (<placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County). Immediate steps were taken to purchase land; which resulted in securing the
                    farm now beautifully located on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Moorefield road, six and one half miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This farm was owned by the Griffith heirs for more than one hundred years. The first
                    home was built in time for the family to eat Christmas dinner there in 1817. Each lap of <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-036-1-041"/> their travels as told to "Joshie" was as interesting
                    to him as a tale from a child's storybook.</p>
            <p>About 1820, a more commodious home was erected. This was two stories high, though of log
                    construction. It was ceiled and weather-boarded. A great stone chimney with double fireplace
                    separated the kitchen and living room, with a hallway on one side and a kennel with an outside door
                    on the other side. The fireplace in the living-room was the largest I have ever seen and the mantle
                    over it the tallest. Even in mature years I was unable to see on top of it when I tip-toed.</p>
            <p>There was space on the second floor for three bedrooms; a winding stairway almost fan-shaped ascended
                    from the kitchen. On the turn, these steps were so narrow as to afford only a toe-hold and yet when
                    Susan, the family "hiredgirl," was to be married, she marched down the steps
                    arm-in-arm with the husband to-be. Wainscoting, painted dark green, adorned the living room and
                    downstairs bedroom. All other ceilings and walls were white. Each room had one window of twelve
                    panes, and white ash floors. Conveniently near was the covered well with windlass and old oaken
                    bucket, inviting travelers to quench their thirst. Typical of that time, there were rows of
                    gooseberry and currant bushes, clumps of sage, horseradish and rhubarb—with an abundance
                    of fruit trees. Surrounding the yard was a white picket fence with a stile by the gateway for ladies
                    to ascend in order to mount their horses. This was a home in which many guests were welcomed and
                    fed. Some of them were prosperous, more of them humble. Many were worthy—others perhaps
                    not.</p>
            <p>It was in this home that my father, the youngest child of William and Catherine Griffith, was born on
                    December 11, 1823. He was appropriately named Joshua after the Bible leader. From his casual
                    conversations of Iater years, his children glimpsed a few pictures of his childhood, which proved
                    that girls and boys of that day were not unlike those of the present time.</p>
            <p>His God-fearing parents who were of more than ordinary culture adhered strictly to the habit of
                    church attendance and their counsel was respected by their children. However, at a tender age, when
                    the service seemed unduly long one Sunday, "Joshie" suddenly rose and said:
                    "I'm tired and <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-036-1-042"/> I'm going home for
                    Nancy is making me some sweetcakes." A few years later when he was allowed to sit with his
                    brothers in the gallery one Sunday, the episode of two little lads trading (exchanging) trousers
                    took place. His mirth was so great that he was demoted to a seat with his parents for many
                    succeeding Sundays.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not at that time, nor for many years thereafter, were Sunday Schools connected with Church. But there
                    was an independent one near the present Todd home, two miles from the Griffith place.
                    "Joshie," about five years of age, with his big brothers, Tom and John, ventured
                    there one Sunday. The trip going was pleastant—with stretches of woodland along the way,
                    birds singing, squirrels darting up before them and above all the sense of a new adventure. How
                    different the return ! The sun blazed out and the way seemed long and dreary to the little lad who
                    had so bravely gone over the same road two hours before. "Joshie" began to
                    whimper, which induced Tom to threaten him with a spanking. But John, who was a natural manager of
                    men, said: "No wonder you are tired, ‘Joshie,’ after this long walk.
                    What you need is a fine horse to ride." Cutting a long, straight sprout, he handed it to
                    the little boy, with the advice, "Ride it, but be careful; he's a fractious
                    animal." "Joshie" bestrode the make-believe horse and in spite of its
                    rearing, balking and plunging, reached home happy and alert.</p>
            <p>Other reasons were apparent why Tom was ready with threats of spanking. One was that his little
                    brother would smuggle apples to bed, placing them under his pillow, then when all was silent and Tom
                    was supposed to be asleep, the champing began. The commotion was sufficient to arouse Tom and also
                    his temper.</p>
            <p>About all of his childish failings, my father talked freely, but a knowledge of his many kind and
                    unselfish acts had to be learned from others. One vivid mental picture that I formed from his
                    reminiscences has remained with me. A beloved married sister had passed away, and the boy stood at
                    the gate looking sadly after his mother as she rode away to the stricken house. In the distance, a
                    dove was calling and the plaintive notes found lodgement in the little fellow's heart. Even
                    in his last years, the cooing of a dove always <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-036-1-043"/> carried Joshua Griffith to that morning long gone by. Today,
                    more than a hundred years since the death of Aunt Mary, the notes of a dove bring to me the picture
                    of the lad alonewith his first grief.</p>
            <p>My grandfather, William J. Griffith, never lost an opportunity to encourage and patronize teachers in
                    his community. In the early twenties of the past century a school-house was built on his place. A
                    Mr. Bell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> came to take charge, bringing with him his young wife. But the lonely country with its
                    croaking frogs, hooting owls and rasping insects proved too much for the city-nurtured bride, and
                    after one term they returned to their eastern home.</p>
            <p>"Joshie" was too young to attend this school but his brothers and sisters were
                    pupils. Others attending were John, Jessie and Joshua Coleman, Hester Parkinson and the children of
                    William Lewis. "Joshie's" first teacher was a Mr. Rouse, who taught in
                    his own home on the farm, after-wards purchased for the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                        </placeName> County Infirmary</hi>. The Rouse home was about two and one-half miles south of the
                    Griffith farm. Mr. Griffith went along with his children the first day to blaze a trail.</p>
            <p>The schoolroom served a three-fold purpose, for in addition to educational activities it was used as
                    a living and bedroom. "Joshie's" favorite seat was on the foot of the
                    bed. This was not only a restful place, but by turning back the covers it provided a safe cache for
                    his apples and for the picture books which Mr. Rouse loaned him. One day during this period was
                    indelibly stamped on his memory. The teacher had told the children on the previous afternoon that
                    the next day they would see a total eclipse of the sun. "Joshie" was almost too
                    excited to sleep. While he was hastily eating breakfast, his mother said, "You need not go
                    to school today, ‘Joshie.’ " "Not go to school?"
                    "But I'll have to go to see the eclipse in Mr. Rouse's Hollow."
                    Then it was explained that the darkness would be everywhere and could be seen at home. Moreover,
                    they were afraid the eclipse might overtake him on his way to or from school.</p>
            <p>Another teacher of "Joshie's" early years was Dr. Curry, a very
                    intelligent but eccentric gentleman. One day at this school, "Joshie" became sick
                    and complained of stomachache. Dr. Curry gave him some kind words and also a sweet liquid which,
                    whatever its medicinal value, was pleasant <pb n="38" id="VAA4025-036-1-044"/> to the taste and
                    thereafter there were frequent attacks of the same malady.</p>
            <p>Later a schoolhouse was built on the Griffith farm across from the Long Run Baptist Church.
                    "Joshie" with his brothers and sisters attended school there several terms.</p>
            <p>When this building was abandoned, my grandfather gave the site on which it stood and some adjoining
                    land for a cemetery</p>
            <p>When Joshua grew older he decided to teach. With additional help from brothers and sisters he had
                    become possessed of more than ordinary education. His first examination was to be taken in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One may imagine that he felt a bit of pride as he rode along in the early morning
                    towards that city. And why not, His English was faultless, his knowledge of mathematics unusual,
                    while his penmanship—and this was true even in old age—was like copperplate
                    engraving. His general information was broad and he knew the Scriptures from cover to cover. Such an
                    array of learning from a mere youth might well surprise the examiner. So with thoughts of the fine
                    papers he would hand in, but with a nervous tremor for the new experience, he reached the office of
                    that official and was shown in. "Let me see some of your handwriting," said the
                    examiner. Father wrote his own name on a slip of paper and presented it. "License
                    granted," announced the official. Astonished, but happy, father journeyed home-ward. His
                    teaching experience covered several terms in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson Counties in the eighteen forties and early fifties.</p>
            <p>With such devout parents, it is not surprising that the young man's thoughts early turned to
                    the ministry. When about eighteen years of age, he passed an examination given by the deacons, and
                    was ordained at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>

                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>. From that time until his passing at the age of eighty-one, he was actively engaged in
                    the ministry, occupying pulpits in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson counties. He also held a few charges in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. His pastorate at Long Run Church, which his parents had helped to establish and in
                    which he received his early inspiration, lasted more than fifty years.</p>
            <p>The marriage of Joshua Griffith to Caroline M. Vernon, daughter of a prominent citizen of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName>, took place in October of 1848. Her interest in church and family life was ever a help
                    and encouragement to her husband. <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-036-1-045"/> This companionship lasted
                    fifty-six years—until his death.</p>
            <p>Usually the country churches at that time had services only once, or at most twice, monthly affording
                    the minister opportunity for serving two or more churches. In this way, my father acquired a wide
                    acquaintance since he served almost every church in Long Run Association. Nor were his activities
                    limited to Baptists. There was scarcely a family of any creed within a radius of several miles that
                    he did not at some time visit or for whom he did not perform an act of sympathy.</p>
            <p>Never was the weather too severe for him to respond to a call for his services. One New
                    Year's Day, January 1, 1864, which was referred to as the coldest in history, father was
                    expected to conduct funeral services for young David Danner (nephew of Mr. and Mrs. Sol Wright) at
                    Ghent. "Surely," mother thought, "he will not venture out
                    to-day." However, father had no other thought than to respond to the wishes of old-time
                    friends and moreover, he planned to walk as this was almost the only way to keep from freezing. The
                    trip was made, the service performed and the round trip of thirteen miles on foot brought him home
                    with frozen ears to serve as a reminder for many years.</p>
            <p>One of his long to-be remembered experiences occurred during a flood in the 1880's He had
                    been called to conduct funeral services for a child in the upper part of the county. With no thought
                    for his own comfort nor for the danger to be incurred in crossing swollen streams, he set forth in
                    the driving rain. At only one place, the old covered bridge over Indian Creek on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Moorefield pike, did he pause to question what he should do. The water was well up
                    over the floor of the bridge, which at best, owing to the age of the structure, seemed none too
                    secure. To cross was a risk; yet he made the venture successfully, went on his way and arrived at
                    his destination in good time.</p>
            <p>After the services, one of his friends invited him to spend the night at his home. Since he was
                    weary, he consented to do this, agreeing the more readily when he noticed that the rain had ceased
                    and the skies gave signs of clearing. He hoped that "against morning" not only
                    would he be rested, but also that the streams would have had time to run down. His rest, however,
                    was destined to be very short. About ten o'clock, he was aroused by a downpour of rain on
                    the roof <pb n="40" id="VAA4025-036-1-046"/> which seemed momentarily to increase in violence.
                    Convinced that if he were able to cross the bridge at all, he must do so before morning, he arose,
                    dressed hastily, and, after calling to his host that he was leaving, fared forth into the night.
                    When he reached the covered bridge and started to cross, he found that it was indeed hazardous.
                    There was no light to be seen and the drumming of the rain on the roof and swirling waters beneath,
                    through which his horse was floundering, might well have daunted a more timid soul. But again he
                    made the crossing—perhaps the last man to cross that antiquated structure—for
                    in the morning a passer-by brought word that the bridge had been floated from its bearings and was
                    so badly damaged that a new bridge was. necessary.</p>
            <p>Not all of his duties were sad ones, for many sought his services in tying the nuptial knot. The
                    marriage record in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County alone shows in the neighborhood of 1700 weddings at which he officiated. Beside
                    these there were many from adjoining counties as well as from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> who came to him to be married. There were fifty- two people named McKay for whom he
                    performed the ceremony. He was always pleased when the bride or groom, or both, were children of
                    parents whom he had married years before. In one family, he officiated for three generations.</p>
            <p>He was ambitious for his children to make a success of their lives. They were provided with the
                    necessaries, comforts and many of the luxuries. Few families had as much money to spend for books,
                    schooling and college courses. Both by example and by precept, his children were taught to respect
                    the rights and the feelings of others.</p>
            <p>His home was always a hospitable one. There were those who came bringing their troubles of this
                    world, seeking advice. One of these an elderly widow came often, seasoning her talk with such words
                    and expressions as "replevin" and "garnishee" and
                    "having the law" on certain parties. I remember father talked so calmly and
                    convincingly to her that the court was never needed to settle her difficulties. Others came seeking
                    spiritual comfort and still others were social visitors in our home. Some of these I recall while
                    others have been so vividly described to me that I seem to have known them. "Aunt"
                    Hester Winslow (the title is by courtesy) occupied an important place in <pb n="41" id="VAA4025-036-1-047"/> our family life, coming at regular intervals to help my mother. She was
                    redheaded and very Irish; yet she knew exactly what she wanted as my elder brothers and sisters soon
                    found out. Both of my parents had the greatest regard for her and although the children were wont to
                    "speed her departing" it was only to look eagerly forward to her next coming.</p>
            <p>One much welcomed guest who came often on Saturday on her way to attend Church-Meeting, was
                    "Aunt" Polly Wright, who in her youth was said to have walked every step of the
                    way with other immigrants from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> to southern Indiana. She never failed to bring something for the children if only a
                    biscuit, a pear or an apple. On one occasion she had a rare gift—a pullet with ten toes.
                    When we sold our old place in 1926, we still had an occasional ten-toed chicken.</p>
            <p>Father was very fond of music. Outside of religious music, he liked best "My Old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Home" and "Annie Laurie," but none of his daughters could
                    sing them to please him as well as could Aunt Liza (mother's sister). The Ogle family, who
                    were all musical, came at times to our home. When they were there, the afternoon was spent in music
                    at which time my father's pleasant baritone voice joined in the singing. Sometimes I used
                    to wonder why it was that he would cry over well loved music—now I think I understand.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Thiebaud (pronounced Tabo) were among other visitors to our home. Mr. Thiebaud was
                    a typical French gentleman always immaculately dressed and as I remember, never out without a cane
                    and a rose in his hand. Then there were our neighbors, so much a part of the happiness of our
                    family, Dr. and Mrs. Purdy, who were <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> intellectuals. The Doctor was our family physician, and Mrs. Purdy conducted a private
                    school which my older brothers and sisters attended The Robert Sharps were known for their
                    liberality, for their roof usually sheltered some one less fortunate than themselves. One never had
                    better neighbors. Joseph Clements and family were also neighbors of long standing. Mrs. Clements was
                    set apart from usual women in that, while she was an excellent housewife, she seldom talked about
                    domestic affairs. She was fond of reading and her conversation showed a knowledge <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-036-1-048"/> of Emerson, Swedenborgen and current literature. In a letter written in
                    her later years to my eldest sister, she said: "Your father and I have been neighbors for
                    more than sixty years and I know of no one that I would rather have for a neighbor in the great
                    Hereafter than him." This, I consider a supreme compliment.</p>
            <p>John F. Cotton and his son Perry were frequent visitors at both our town home and at "The
                    Place," as father always called the farm. The elder Cotton, I remember as a little, bent
                    man with shrewd eyes who wore a silk hat, but who addressed our revered mother as
                    "Sis" which made us feel that he was a privileged person. His son, Perry, was a
                    large, dignified man and a power in the community. Father valued the friendship of this man and his
                    son. When together, their conversation took on a political aspect, ratherheated on the part of the
                    elder Cotton, who was a Republican, and milder though no less determined on the part of my father,
                    who was a Democrat. Neither one was ever convinced, but each found the views of the other of
                    interest. All these, besides members of my father's Churches, visiting clergymen and
                    others, gave variety to the home life, and their visits were a source of delight to my father and
                    mother</p>
            <p>In speech, my father was always temperate. Simplicity marked his expressions. For example, he would
                    often say of a young man, "He is unassuming;" of some woman, "She has
                    discretion;" of another person, "He works well and is inoffensive," or,
                    "His word is good." To-day, I can recall a man, Joshua Griffith, of whom one could
                    say: "He was kind; he was intelligent; he had sound judgment; and you could trust
                    him." That man I was proud to call "Father."</p>

            <p>The work of the Indiana Historical Society is done in a large measure by committees. The Executive
                    Committee consists of the officers of the Society and five other elected members. For the year 1940,
                    it is constituted as follows: Lee Burns, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName>, treasurer, and Christopher B. Coleman, secretary). The duties of this committee, as
                    set forth in the Constitution, "shall be to meet on the days upon which the Society holds
                    its sessions or at such other times as they deem expedient; to select subjects for public lectures
                    and appoint the individuals by whom the same shall be delivered at the annual meetings of the
                    Society; to attend to the publication of such lectures and other documents as they may deem
                    expedient; to take charge of all books, papers, specimens; models, curiosities, pictures, etc.,
                    belonging to the Society, and to submit reports of their proceedings at the meetings of the
                    Society."</p>
            <p>A committee on gifts and bequests was created in 1939. The Society has in the past received several
                    bequests which were unsolicited—until the probation of the donors' wills,
                    unknown to the Society. On the other hand, of course, it has shared the universal experience of
                    benevolent and learned societies in not receiving bequests which it had been led to expect. The
                    existence of a committee on gifts and bequests, it is hoped, will increase the consideration of the
                    Society by possible benefactors and by persons making their wills. The committee on gifts and
                    bequests for 1940 consists of Emsley W. Johnson, chairman, Fred C. Gause, Joseph J. Daniels, Grier

            <head>Documents A TRIP FROM FORT WAYNE TO FORT DEARBORN IN 1809</head>
            <p>The letter and "Notes" reprinted below appeared in the Peru (Indiana) <hi rend="i">Saturday Gazette</hi> on August 10, 1839. The letter, written by J. M. D. on August 5, 1839, is
                    reproduced because of the facts that it presents relative to the traveler who made the journey in
                    1809 and because of the views characteristic of the time in which the letter was written. The
                    "Notes," were taken on the trip from <placeName>

                    "Notes," which were printed from the original, is on file in the Indiana State

                    <p>The general course of the road is something north of west. For about three miles the land is thin
                        and timbered with oak, until you reach Spy run, when immediately on crossing this stream a fine
                        bottom commences, which continues for some distance; the timber here is generally sugartree,
                        buckeye and hickory, all of a very large growth. Twelve miles further is Eel river, a tributary
                        of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                        </placeName>.’ This uncommon little stream is very deep; and at the distance of ten
                        miles on a direct line, and about seventeen by the meanderings of the stream from its source, it
                        is not more than five yards wide and is generally three feet deep, with an uncommonly slow
                        current. The land on this river is remarkably rich and appears to be well adapted to the culture
                        of wheat or hemp. There are but few situations in this region where mills could be placed, owing
                        to the levelness of the land, as all the rivers have their sources in swamps and ponds, and as
                        there are but few springs in the upper country, that is, on the high land which divides the
                        waters of the Lakes from those of the <placeName>

                        Here is one of the most enchanting prospects my eyes ever beheld. The traveller after passing
                        through a country somewhat broken for a few miles, is immediately struck with the sight of two
                        most beautiful sheets of water, as pure and limpid as the mountain spring. They are about
                        one-fourth of a mile apart. On the bank of the most westerly one I encamped for the night. The
                        borders of these Lakes are so low, that the waves often roll out upon the bushes. I perceived a
                        number of fishes playing in the lake near the shore where the water is not more than a foot
                        deep. I took my pistols, went in ten or fifteen yards and shot several ring eyed perch. Indeed
                        they were so tame that they came close to me, as if wondering at the new master that had got
                        among them. At the outlet of this lake I think there might be a mill placed. The lake I should
                        think covers about one hundred acres of land. The outlet is from the east—from thence
                        it runs about half a mile along the side of a small ridge which divides it from the other lake.
                        It then turns suddenly round to the N. E. and passes through a break in the ridge, and is merged
                        into the other, and the waters of these two beautiful likes are mingled into one. In these
                        narrows or outlets the current is very swift—and as it would be a very easy matter to
                        form a canal for a mill, it might be taken out so high as to obtain three or four feet fall. And
                        there is a sufficiency of water to drive ten run of mill stones, if it could all be brought to
                        act upon them. The soil in the vicinity of these lakes is well adapted to the cultivation of
                        wheat or any kind of small grain. The timber is chiefly white and spanish oak, with some
                        chestnut oak. The land is a mixture of sand and clay, and in some places a deep black soil
                        something like river bottom. Eighteen miles further and you come to the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
                        </placeName> river, a branch of the <placeName>
                            <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                        </placeName> of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                        </placeName>. For eight miles before you reach this river, you pass through a thicket of young
                        hickory and oaks, about as thick as a man's thumb, and growing so close together that
                        it is impossible to penetrate through it at any other place except where the road runs. This
                        land is as rich as any in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                        </placeName>, and there is not a doubt but that it would prove as fruitful if cultivated.
                        Immediately after crossing the river, which is here about fifty yards wide, a most delightful
                        prospect is presented to view—there is scarcely one tree to the acre of ground for
                        about three miles. Here is an Indian town containing about twenty houses. This village is the
                        place of residence of one of the principal chiefs of the Pottawattamies—his name is
                        Five Medals. This place is beautifully situated on the edge of a fine prairie containing about
                        three thousand acres. About a mile west of this prairie the road comes to the bank of the river,
                        where I found a spring of excellent water, a thing that is very rare in this country. Here the
                        timber is tall and thick on the ground and principally white oak. The soil is white clay.

                    <p>Ten miles down this river from the forks, is a portage of three miles west to the Theakiki

                        twenty persons kept here for the purpose of trading with the Indians. These men in the winter

                        their peltry. They all collect together in May and make up their packs, and then proceed down
                        the river into the lake and round to Michillimackinac. It will scarcely be believed that the men
                        perform a voyage of more than a thousand miles in bark canoes, heavy laden with packs, the
                        greater part of the way over a boisterous lake. The soil on the <placeName>

                        of the country. At the factory [trading post] I was told that there were the remains of a
                        British Fort three miles below, and a fine orchard of apple trees. Twenty miles from the Fort,
                        at the mouth of the river, Iwas informed a trader had raised several crops of wheat which were
                        as good as could be produced any place.</p>

                        a tree to intercept the sight for a distance of nine miles. This prairie, I was informed,

                        between marshes and prairies, which would support immense herds of cattle, at very little cost.

                        hill has been accumulating since the formation of the lake. The north west wind prevails here
                        the greater part of the year. This wind blowing over an extent of level country, not equalled in
                        the known world, acquires such force when it arrives at Lake <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                        </placeName>, that on a dry day it will raise such a cloud of sand as to completely darken the
                        air; which in time raised up a bank, and every storm has been adding to it, until the present.
                        This mountain is covered with a stunted growth of cedars and juniper trees. I presume there
                        might be as many juniper berries gathered here as would supply the <placeName>

                        will make a break in the top, the regular wind then continues to deepen the breach. The sand is
                        carried back and deposited in the valley behind the hill, which in time becomes the foundation
                        of another mountain. The traveller will see in this country hundreds of these hills [sand dunes]
                        behind the mountain, the whole body of which is carried away in some places for several hundred
                        yards, and deposited behind, and the wind is constantly in motion, taking more and more until
                        the hill will change its place. The lake of course advancing as the bank recedes, so that there
                        is no doubt but that the water has gained considerably on the land. These mountains and hills
                        are not to be found on the west side of the lake. Ten miles along the lake from the point is the
                        mouth of the river Styx, so called on account of a large Indian burying ground. Some of the
                        corpse were in troughs raised up on forks ten feet high; others were folded up in bark and laid
                        on the ground with some sticks over them. There was at the head and foot of every grave, a post
                        upon which was a number of marks thus (x x) which I was informed designated the number of
                        persons they had killed in war. A single line thus (|) was the mark of prisoners they had taken.</p>
                    <p>The road still keeps along the beach of the lake—and twelve miles further is the mouth
                        of the Grand Calumic [Calumet]. Here the sand mountain ends. Twenty miles farther is the mouth
                        of the Little Calumic [Calumet]. These two rivers are of the greatest consequence to the traders
                        on the lake. They are both about twenty yards wide <list type="footnotes">

                        longer than the other. There is a communication between these two streams, which in case of a
                        storm on the lake, the traders can run up one for several miles, and then cross over into the
                        other, and return down it again into the lake. It is twelve miles from the little Calumic to the

                        does great honor to Capt. John Whistler, who planned and built it. It is the neatest and best

                        </placeName>, there is a direct communication by water. This river Des Plain [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] which is one of the main forks of the Illinois, has its sourcenear the bank of the
                        lake. Nine miles from Fort Dearbourn it bears off to the west. At this bend there is a long pond
                        communicates with it. This pond runs about four miles eastward towards the lake, where it
                        terminates in a small creek, which flows into the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName> river. This creek is about two miles long, and in the spring of the year any kind
                        of craft may sail out of the lake into the <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                        river Des Plains, and found it to be four feet on the Lake side, and five on the other. Thus by
                        digging a canal of nine feet deep, a passage could be had at any season of the year, from the
                        falls of Niagara to the mouth of the <placeName>

                        </placeName>, without a single foot of land carriage. This canal would be about six miles long,
                        through a beautiful prairie. There is a quarry of limestone near this place, which would make
                        excellent casing for the canal.</p>

                        </placeName>, I was informed that there were several boats at the Portage which would cross the
                        next day. I accordingly went in company with Mr. Varnum and Capt. Whistler's son to the
                        portage to see them pass over. The water at this time was low, it being about the twentieth of
                        June. The boats could not pass loaded; but I had the pleasure of seeing them sail out of the
                        river Des Plains into the Pond—thence thro' the creek before mentioned into
                        the <placeName>

                        boats at the head of the <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>. There is a custom house kept at Fort Dearbourn, where all traders are obliged to
                        make an entry of their goods.</p>
                    <p>The public officers stationed here are Maj. Charles Jewitt, agent for Indian affairs; Mr. Geo. B.
                        Varnum, Factor and Commissary; Capt. John Whistler, Commandant; and Lieutenants <placeName>

                        </placeName> and Thompson. There are about sixty soldiers in this garrison, and so healthy has
                        been the place that Capt. Whistler informed me he had not lost but six men in nearly eight
                        years. And he has the same men now who built the Fort—although their time of service
                        expired, they all again enlisted—an evidence that he is a good officer and worthy of
                        his trust.</p>
                    <p>Fort Dearbourn is beautifully situated on the bank of the Lake. It is bounded on the land side by
                        an extensive <placeName>

                        appearance. <pb n="50" id="VAA4025-036-1-056"/> This lake abounds with fish of an excellent
                        quality. The White fish are caught here in great abundance. These are probably the best fresh
                        water fish in the American waters. The surge of the lake beating always against the shore,
                        frequently throws out large fish on the sand. I took up several Perch and Pickerel that would
                        weigh ten pounds—some of them alive; but the beach is frequented by flocks of crows,
                        buzzards, gulls, etc., which soon devour them as fast as they are thrown upon the shore.</p>

            <p>There was much of interest in the life of Thomas R. Marshall. A successful lawyer, as success was
                    rated in the small county seat of a rural county, he rose to be Governor of Indiana and
                    Vice-President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He was a shrewd politician, and the possessor of a rather keen wit which he loved to
                    indulge. He had ideas of his own and was quite independent, sometimes to the point where he could be
                    called stubborn. He was honest and inclined to be frank in expressing himself. He was ambitious. He
                    possessed ability, though he was not a man of broad vision. The fates were kind to him while he
                    lived and have been kind to him in regard to his biographer, if it is true that a high class
                    biographer is one who tells a straight-forward, unvarnished story.</p>
            <p>Dr. Thomas has had access to the best sources of in-formation and he has used them intelligently and
                    with fairness. He tells the story of Marshall's life simply and naturally. Three short
                    chapters cover more than fifty years. After being graduated from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College in 1873, the "Country Lawyer" was scarcely heard of outside
                    of the congressional district in which he lived, for thirty long years. In this period, he practiced
                    law and enjoyed a fair income. He made many political speeches. He did not marry until he was past
                    forty. Undoubtedly Mrs. Marshall deserves great credit for his later successes. From college days
                    until after he was married, he used intoxicants. In 1898, he even took "the cure,"
                    a step which surely helped to make his later successes possible. His biographer has learned the
                    facts and has not suppressed them, which is well. Statements that have floated around Indiana for
                    years in regard to the habits of Marshall can now be checked and forgotten.</p>
            <p>The pre-convention campaign of 1908 was so skillfully conducted that Marshall was nominated for
                    governor in the Democratic state convention of that year to the surprise of the intelligent and able
                    Thomas Taggart. For an adequate explanation of this success of Marshall, regarded as some-thing of a
                    miracle in Indiana politics, the public has waited for more than thirty years. It can now be read in
                    chapters <pb n="54" id="VAA4025-036-1-060"/> four and five of the volume under review. The story of
                    the four-year term as Governor of Indiana is not marked by dramatic events. Marshall was considered
                    a radical by Indiana's confirmed conservatives, but he was a mild liberal, to say the most,
                    who did not veer farther to the left than the middle of the road. The author portrays him truthfully
                    as an executive who stands out well among the governors of his period.</p>
            <p>The strength and independence of Marshall, coupled with the sanity and political genius of Taggart
                    and the situation that developed in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> Convention of 1912, brought about the placing of Marshall on the ticket with Woodrow
                    Wilson. Renominated with Wilson in 1916, Marshall served eight years as Vice-President. From the
                    beginning of the extremely serious illness of President Wilson in October, 1919, to March, 1921,
                    Marshall's post was a critical one. This was the most trying period of his public career,
                    and he acquitted himself well. It was not what he did but what he didn't do that revealed
                    elements of greatness in his make-up. Dr. Thomas has handled the last seventeen months of
                    Wilson's second term with skill and without bias.</p>
            <p>Marshall lived four rather uneventful years after he left the vice-presidential office, and a single
                    chapter suffices for these years. Like many other public men, he was more conservative after the
                    World War than before. Dr. Thomas says: "Marshall demonstrated a markedly growing
                    conservatism as his years advanced." If this affected his standing, it increased the
                    respect in which he was held in his home state. Much water has flowed under the bridge since the
                    death of Marshall in 1925, and he has been somewhat forgotten. Nevertheless, a reading of the
                    excellent biography which is now offered to the public will greatly interest numerous persons,
                    especially citizens of Indiana, to all of whom it is highly recommended by the reviewer.</p>

            <p>Religion was a significant phase or condition of American frontier life. Religion was ever present on
                    the frontier —at times somnolscent and yet at other times explosives <pb n="55" id="VAA4025-036-1-061"/> as for example the Great Awakening at the middle of the eighteenth
                    century and the Great Revival which began in Logan County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1797.</p>
            <p>Many eastern states feared the rise of the New West, but, while realizing that they could not stem
                    the tide of the westward march, they felt they might at least guide its course. And so too did
                    eastern churches feel about those of their flocks who formed a part of the great exodus. They felt
                    the urgent need of saving their Western brethren from too much doctrinal and ritualistic heresy. One
                    method of control or of regulation was the organization of Home Mission Societies in the East for
                    the purpose of sending missionaries into the West, and it is to this subject that Professor Colin B.
                    Goodykoontz, a student of Turner, has directed his attention in the book under review.</p>
            <p>In this scholarly and interesting book, Professor Goodykoontz has emphasized the work of
                    Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but he has by no means overlooked the home missionary work of
                    other Protestant groups. Keeping in mind the chief reason for home missions, the author states that
                    the movement was the result of many forces, namely Christian idealism, denominational rivalries,
                    humanitarian-ism, nationalism, and, not least, enlightened self-interest. The movement resulted
                    shortly after the War of 1812 in the formation of numerous societies, examples of which were the
                    American Baptist Home Mission Society, Congregational Home Mission Society, Missionary Society of
                    the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Society for the Promotion of Collegiate and Theological
                    Education in the West (S. P. C. T. E. W.)</p>
            <p>There is little question in the mind of the author but that the missionaries were generally
                    high-minded individuals whose sole effort was the advancement of Christianity, albeit particular
                    forms of it. Not infrequently, points out Goodykoontz, they were exponents of "muscular
                    Christianity." For example, Methodist Peter Cartwright with his adherents at a meeting in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> bested a crowd of "lewd and base fellows, armed with dirks, clubs, knives, and
                    horsewhips."</p>
            <p>Indiana was within the field of home missionary work. Samuel J. Mills and John D. Schermerhorn,
                    representing the Missionary Societies of <placeName>

            <p>This book is the product of an author who seems to be well pleased with the choice of his subject,
                    and who is qualified to give readers his view of one of the Congregational ministers who labored in
                    the West. Dr. Jordan has previously published source material and articles on William Salter and
                    some of his associates. He has had access to the valuable William Salter manuscript collections in
                    the preparation of his work. With commendable objectivity and in a clear and subdued style, the
                    author gives brief but significant events of Salter's career and the evolving territory and
                    state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> in which he toiled for some sixty-seven years.</p>
            <p>William Salter, student at Andover Theological Seminary, <pb n="57" id="VAA4025-036-1-063"/> accepted
                    the challenge offered by the frontier, and, under the auspices of the American Home Missionary
                    Society, entered the raw territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> in 1843 "to subdue the West to religious particularism." Tenacious of
                    his views and a born propagandist, he tried to introduce <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> ideals into a society that was saturated with indifference, intemperance, a lust for
                    land, and the spirit of expansion. Against these and all social wrongdoing, Salter struck vigorously
                    and often. Though comparatively unsuccessful, the leavening influence of his idealism was felt not
                    only in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
               </placeName>, where he spent most of his ministry, but throughout the state.</p>
            <p>Salter was not only a clergyman, but also a leader in movements for educational institutions, an
                    author, and an amateur historian. To give the reader some idea of the span of Salter's life
                    the author states: "Salter was pointed out to children as the man with whom <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> grew up." He saw soldiers recruited for the Mexican War (to him a war of
                    conquest) and for the Civil War, taking part in the latter conflict as a delegate to the field under
                    the direction of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Christian Commission. He lived through the period of the Spanish-American War and died
                    in 1910.</p>
            <p>It was difficult for the calm, unemotional religion of Congregationalism to attract as many followers
                    to its standard as did the highly emotionalized methods of the more evangelical sects. That it did
                    gain adherents in Iowa was due to the heroic efforts of Salter and men of his type. This the author
                    points out with a just respect for Congregational-ism and an equally fair treatment of the
                    accomplishments of competing denominations.</p>
            <p>With keen insight into the events and detail that go to make a biography, the author has given
                    readers interesting sketches of Salter's Andover classmates who also labored in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, as well as sidelights on modes of travel and commercial growth. Those who are
                    interested in the varied aspects of western social development will be well repaid for reading this
                    volume which portrays the work of a vigorous "Western Torchbearer."</p>

            <p>General Buckner was a man of force and character whose life was colorful. In his early manhood, he
                    spent much time in the North and married into a northern family of considerable wealth. He lived for
                    a brief period in his native <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> just before the Civil War. Nevertheless, he threw in his lot with the South and fought
                    with distinction for the Confederate cause. The people of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> being divided during the conflict, General Buckner was severely condemned by many
                    former friends. Choosing to spend the remainder of his life in the state where he was born, he was
                    one of the noted Kentuckians who worked at the task of healing the wounds left by four years of
                    bloody warfare which was indeed a brothers' war in the borderlands. In time, General
                    iuckner filled the office of Governor with honor to himself and the commonwealth—a
                    tangible demonstration that Kentuckians had solved the difficult problem of re-uniting the hosts who
                    had supported one side or the other or fought in the ranks of the <hi rend="i">Blue or the
                    Gray</hi>.</p>
            <p>The biography shows that Dr. Stickles has labored long and successfully with the excellent materials
                    that he was privileged to discover. He has treated the early life of Buckner in four short chapters,
                    and then the attempt of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to remain neutral in 1861, in which Buckner played a conspicuous part. He has hurried
                    on to the War, to which he has given about half of the volume. The long period following 1865 is
                    dealt with in about one hundred and fifty pages. The entire story is written with clearness and
                    ample details are presented. The footnotes are adequate and printed where they can be of most
                    service to readers. There is a good bibliography and a good index. The work of the publisher is very
                    well done.</p>
            <p>The portions of the book that stand out are those dealing with Fort Donelson and the imprisonment of
                    General Buckner; with his period of exile in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> from 1865 to 1867; and with his election to the governorship of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Dr. Stickles is at his best as he deals with these phases of the career of Buckner.
                    The story of the fight for and surrender of Fort Donelson has never been so well told. The long
                    period during which Unionists and Confederates had to learn to live together again in Kentucky has
                    furnished a splendid subject for the author. Whether he has made the most of his opportunity or not,
                    Dr. Stickles has certainly written a <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-036-1-065"/> good history of these
                    years. One of the most difficult problems to handle while writing the biography of Buckner was to
                    set forth the real reasons why he became a Confederate. Lee went with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Andrew Johnson refused to go with his state, and so did Buckner; but Johnson took his
                    stand with the Union, Buckner with the Confederacy. What were the springs of action in the case of
                    the "Borderland Knight"? One cannot feel that Dr. Stickles has solved this riddle.
                    Perhaps Simon Bolivar Buckner was not any too sure of himself in 1861. Possibly he just drifted into
                    the southern current. In conclusion, it must be said that anyone who does not read this life of
                    General Buckner will miss the study of a virile leader who played an interesting role in events of
                    great significance.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Hannah Courageous</hi> is the story of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> girl, Hannah Nicholson, who lived in Indiana and arrived at young womanhood not long
                    before the Civil War. It reveals the opposition of her family to slavery but also the sanity and
                    spirit of tolerance that characterized its members. Hannah's brother Samuel loved Lucy
                    Carter, a young woman who lived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and had slaves to wait on her. The tale is one that involves fugitive slaves, slave
                    hunters, and an anti-slavery schoolmaster, as well as Friends who hated slavery. The characters are
                    well drawn, the natural humanity of the families is brought out, and, in spite of the disturbing
                    influence of the slavery question, sensible adjustments are made. It is a new kind of story of the
                    days when feeling ran high between people who held conflicting views in regard to slavery, but
                    possibly a more correct interpretation of the relations between those who were drawn into the
                    controversy than were the earlier more intense and more" tragic tales. The book is from the
                    pen of Laura Long, is published by Longmans, Green and Company and sells for $2.00.</p>
            <p>Professor Hugh Evander Willis of the Indiana University School of Law has prepared a pamphlet of
                    seventy-two pages which he calls <hi rend="i">The Constitution of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> at the End of One Hundred Fifty Years</hi>. In addition to the Constitution as it
                    came from the Federal Convention, not only the regular amendments are included, but also the
                    features <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-036-1-066"/> added by constitution-making decisions of the Supreme
                    Court of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. To present the contributions of the Court to the Constitution is the real purpose of
                    the pamphlet. Professor Willis sets forth his own views of the importance of the Court as an agency
                    in making over and determining the nature of the Constitution as it really is in a twenty-page
                    "Introduction."</p>
            <p>It would seem that Congress has done a great deal to determine the actual constitution by enacting
                    laws, but Professor Willis ignores this factor. Certainly all laws required by the Constitution to
                    create the machinery of government, no matter when passed, are but amplifications of the writ-ten
                    Constitution. In addition, any act of Congress passed on the basis of a liberal interpretation of
                    the written Constitution, and not later held invalid by the Supreme Court, adds something to the
                    organic law. Further, the government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is operated by political parties and all of that vast portion of the unwritten
                    constitution which is due to the growth and work of parties is as truly a part of the real
                    constitution as what has been added by the Court. The pamphlet of Professor Willis indicates a move
                    in the right direction, but why not include as well other significant features that have been
                    engrafted on the written document? The last paragraph of the "Introduction" to
                    this pamphlet is very interesting, but not every serious minded student of the government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> will subscribe to the extreme eulogism of the Supreme Court there to be found. It is
                    possible to present very strong arguments against the principal assertions contained in this
                    paragraph.</p>
            <p>The pamphlet is a publication of Indiana University, Social Science Series, No. 1. It is for sale by
                    the Indiana University Book Store at seventy-five cents per copy.</p>

            <head>Editor's Pages INDIANA A HUNDRED YEARS AGO</head>
            <byline>WILLIAM O. LYNCH</byline>
            <p>By the calendar, only one hundred years have passed since 1840, but, in material civilization, there
                    have been more changes in the last century than in any previous span of a thousand years. True, the
                    industrial revolution passed through its first stages in the century preceding 1840, but it has
                    spread over civilized countries outside of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> mainly since that date. Certainly Indiana was a crude, young state a hundred years ago.
                    The total population was then 685,866. The largest city in the state was <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with 4,266 inhabitants. There were three other cities with a population above 2,000: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with 3,798; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with 2,692; and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with 2,070.</p>
            <p>There were eighty-seven counties in Indiana in 1840. So rapidly had these local units been set up,
                    that there were but five of the present number yet to be established. Only <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> County had over 20,000 people, 23,290, to be exact. Twenty-five counties had from
                    10,000 to 20,000, forty-nine from 2,000 to 10,000, and twelve under 2,000. The twelve, some of which
                    have since been divided, were: <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>, <settlement type="city">DeKalb</settlement>, <region type="county">Fulton</region>, <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>, <region type="county">Jasper</region>
               </placeName>,
                    Lake, Marshall, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pulaski</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Stark, Wells, White, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Whitley</region>
                    </placeName>. All of the counties in this list were in the northern part of the state, save <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>. The public lands offices were still active, as there were several millions of acres of
                    government land yet to be sold in Indiana. In the year 1836, the banner year of the boom that
                    collapsed in 1837, more than four millions of acres of the public lands within the state were sold.
                    This means that about one fifth of the land in Indiana was reduced to private ownership for the
                    first time in the history of the world in a single year.</p>
            <p>The depression that followed in the wake of the panic of 1837 reached its worst in 1840 and 1841.
                    Prices were low, mortgage foreclosures were common, men were out of work, and the state government
                    could not sell bonds to obtain funds for the completion of the program of constructing public works
                    that had been authorized by the Internal Improvements measure of 1836 which was called the
                    "Mammoth Bill".</p>
            <pb n="62" id="VAA4025-036-1-068"/>
            <p>The former governor of Indiana Territory, General William Henry Harrison, who now lived at North
                    Bend, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, was the candidate of the new Whig Party for the presidency. President Martin VanBuren
                    was the Democratic standard bearer. The enthusiastic Whigs, sung, shouted, and paraded their way to
                    victory, not only in Indiana but in the nation as well. They presented no program during the
                    spectacular and hilarious contest, but they did promise to bring prosperity to the public. The boom
                    that followed the War of 1812 collapsed in 1819. It was followed by a depression, and that, in turn,
                    by a slow and rather lean decade. From 1833 to 1836, the business tempo increased with surprising
                    speed. Banks multiplied, colonists flowed westward in enlarging numbers, speculation became rife,
                    and credit was extended to unheard of proportions. Business men believed that they had found a sure
                    and permanent basis for acquiring fortunes. After the collapse, there was a wide-spread belief that
                    the return of prosperitcy would come with the restoration of the "credit system."
                    Whigs and their backers among the business elements had no love for hard-money men or for the
                    Independent Treasury system, which was the offering of the VanBuren Administration in 1840.</p>
            <p>A century ago, there was hardship, want and misery in a land of plenty. The phenomenon of starvation
                    in the midst of abundance is not so new. That the problem of how to guard against recurring crises
                    is not easy of solution is very evident. In 1840, the method of proceedure was very simple. The
                    general belief was that good times would re-turn eventually. As a result of their sweeping victory
                    in 1840, Whigs obtained a control in both branches of Congress. Then, the party leaders revealed
                    that their policy was to abolish the new Independent Treasury system and restore the Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. After this, prosperity would quickly return. The repeal of the Treasury Act of 1840
                    was easy, but John Tyler blocked the enactment of a Bank measure. Neither in 1841 nor later were the
                    Whigs able to establish a new Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, consequently they never learned what might have come had they succeeded in carrying
                    out their "healing policy."</p>
            <p>In 1840, the crude machinery of finance and business management had stalled on the road, but thanks
                    to the resources of the country and the unquenchable belief in the future <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-036-1-069"/> that possessed the people, the obstacles to progress were overcome
                    under a laissez faire regime. A hundred years later, the far more complex machinery of business and
                    finance has failed to measure up to the needs of the time. Government activity has been greatly
                    extended. Many pressing problems remain to be solved. The question of the hour is: "Shall
                    business interests be given a free hand once more, or shall the people through their government have
                    to assert a much more complete control of production and distribution?" The people of
                    Indiana, no more than the people of the country as a whole, are ready to answer this question. A
                    study of conditions in 1840 and of the history of the century that has ensued ought to help
                    Americans to work out the problem. Surely the experiences of a hundred years should have taught some
                    lessons.</p>

            <byline>AUGUSTUS R. MARKLE</byline>
            <p>In writing of any man, there is always much left out of the story, whether genealogy or biography is
                    the object, for in a biography we necessarily must take ancestry into account, and in genealogy the
                    mere parading across the page of a lot of names fails to bring into the picture the effect that
                    ancestors had in producing the man. There is not room in this department of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> to set out many of the features of his life nor to do more than name those
                    forebears who had a part in determining the life and character of the man who became the first
                    president of the Society of Indiana Pioneers, John Hampden Holliday.</p>
            <p>Mr. Holliday was educated in the public schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and, after four years at the Northwestern Christian University, the predecessor of <placeName>

                    </placeName> College, he entered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College where he was graduated in the Class of 1864. A little before his graduation, he
                    enlisted in the One Hundred Thirty-seventh Indiana, a hundred-day regiment, and served for four
                    months. He then re-enlisted in the Seventieth Indiana Infantry for three years, but was rejected by
                    the medical examiner. After a short experience in the practice of law, he began work with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>He retired from the <hi rend="i">News</hi> in 1892 and a year later helped organize the Union Trust
                    Company, of which he became the first president. He resigned in 1899 to found the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Press which had a short life, being sold a year and a half later to the <hi rend="i">News</hi>. Mr. Holliday then became president of the Union Trust Company again. In 1916, he
                    became Chairman of the Board of Directors and was for many years connected with other financial and
                    benevolent institutions of <placeName>

                    1920, Mr. Holliday announced the gift of $25,000 to the Emmerich Manual Training High
                    School in memory of his son, John Hampden Holliday, Jr., who was a graduate of this High School in
                    the Class of 1901. On December 23, 1917, the young man died while in army service at <placeName>

                    Crow's Nest on <geogName>White River</geogName>, that John Hampden Holliday died, at the

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to the Reverend William Adair Holliday and his wife Lucia Shaw Cruft, John H. Holliday
                    was the product of two widely dissimilar stocks. His father, the son of Samuel Holliday, was born in

                  <region type="county">Harrison County</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, a few years before the removal of the family to Indiana in
                    1816. His mother was born in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1805 and died in 1881.</p>
            <p>The grandfather, Samuel Holliday, was born in 1779 to William Holliday and Martha Patton. Of the
                    latter very little is known, but we know that William was born in Ire-land in 1755 and died in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1812. His parents were Samuel Holliday, born in 1709, and Janet Adair. Samuel
                    Holliday, the grandfather of John Hampden Holliday, married Elizabeth Martin (1781-1846). She was
                    the daughter of Jacob Martin, a soldier in the Revolutionary War and his wife, Catherine Wilson.</p>
            <p>In so far as a man is what his mother makes him, the New <placeName>

                    </placeName> ancestry of John Hampden Holliday had much to do with his life in later years, and it
                    is of this side of his family that the most is known.</p>
            <p>The mother of John H. Holliday was Lucia Shaw Cruft <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-036-1-074"/> (1805-1881).
                    Lucy was the daughter of John Cruft, who was born in <placeName>

            <p>John, the father of Ann Breck, was the son of a John Breck (1680-1713) who was married in 1703 to Ann

                    mentioned above, and many others of her family, leaving most valuable records. In her notes, she
                    states that the Jane Collins, who married John McCoy on Oct. 13, 1803, was a sister of William E.
                    Collins, and that his daughter Jane married John Biggs as shown in the Coleman record. The parentage
                    of William and Jane Collins is not given, nor the name of the wife of William E. Collins. Eliza
                    McCoy, born April 1, 1813, was the seventh child of John and Jane (Collins) McCoy. She died on Nov.
                    8, 1891, and the account of her life as given in the <hi rend="i">Memoir</hi> tells of her work as a
                    missionary to the Indians, from June 17, 1844, to 1853; her educational work, and financial aid to

                        places occupied by the family of Elijah and Anne E. (Calton) Hanly, parents of Governor Hanly.
                        It required much time and money to locate exactly the sites of these two homes. Each was a log
                        cabin in the woods. After the sites were located in the fields of today, it was possible to find
                        pieces of brick from the chimney, some charcoal, and pieces of dishes, old milk crocks and jugs.</item>
