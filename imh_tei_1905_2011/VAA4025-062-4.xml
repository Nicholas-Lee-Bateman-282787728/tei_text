                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1883) is a valuable and often used source concerning Indiana history from territorial
                    days through the 1870's. Most of its sketches are biographical, but they include much
                    commentary about political, economic, and cultural life. As indicated in the Preface, "no
                    inconsiderable part" of the book was "derived from the author's own
                    observation and recollection, and would pass away with him were it not committed to
                    writing." One of the most interesting of Woollen's sketches is that on "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> from 1844 to 1852." The author had been a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in these years.</p>
            <p>Madison was Indiana's leading city at the middle of the nineteenth century.
                    Woollen's portrait describes its public buildings, churches, newspapers, lawyers,
                    politicians, trade, and manufacturing plants in the city's heyday. Etched in this portrait
                    are revealing comments about fugitive slaves, antislavery sentiment, treatment of the insane, the
                    Mexican War, graded streets and paved sidewalks, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and the like. Woollen's picture is incomplete concerning such items as the
                    significance to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    </placeName>'s primacy as a Hoosier railroad center. Perhaps these items were too obvious
                    to his audience and readers to require emphasis. Woollen, however, perceptively recognized that
                    Madison's decline, at least relative to other Indiana cities, was well advanced by the late
                    1870's.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1844. In October of that year I landed, one evening, at the city wharf, and put up
                    for the night at a hostelry known as the Light House. It stood on the east side of Mulberry street
                    extended, between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> street and low-water mark. It was a two-story brick and frame house of the ordinary
                    style, and was the only building then in the city between <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> street and the river, and it was the only one that ever stood within these bounds since
                    I have known the city. It long since passed away, but its location and its appearance are indelibly
                    written upon my memory.</p>
            <p>At this time Madison was a well built city of 4000 or 5000 souls. Its streets were graded and its
                    sidewalks paved much as they are to-day. The exception I now remember is High street, which then,
                    east of Main street, was neither graded nor graveled. The principal hotels in the city at that time
                    were the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> House. The former stood on the site of the Academy of Our Lady of the Angels, and was
                    kept by George D. Fitzhugh, now of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the latter, which was under the direction of Enoch D. Withers, still stands as a
                    monument of hotel architecture of the olden time. The Court-house was a two-story brick building of
                    modest pretensions, standing on the site of the present one. Southeast of the Court-house was the
                    jail, an old, dingy building two stories high, fronting on an alley, with cells in either story, and
                    rooms for the <list type="footnotes">

                    lot was the Clerk's office, a squatty one-story brick house of two rooms, fronting on Main
                    Cross street. At the northwest corner of the lot, on the corner of Main Cross and Main streets,
                    stood a two-story building, having two rooms in the first story, and three in the second, with a
                    platform on a level with the latter running the entire length from east to west. The platform was
                    reached from both Main Cross and Main streets by wooden stairways, over which people passed to reach
                    the offices above. The main room below was occupied by Bramwell &amp; Phillips as a dry goods
                    store, and the other was the office of Dr. Joseph H. D. Rogers whose presence is not yet denied you.
                    The west room above was the Recorder's office, the center one the Auditor's
                    office, and the east one the office of the County Treasurer. Around the Court-house lot was a brick
                    wall four feet high, capped with stone. Such were the public buildings of <placeName>

                    </placeName> This prelate was succeeded by Father Dupontavice, who was known to you all. The Rev.
                    Harvey Curtis was pastor of the Second Presbyterian church, the Rev. Mr. Leavenworth of the First
                    Presbyterian church, and the Rev. E. D. Owen of the Baptist church on Vine street. The policy of the
                    Methodist church is such that its clergy remain but a short time in charge of a particular
                    congregation, but I remember the Rev. W. C. Smith and the Rev. Prescott as pastors of Wesley Chapel,
                    and the Rev. John Keiger and the Rev. Dr. Daily as pastors of Third street church. Saint
                    John's church was not then in existence. This church was an offshoot from Wesley Chapel.
                    Among its leading members were the Taylors—Gamaliel, John H. and William
                    M.—Caleb Schmidlapp and Charles W. Basnett. The church building was erected in 1849 or
                    1850, near the site of the first Methodist church built in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Rev. John S. Bayliss was the first pastor of Saint John's.</p>
            <p>Christ Episcopal church and the United Presbyterian church <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-062-4-010"/> were
                    erected during this time. The former was built mainly by the exertions of Joseph M. Moore, then
                    cashier of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch Bank, and of its worthy rector, the Rev. Dr. Claxton. Dr. Claxton was a
                    gentleman of acknowledged ability and was esteemed outside his parish as well as within it. He was,
                    probably, the most popular minister in the city of his day. The Reverend James Browne, pastor of the
                    United Presbyterian church, was a man of earnest convictions and of deep piety. He was an active
                    worker in the anti-slavery cause, and did much to create public sentiment among us in opposition to
                    human slavery. He used to declaim against this abomination from the pulpit, and was ever ready to
                    espouse the cause of the oppressed. It is to the labors of such men as Mr. Browne that the world is
                    indebted for that public sentiment which eventually strangled this monster in his lair.</p>

            <p>At this time there were two weekly newspapers published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the <hi rend="i">Banner</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Courier.</hi> The first was edited
                    by Daniel D. Jones, known as Davy Jones, and the latter by Rolla Doolittle. Mr. Jones was a clapper
                    little gentleman, a Welshman by birth, and in his day the foremost newspaper writer in the State.
                    His sentences were short and terse, and their meaning always apparent. He seldom wrote his
                    editorials; he set them at the case and composed them as he handled the types. He was a genial,
                    social man, delighting in fun and practical jokes. I was once at a social party at his house when a
                    most ludicrous incident occurred. He kissed a young lady, who turned upon him as if to box his ears.
                    His wife, a large, portly woman, was present, and to her Mr. Jones ran for protection. She was
                    seated, and he cuddled by her side, sitting on the floor with his head under her arm, and looking
                    into her face, his eyes sparkling with merriment, he said: "Mother, protect your
                    boy." I need say nothing of Mr. Doolittle, the editor of the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi>, as
                    he is of and with you at the present time.</p>

                    Jones's death, in 1851, his late interest in the paper was purchased by the Hon. John R.
                        <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-062-4-011"/> Cravens, who, in March, 1851, sold it to William Wesley
                    Woollen. Subsequent to this time Mr. Woollen bought Mr. Crail's interest, and in 1853 sold
                    the <hi rend="i">Banner</hi> to General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Stapp, who soon afterwards disposed of it to Captain W. H. Keyt, in whose hands it
                    died.</p>
            <p>Samuel F. and John I. Covington bought the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> in 1848, or thereabout, and
                    changed it to a daily. In 1849 they sold it to Mr. M. C. Garber, now its senior proprietor. Mr.
                    Garber is the ranking newspaper publisher in the State, having been continuously engaged in the
                    business for twenty-nine years and over.</p>

            <p>In 1852 the <hi rend="i">Daily Madisonian</hi> was established by a company of Democratic
                    politicians. Rolla Doolittle was its publisher, and Robert S. Sproule its editor. It lived during
                    the Scott and Pierce campaign, and soon thereafter it yielded up the ghost.</p>
            <p>A daily paper was published a week or so during this time by B. F. Foster and Ben. F. Reed, but its
                    life was too short for it to be properly classed among the journals of <placeName>

                    younger, who gathered in the Senate chamber the laurels which would have been his had he continued
                    at the bar. The two William Hendrickses, senior and junior, were of it—the elder an
                    ex-Governor and an ex-Senator; the younger genial in disposition and with a heart ever responsive to
                    distress: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    Hull, and Thom, and Crittenden, and Walker, and Shaw, and perhaps others whom I have forgotten. One
                    whom I have not named I first knew as a wagon-maker in the neighboring town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>. One-half the day he worked at his bench; the other half and well into the night he
                    studied law. Weekly, under the summer's sun and through the winter's snow, he
                    walked to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to recite his lessons, for he was too poor to pay for riding. In due time he stood his
                    examination and was admitted to the bar. He came here and opened an office, but clients came not.
                    Weekly board bills were to pay, clothing had to be bought, and other necessary expenses to be met,
                    and how to do these things was the problem this courageous young man was to solve. More than once he
                    consulted with me in regard to abandoning his profession and returning to his trade. I advised
                    against it, and the advice was followed. After awhile "the tide which, taken at its flood,
                    leads on to fortune," turned. He was elected City Attorney, then County Attorney, then a
                    Senator, and now he is the honored Judge of your Circuit Court.<hi rend="sup">∗</hi>

            <p>In this connection it is proper that I should say something of the Judges before whom these men

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> the Circuit Judge was Miles C. Eggleston. He was then in feeble health and well
                    stricken in years. He was small in stature, a good lawyer, and although at times cross and petulant,
                    he never forgot the dignity of his station.</p>
            <p>Courtlancl dishing succeeded Judge Eggleston upon the bench. He had respectable talents, was very
                    dressy and quite a beau among the ladies. While serving as judge he was appointed Chargé

            <p>Alexander C. Downey, now, as then, a resident of Rising Sun, followed Judge Cushing as presiding
                    judge of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Circuit. Judge Downey is, or was at this time, an inveterate wag. I will relate two
                    incidents which will show the truth of this:</p>
            <p>In these days full beards were unknown, and a moustache was as rare as a disinterested friend. The
                    Rev. Frederick T. Brown once apologized from his pulpit for wearing a full beard, and no other
                    public man of the day had the temerity to offend in a similar manner. A young man noted as a wit,
                    and who, since that time, has attracted much attention by reason of a rencounter which resulted in
                    death, removed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> at this time. He had a red moustache which he cultured with the greatest care. He was
                    often in the Court-house, and one day while he was there Judge Downey wrote the following order and
                    handed it to the clerk:</p>
            <p>"Ordered by the court, that the young man with the red moustache be taken into the custody
                    of the sheriff and by him conducted to the nearest barber shop and there shaved within an inch of
                    his life; and may the Lord have mercy on his soul."</p>
            <p>On another occasion, when the term of the court was nearly ended and order was lax, Abram W.
                    Hendricks and John S. Hillis lay down at full length within the bar of the court-room. Observing
                    their posture, Judge Downey wrote the following order and passed it to the clerk:</p>
            <p>"Ordered by the court, that Abram W. Hendricks and John S. Hillis, two members of this bar,
                    be, and each of them hereby is, fined five dollars for contempt of court for lying at full length
                    within the bar during the sitting of the court." And on a line below the order, and in
                    brackets, he added: "Which may be satisfied by bringing into court, at once, twelve good,
                    ripe watermelons." The dozen watermelons were soon in the Temple of Justice and the wrath
                    of the Judge appeased.</p>

            <p>At this time William Hendricks, junior, was the Judge of the Jefferson Probate Court. This court was
                    one of limited jurisdiction, <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-062-4-015"/> its business being to settle the
                    estates of deceased persons, and to care for their minor children. Judge Hendricks was one of the
                    kindest men I ever knew. Of a genial nature, he had the esteem and love of all who knew him. I never
                    heard him say an unkind word of any one, nor any one say an unkind word of him. He was one of those
                    rare men whose province is to make happy every one they meet. I can recall the memory of no one with
                    more pleasure than that of this good and modest man. In the language applied to another by one of
                    the most gifted daughters of Indiana, "He was good enough to be a woman."</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, succeeded Judge Hendricks. He was a man of marked character. He was a soldier of the
                    war of 1812, and had served the State in many important positions. He was of unquestioned courage,
                    and although an elder of the Presbyterian church, he never pleaded his religion in bar for not
                    resenting an insult. In the year 1848 a meeting was held in the Court-house to put forward General
                    Taylor for the presidency. It was the first meeting for that purpose held in the country, and as it
                    was mainly inspired by Judge Dunn, it will be seen that he was the author of the movement that
                    culminated in the election of old "Rough and Ready" to the presidency. The Judge
                    offered a resolution nominating General Taylor and supported it in an earnest speech. Charles
                    Woodward submitted an amendment, putting forward Tom Corwin, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, for Vice-President. This Judge Dunn opposed. He said that its adoption would militate
                    against the interests of General Taylor. It will be remembered that Governor Corwin opposed the
                    Mexican war. In a speech delivered in the Senate of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, he said:</p>
            <p>"If I were a Mexican I would tell you, ‘Have you not room in your own country to
                    bury your dead men? If you come into mine we will greet you with bloody hands, and welcome you to
                    hospitable graves.’"</p>
            <p>Referring to this speech Judge Dunn said that while he could cordially support its author for
                    Vice-President, many friends of General Taylor would be driven from him if his name were <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-062-4-016"/> coupled with that of the man who had uttered such a sentiment. Mr.
                    Woodward replied to him with some warmth, and during his speech said': "The
                    gentleman admits that the nomination of Governor Corwin would be a good one, but says he is afraid
                    to have it made." Slapping his breast with his hand as was his custom when speaking
                    earnestly, he exclaimed, "Cowardice, sir, cowardice." Judge Dunn sprang to his
                    feet, and approaching Mr. Woodward, said in a loud voice: "I am an old man, and never
                    before was cowardice imputed to me. I ask the-gentleman to take back his words. Will he do
                    it?" Whether it was the sight of the judge's fist, or whether it was a sense of
                    justice that caused Mr. Woodward to withdraw the offensive words, I know not, but I remember they
                    were withdrawn.</p>

                    <hi rend="sc">JUDGES</hi>.</p>
            <p>Previous to the adoption of the present constitution each county had two associate judges. These
                    officials, usually denominated side judges, sat on either side of the presiding judge, and acted as
                    guy-ropes to hold him level. As a rule they were neither Blackstones nor Mansfields, but were
                    possessed of good common sense, an important requisite of the righteous judge. William M. Taylor and
                    Robert Kinnear were the associate judges in Jefferson, and they were the last of their line. They
                    went out of office with the old constitution, but their deeds live after them. Judge Taylor was a
                    low, chunky man with a kindly face, was a saddler by trade and a gentleman by nature. He dressed
                    neatly, wore a fob-chain with a large seal dangling at his side, and walked with a cane. Judge
                    Kinnear was a farmer, and lived near Bryantsburgh. He was a large man with stooped shoulders and an
                    ungainly walk. These judges sometimes, though rarely, held court in the absence of the presiding
                    judge. When they did so the lawyers would call up their cases which had no merit and have them
                    decided. I remember one case which was tried in the absence of Judge Cushing that caused much
                    merriment at the time. It grew out of a horse trade, and Mr. Michael G. Bright was the defendant,
                    and acted as his own attorney. It was of that class of suits which, under the old practice, was
                    brought when the plaintiff was not the party in interest. Mr. Bright called the case, and, as
                    attorney for the <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-062-4-017"/> plaintiff, ordered it dismissed. "Not
                    so fast, Mr. Bright," said Mr. Marshall, rising to his feet. "I have something to
                    say about that." He proceeded to state the case, and succeeded in satisfying the court that
                    it should not be dismissed. The trial proceeded, and Mr. Bright made an ingenious speech in which he
                    quoted much law, and when he sat down it seemed certain that his case was won. Mr. Marshall arose,
                    and with unusual deliberation addressed the court. He said that as the case was a small
                    one—the amount involved being but sixty dollars—he had given it but little
                    thought; that Mr. Bright knew the law, and as he was attorney for the plaintiff, attorney for the
                    defendant, and defendant, himself, he had no doubt thoroughly familiarized himself with the case;
                    that, if what he had laid down to the court as law was the law, he was entitled to a finding in his
                    favor; therefore, he moved the court that Mr. Bright be put upon his oath, and required to answer as
                    to whether or not the law he had given the court was the law of the land. Turning to Mr. Bright, and
                    pointing at him with his finger, he exclaimed: "Will you swear, Mr. Bright, will you swear,
                    sir?" The effect was electrical. Mr. Bright would not swear, and Mr. Marshall won the case.</p>

            <p>The County Commissioners in these days were Nathan Robinson, John E. Gale, John Kirk, John Smock and
                    James W. Hinds. It was during the administration of the first three of these gentlemen that the
                    present jail and jailer's residence were built. Before undertaking a work requiring so
                    large an outlay of money they concluded to go on a tour of observation and examine the best models
                    of such buildings they could find. Accordingly, accompanied by their architect, Monroe W. Lee, they
                    went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> to inspect the prisons of that State. They journeyed in a stage-coach—for in
                    those days railroads were not so common as they are to-day—and one afternoon during the
                    trip they had for a fellow-passenger a loquacious gentleman who made himself exceedingly agreeable
                    to "the innocents abroad." When night drew her curtains over the earth and the
                    bright eyes of the stranger could no longer light the stage-coach, the honorable gentlemen from
                    Jefferson went to sleep. They <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-062-4-018"/> could not retire to the arms of
                    Morpheus, for there was no couch to repose upon, so they contented themselves with sitting still and
                    doing homage to the sleepy god by reverentially bowing their heads. "Some wee short hour

                    clutch of the stranger awoke the Captain and brought him to his senses. He angrily demanded the
                    cause of the assault. "Pardon me, sir," replied the stranger, "I thought

            <p>John II. Taylor was Clerk of the courts during the time of which I speak. He was a small mah, of
                    light complexion, affable in manner and a fluent talker. Dr. Tefft, at that time editor of the <hi rend="i">Ladies' Repository</hi>, declared, in an article published in his magazine,
                    that Mr. Taylor's house was the home of the prophets—referring to the fact that
                    it was the uniform stopping-place of the Methodist clergy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Taylor was a great lover of tobacco. He chewed it constantly when not asleep, and was never seen,
                    in-doors or outdoors, at home or abroad, without his cheek being distended by an enormous quid of
                    the narcotic plant. About this time Daguerrean artists first appeared in the West, and one of them

                    succeeded in securing a good likeness of himself, and took it home to show it to his family. Handing
                    it to his wife he asked her how she liked it. "Better than the original," replied
                    the good dame; "the tobacco is there but not the spittle."</p>

                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName> during this time were William H. Phillips, Robert Right Rea, Henry Deputy, and Robert
                    M. Smith. Mr. Phillips still lives among you, so it is unnecessary to speak of him, but I can not
                    pass Messrs. Rea and Deputy without notice. They were both men of marked peculiarities of character
                    and took active parts in the public affairs of their <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-062-4-019"/> day. Mr.
                    Rea was a well built man of ordinary size, with a bald head and kindly face. He was unlettered but
                    was unusually shrewd and cunning. He was a natural detective and a terror to absconding thieves and
                    runaway cows. He was also feared by runaway slaves, for many a panting fugitive was arrested by him
                    and returned to bondage. I never could satisfactorily account for this trait in his character, for
                    he had a kind heart and was no slave to Mammon. It probably was the effect of his early education.
                    Mr. Rea was easily teased and had no relish for a practical joke when he was the subject. Cool
                    White, a negro minstrel, once offered a gold pen as a prize for the best conundrum. The offer
                    brought a large audience to the entertainment, and among others present was Mr. Rea. When the
                    exercises were ended White announced that the prize had been awarded to Captain Horace Hull for the
                    following conundrum: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"Why is our sheriff like old Uncle Ned?</p>
                        <p>Because he has no hair on the top of his head."</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>Captain Hull walked to the platform amid shouts of laughter and cries of "bravo,"
                    to receive the prize. He returned with it down the aisle to where Mr. Rea was seated, and bowing,
                    offered it to him. "Which, which," said the sheriff: "damn it,
                    which?" Captain Hull kept the prize.</p>
            <p>Henry Deputy was a large man, of dark complexion and with black hair and beard. He was affected in
                    his voice and manners and very particular in his dress. He wore shirts with ruffled fronts and was
                    seldom on the street with hands ungloved. He was long in the service of Sheriff Rea, first as clerk
                    and barkeeper in the old hotel that stood on the south side of the public square, and afterwards as
                    deputy sheriff. The late Dr. Cross used to tell a good story on Mr. Deputy. He said he was in the
                    hotel one day when a Kentuckian entered, and addressing Mr. Deputy, said: "How is it that
                    every time I come here Right Rea has a new barkeeper. What is your name, sir?" "My
                    name, sar, is Deputy, sar." "Then, Mr. Deputy, sar, will you please, sar, hand me
                    a cigar? " "With pleasure, sar," and he handed the Kentuckian a cigar,
                    accompanied with a lighted match. "I tell the tale as it was told to me," and with
                        <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-062-4-020"/> out vouching for its truth, but it is entirely consistent
                    with Mr. Deputy's character and manners. If there was a Beau Brummell in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was he, and if he was not a Chesterfield it was for the want of ability rather than
                    desire. While he was deputy sheriff he was the keeper of the jail and lived in the front rooms of
                    the jail building. One night the prisoners made an effort to escape, and had almost succeeded before
                    they were discovered. When Mr. Deputy reached the cell door and found them engaged in picking the
                    wall, he called out in his blandest tones: "Gentlemen, gentlemen, desist from your
                    operations, or I shall be under the disagreeable necessity of putting handcuffs upon you."
                    The "gentlemen" desisted, but whether it was the polite and persuasive manner of
                    the officer or the fear of handcuffs that stayed their hands, is not written in the chronicles of
                    these days. Poor, Deputy! He afterwards became penniless, but his pride did not forsake him. I
                    remember that on a cold day, several years after the time of which I am speaking, he came to me in
                    the Court-house and asked for money to buy a load of wood. His clothes were seedy and threadbare,
                    and as he sat in a chair before the fire, he drew the tail of his well worn overcoat over his knees
                    to hide the rents in his clothing. It was the ruling passion, strong in death.</p>

            <p>At this time Joseph B. Stewart was a student in the law office of Marshall &amp; Glass. He was
                    six feet tall or over, and of gigantic frame; vain and pompous. He was loud of speech, and ever
                    ready to talk in public. On the breaking out of the Mexican war a meeting was held in the
                    Court-house to stimulate enlistments. It was addressed by General <placeName>

                    </placeName> Stapp and John Lyle King, and perhaps by others. Stewart was present, but was not
                    called upon for a speech. After the meeting adjourned and the crowd were leaving the Court-house
                    there were loud calls for Stewart. He mounted the wall which surrounded the public square and
                    commenced to harangue the people. He eloquently descanted upon the glory to be won at the
                    cannon's mouth and upon the beauty of the halls of Montezuma. He closed his speech about as
                    follows: "Business prevents me, my fellow citizens, from drawing my sword in this glorious
                        <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-062-4-021"/> cause. I would gladly unsheath it in my country's
                    defense, but duty to others forbids. But there are some things I can and will do. Those of you who
                    go to war and die in the service will not be forgotten by me. I will assist in settling your estates
                    on the most reasonable terms. I will advise your widows of their legal rights, and see that your
                    orphans are not defrauded of their patrimonies. These things I will do at a considerable reduction
                    on regular rates for such services." Stewart is now, and for many years has been, one of
                    the most noted and successful of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>

                    and, unaided, marched them to jail. On one occasion he had a difference with a prominent citizen
                    which led to angry words. He pronounced the man a liar and a scoundrel to his face. The prominent
                    citizen retorted: "You dare not repeat those words." General Stapp went to the
                    door of the office he was in and called to several gentlemen who were near. In their presence he
                    said: "I have called you gentlemen to witness that I here pronounce Mr.—a liar
                    and a scoundrel." The insult was not resented. General Stapp was president of the
                    convention held at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1849, that nominated William McKee Dunn for Congress. I well remember the speech he
                    made on taking the chair. He complained of his neglect by the Whig <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-062-4-022"/> party, and declared himself entitled to more consideration than he had
                    received. He said he had recently returned from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he went to get an office from General Taylor, but his application was refused. He
                    declared that he experienced great difficulty in getting an interview with Mr. Clayton, the
                    Secretary of State, while others who had done nothing for the parly were admitted without trouble.
                    Continuing in this strain for awhile, he said: "When I first met Mr. Clayton, he inquired
                    who I was. I told him I was General Stapp, of Indiana. He said he had never heard of me before.
                    ‘What, sir,’ said I, ‘never heard of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Stapp, and you the Secretary of State of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>?’" The General had supposed his fame was national, not provincial.</p>

            <p>Three noted men in these days were McKinley, Newberry and Murray. They were demented but harmless.
                    McKinley believed he owned the major part of the city. His possessions also included lands in
                    foreign countries, and sometimes he thought himself the governing power of at least one European
                    monarchy. At times he would saw a load of wood, or perform other manual labor, but usually he was
                    upon the street discoursing upon his riches. Sometimes he would disappear and be gone for awhile,
                    but he would soon return and repeat "his thrice told tale." He was about as well
                    known at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and I have seen him more than once in that city and at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> with a crowd about him listening to his wondrous stories. He once became very angry
                    with me because I told him that he and Murray (who also claimed to own the city) should settle the
                    question of title before he disposed of some property he was trying to sell. He said Murray was
                    "nothing but a damned old Yankee, and had no sense no how."</p>
            <p>Newberry was a very different man. He approached you as stealthily as a cat, and would be bending
                    over you and whispering in your ear before you were aware of his presence. He talked in a low voice,
                    and his words were generally incoherent and sometimes meaningless. He always had a short gun
                    strapped to his back, and his appearance was anything but inviting. He harmed no one, but the wonder
                    is that he did not. His whispered <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-062-4-023"/> words, his wild look and the
                    gun upon his back always inspired me with terror, and made me watch him like a hawk. In his young
                    days he was a prosperous man of business, and he became insane by trying to solve an impossible
                    problem.</p>
            <p>Murray was the worst man of the three, if not the greatest lunatic. He was given to liquor, and was
                    terribly abusive when in his cups. At such times he would walk the streets, and "swear like
                    the army in Flanders." He was particularly abusive of Moody Park, the Mayor of the city,
                    who had often sent him to jail for drunkenness. He believed he was owner of all the property in the
                    city by virtue of a judgment he had recovered for one million of dollars for false imprisonment.
                    This hallucination ever possessed him. Whether drunk or sober he thought himself the lord proprietor
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and her citizens his tenants. He threatened suits of ejectment against those in
                    possession, and was often exceedingly abusive in his notices to quit. The only way to manage him was
                    by force, and it was frequently employed. He was often committed to jail, and there compelled to
                    remain for months. At that time the Mayor's office was in the row of buildings on Main
                    Cross street known as the buzzard roost, and the jail was immediately south of and back of it. Every
                    morning Murray would be at the window of his cell when the Mayor opened his office. So soon as he
                    saw that official he would commence to curse and abuse him. On these occasions it was his custom to
                    sing a doggerel song, running thus: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    less than the average flesh for one of his height, had stooped shoulders, and walked with his head
                    well forward and his eyes upon the ground. His life was one of vicissitudes. He was rich to-day and
                    poor to-morrow. <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-062-4-024"/> He failed in business in <placeName>

                    adversity; not so he. If he touched the bottom it was to reach a foundation for a rebound. He went
                    down under one wave and sprang in triumph upon the top of the next. His energy never gave way and
                    his industry never tired. He was a leader in every public enterprise of his day. <placeName>

                    net-work of railroads, but in this effort he failed. He saw the trade which had been hers directed
                    to other cities, and the sight made him sad. He left us and went elsewhere, but so long as the great
                    enterprises he inaugurated remain he will not be forgotten. It was eminently proper that his mortal
                    remains should be brought here and consigned to rest among a people for whom he had done so much.</p>

            <p>William G. Wharton was a prominent man at the time of which I speak. In stature he was tall and
                    straight. His physique was splendid. In earlier days he had been both a major of militia and a
                    justice of the peace. Apropos to this: Some years previous to this time he was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and meeting General Stapp at the Astor House he was prevailed upon to call upon
                    General Scott. Major Wharton was not given to running after great men, nor to crowding himself
                    anywhere uninvited; therefore, it was with reluctance that he consented to call upon the hero of
                    Lundy's Lane. But the persistency of General Stapp prevailed, and the two went to the rooms
                    of General Scott. General Stapp approached the great captain and said: "General Scott,
                    allow me to present my friend, Major Wharton." "I am happy to know you,
                    Major," said the General; "to what part of the service do you belong? "
                    "I am an officer by brevet," said the Major; "I am from the great West
                    where every man is a major or (bowing to Stapp) a general." Major Wharton used to tell this
                    story with great gusto.</p>
            <p>At this time, deeds signed by married women, to be valid had <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-062-4-025"/> to
                    be acknowledged by the wives, separate and apart from and without the hearing of their husbands.
                    Major Wharton was a notary public, as also was William McKee Dunn. The latter took the
                    acknowledgment of a deed from Wharton and his wife and inadvertently signed the Major's
                    name to the certificate instead of his own. Judge Billy Hendricks saw this deed in the
                    Recorder's office and determined to have some fun out of the mistake. Observing Wharton on
                    the street he called him to the office. "How is it, Major," said the Judge,
                    "that you certify under your oath of office that you have examined your wife separate and
                    apart from and without the hearing of her husband? " "What do you mean?
                    "asked the Major. "I mean," answered the Judge, "that you have
                    done this thing, and here is the evidence of it." With that he proceeded to read as
                    follows:</p>

                    examined separate and apart from and without the hearing of her said husband, declared that she,

                    Major.</p>
            <p>Major Wharton was a devoted Mason. He was a Methodist, but he placed his lodge above his church. One
                    day he came into the office of the Firemen and Mechanics Insurance Company and applied to the late
                    Caleb T. Lodge, then president of the company, for a permit to smoke meat in his warehouse, on which
                    that company had written a policy. There was a controversy about the rate to be charged, when
                    Wharton petulantly <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-062-4-026"/> said: "I'll have nothing
                    to do with your company; all insurance companies are swindling concerns." "I am
                    surprised, Squire," said Mr. Lodge, "that a good Methodist, like yourself, should
                    belong to a swindling concern." (Mr. Wharton was a stockholder in the company.)
                    "Don't quote Methodism to me," responded the Squire; "the other
                    day I wanted some shingles and went to the yard of Mr.—, a brother Methodist, to buy
                    them. I selected the shingles I wanted and ordered them sent to my house. Those received were not
                    those I bought, but were greatly inferior. Had I bought the shingles of old man Todd—a
                    hell-bound sinner—I should have received what I bargained for. He is a good Mason, and
                    show me a good Mason and I'll show you a good man."</p>

                    was both a minister of the gospel and a minister of justice. On Sunday he dispensed gospel truths
                    with a pure hand, and during the week he dispensed justice with an even one. He united in wedlock

            <p>In the summer and fall of 1847 the Fifth Indiana regiment was formed. It rendezvoused at <placeName>

                    </placeName> contributed a company to this regiment. It was commanded by Captain Horace Hull, who
                    had for his lieutenants DeWitt C. Ritch, John M. Lord and John M. Lattimore. This regiment never was
                    in battle, but one day it came so close to Santa Anna that, in his hurry to get away, he left behind
                    his wooden leg. It became a trophy of the war and was highly prized by the Hoosier soldiers.</p>
            <p>It was by the action of these three companies of <placeName>

                    became possessed of the richest mineral lands in the world, and surely she owes a debt of gratitude
                    to the brave men who made it possible for her to obtain them. The denial to these men of a

            <p>Early in September, 1846, Crooked creek overflowed its banks, whereby eleven persons were drowned and
                    over $100,000 worth of property destroyed. The flood was in daylight, otherwise the loss
                    of life would have been much greater. Skiffs were taken from the river to the creek, and the lives
                    of many persons thereby saved. At that time Crooked creek flowed through a culvert under the
                    railroad track. This culvert was completely blocked with houses that had been swept from their
                    foundations. The pent up water overflowed the banks of the creek and submerged the adjacent bottom
                    lands. The woolen mill of Whitney &amp; Hendricks, the oil mill of Jacob Shuh, a large part of
                    the pork-house of Mitchel &amp; McNaughten, and several dwelling houses were borne away by the
                    raging water. The bodies of the drowned were recovered and inquests held upon them; and to
                    illustrate the public economy of those times, it may be proper to say that the Board of County
                    Commissioners considered the holding of these inquests unnecessary, and objected to paying their
                    cost out of the county treasury.</p>

                    </placeName> was a peaceable city. Burglaries and other high crimes were uncommon, and homicides
                    were almost unknown. There was, however, one murder committed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it created intense excitement at the time. It was the killing of Joseph Howard by
                    Henry Holtzclaw. The Holtzclaws—William, the father, and Henry, Eli and Thomas, the sons,
                    came from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and opened a wholesale grocery store on West street. Thomas created a disturbance one
                    Sunday evening at Wesley Chapel, and the next day a warrant for his arrest was issued, and placed in
                    the hands of Howard, who was a constable. Howard went to the Holtzclaw store to make the arrest,
                    where he got into a personal difficulty with the father and the sons. He was a strong man as well as
                    a courageous one, and seizing Thomas by the collar of his coat, he dragged him out of the <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-062-4-029"/> house. He was followed by the father and brothers, and when in
                    the middle of the street was shot by Henry and mortally wounded. The Holtzclaws were arrested and
                    admitted to bail, and then fled the country. Sometime afterwards Eli was rearrested in the South and
                    brought here by a brother of his victim. By this time two of the most important witnesses were gone.
                    Langtree had been drowned and Weide had removed to <placeName>

                    </placeName>; so their testimony could not be had. Holtzclaw took a change of venue to an adjoining
                    county, and in the absence of these witnesses was tried and acquitted.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> neighbors. Runaway slaves were hunted over the hills and through the valleys of
                    Jefferson. The abolition settlement in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> township was considered a plague-spot on the body politic. The Hoyts, the Nelsons and
                    the Tibbettses of that neighborhood, although honorable and peaceable men, were tabooed because they
                    believed in the equality of all men before the law. The Euletherian school at College Hill received
                    the maledictions of the people, because in it the fountain of knowledge was as free to the negro as
                    to the white man. Dwelling houses which had been erected near this college for the use of colored
                    students were burned and destroyed. It is no wonder that in a community where Southern sentiments
                    were so common the duel should be considered a proper method for settling disputes. Although we
                    never had a duel here, we had several narrow escapes from meetings under the code. John Abram

                    between Messrs. Hendricks and King occasioned much feeling in the city. They were both young men of
                    promise and were sons of leading citizens. Mr. Hendricks had been an officer in the regular army,

                    a challenge and sent it by a Mr. Rowan. Mr. King refused acceptance of the challenge, giving as a
                    reason for the refusal that he was not on equal terms with his enemy; that his acceptance would
                    subject him to the penalty of the law of Indiana, while Mr. Hendricks would escape such penalty by
                    reason of having written the challenge in another State. Upon receiving this reply Mr. Hendricks
                    came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, opposite this city, and wrote another challenge, without naming the place where it was
                    written. This paper was delivered to Mr. King by Abram W. Hendricks, Esq., and the invitation
                    declined because it lacked a venue. By this time the difficulty was widely known, and coming to the
                    knowledge of <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-062-4-031"/> Governor Hendricks and Victor King, the fathers of
                    the belligerents, they interfered and prevented a hostile meeting.</p>
            <p>The difficulty between Messrs. Marshall and Bright originated at a political meeting which took place
                    at Ritchey's Mills in this county. Inasmuch as I wrote an account of this matter some years
                    ago for the <hi rend="i">

                    here.</p>
            <p>The trouble between Mr. Bright and Mr. Brough grew out of a controversy in relation to selling the
                    State's interest in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Railroad. Mr. Bright challenged Mr. Brough, but, instead of accepting the challenge,
                    the latter published it in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>

                        </placeName> Banner</hi> with the reasons for his refusal. In speaking of this difficulty the
                    late George D. Prentice said in his paper that most persons would think Mr. Bright would have the
                    advantage of Mr. Brough in a duel, on account of the great size of the latter, but, in fact, the
                    advantage would be on the other side, as it was doubtful if the pistol was then made which could
                    send a bullet to Mr. Brough's vitals. He was a behemoth in size.</p>
            <p>The difficulty between Messrs. Sproule and Hendricks grew out of political differences, and was not
                    generally known. Sproule was the challenger, and he sent the hostile message by Michael Steele
                    Bright. Nothing came of it, and the matter was soon adjusted.</p>

            <p>The two previous installments of the minutes of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library Company traced the history of this organization from its founding in July,
                    1806, through the major crises which seriously threatened its survival, the War of 1812 and the
                    Panic of 1819. Fortunately the company did not share the destiny common to such early cultural
                    agencies—an inability to sustain itself during crises—and the period from 1823
                    to 1838, covered in the following installment, was one of recovery, renewed vigor, and growth.</p>
            <p>In part this revitalization was related to the improvement of the national economy in which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> shared in a number of ways. Its population doubled between 1820 and 1840 (from 1,029 to
                    2,131), the steamboat made the city a mercantile center on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, and it experienced the birth pangs of industrialization by the founding of the Bonner
                    Cotton Factory (1825) and the Eagle Glove Factory (1830). The city's economic growth had
                    its cultural parallel in the opening of a score of parochial, private, and public academies,
                    seminaries, and institutes, and in an abortive attempt to establish a medical school. Also during
                    the thirties its theatre company was reorganized and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Lyceum was founded.</p>
            <p>Some credit is also due to the dedication and ability of certain individuals who served as company
                    officers. One such man was John Cleves Symmes Harrison, company librarian from 1823 to 1830, whose
                    obituary notice in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> (November 13, 1830) stated that "had it not been aided by his
                    constant and untiring exertions … the Library Company of this place would have
                    deteriorated and probably have been dissolved."</p>
            <p>Whether for economic reasons or for the quality of its leadership, by the late 1830's the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Library Company had survived the early crises and had entered its period of maximum

                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In editing these minutes every effort has been made to reproduce
                        faithfully the spelling and capitalization of the handwritten document. The spacing of the
                        original minutes has been somewhat modified and standardized. For example, space limitations
                        have prompted the listing of members present at a meeting, results of elections, and books
                        recommended for purchase in series instead of the columns which usually appear in the minutes.
                        Paragraphs have been indented consistently even though in the document many were not indented.
                        Frequently items of business—especially motions and resolutions—were
                        recorded on separate successively indented lines; these have been reproduced in standard
                        paragraph form. The openings and closings of minutes and locations of headings also have been
                        standardized. Punctuation has been reproduced as it appeared with the following exceptions:
                        periods have been added where necessary at the ends of paragraphs, closings of minutes, and
                        after abbreviations and initials; commas and semicolons have been added when columns of names
                        are reproduced in series; a colon has been added after the word "present" when
                        it precedes a list of members attending a meeting, after the word "viz." when
                        it introduces a series, and occasionally where it clarifies the intent of the secretary; decimal
                        points have been inserted where they were missing in prices; and hyphens have been used
                        consistently between inclusive numbers in lists of numbered books. Flourishes have been omitted
                        or translated as periods; underlining of signatures, dates, and the like has been considered a
                        flourish except where it clearly indicates italics. Raised letters have been brought down to the
                        line. Unintentional repetitions of words or phrases have been omitted, as have marks in the
                        margins and words, phrases, or subtotals used in making transitions from one page to the next in
                        the original minutes. No attempt has been made to give biographical data on individuals whose

                    in this Library, and whereas this fact being unknown to the Librarian, the legal Representatives of

            <p>On Motion of Mr. Law. It was Resolved That all the Books Papers and other Documents, connected with
                    the financial concerns of the Library be handed over to J. B. Martin our Treasurer.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Law. It was Resolved that the Treasurer be requested to make out a list of <hi rend="i">all</hi> the Stockholders, the amount due from each—and the names of those
                    whose shares it would be good policy to forfeit.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Gibson. Resolved that the Treasurer pay to R. Y. Caddington the sum of Thirty
                    Dollars for printing the Catalogue of Books in the Library out of the first monies in his hands.</p>
            <p>On motion of S. Hill Resolved That the Catalogues be deposited with the Treasurer.</p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. Hill. Resolved. That this association regret the decease of their late venerable and
                    worthy President Jn. Badollet Esqr. and that a list of the Books bequeathed by him to this
                    institution be registered on the minute book and numbered with the Books of the Library and that all

            <p>Science has played a key role in the development of modern civilization. It is therefore appropriate
                    that the Indiana Academy of Science should participate in the sesquicentennial celebration of the
                    State of Indiana, whose economic growth and development owe so much to the work of its scientists.</p>
            <p>The academy's participation in this celebration took the form of a special symposium at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, followed by this commemorative volume in which the papers presented at that
                    time are published. The papers summarize the present knowledge regarding the natural resources of
                    the state and what is being done with and to these resources. Some forty-four scientists served as
                    authors or coauthors of these papers. They came from fifteen colleges and universities in the state,
                    as well as from governmental and other agencies, and included outstanding leaders in the various
                    fields represented. These authors were asked to prepare their papers with the general public in mind
                    so that the published version would be of widespread value to the citizens of Indiana. This they
                    have done with considerable success.</p>
            <p>The volume was edited by Alton A. Lindsey who also contributed the opening chapter dealing with the
                    Indiana scene of 150 years ago. This furnishes a fitting background against which to measure and
                    evaluate the changes that have occurred during the past century and a half.</p>
            <p>The thirty-three chapters cover a wide range of subjects, the emphasis in all cases being on the
                    natural environment. Thus, the broad fields of geology and geography, meteorology, biology,
                    anthropology, forestry, and agriculture are stressed, whereas laboratory sciences, such as physics,
                    chemistry, and mathematics are not included.</p>
            <p>In the fields of geology and geography there are articles on bedrock geology, the ice ages and their
                    effect on the land, physiography, soils, lakes and streams, ground water, caves, and mineral
                    resources. Chapters on climate and bioclimate follow. In the area of biology, chapters are devoted
                    to the algae, fleshy fungi, plant diseases, lower green land plants, higher plants, plant
                    communities, forestry, limnology, insects, invertebrates other than insects, animal parasites,
                    insect pests, cave fauna, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, and mammals. Anthropological
                    interest centers on chapters dealing with the cultural and racial history of the Indians. There are
                    articles devoted to changing patterns in agriculture, population, and the state park system.</p>
            <p>It can thus be seen that the coverage is broad indeed. The reader will find that the various chapters
                    paint a vivid picture of Indiana geography, soils, climatic characteristics, agricultural practices
                    and position, mineral resources, and plant and animal life. Considerable emphasis is laid on the
                    importance of conserving, so far as possible, <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-062-4-074"/> the natural
                    heritage. To quote from Lindsey's introductory chapter— "thoughtful
                    trusteeship, not all-out technological bludgeoning of Nature, is needed from now on. … We
                    serve our continuing interests better by respecting, understanding and working along with natural
                    processes than by ignoring or opposing them. A square deal for environment is essential for future
                    prosperity and viability …" (p. xxvii).</p>
            <p>This unique and attractive volume is a fitting contribution to the celebration of Indiana's
                    150th birthday.</p>

                        Christ) in Indiana.</hi> By Henry K. Shaw ([<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>]: The Bethany Press, for the Association of the Christian Churches in Indiana, 1966.
                    Pp. 535. Notes, illustrations, appendices, bibliography, index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>If Hoosier Disciples had continued their early policy of avoiding written records relating to their
                    beliefs and activities, the author of the present volume would have been in for a frustrating
                    experience. A report of the 1829 Indiana Christian Conference typifies their reluctance to put
                    anything down in writing: "The brethren, after conversing freely, unanimously agreed, to
                    lay aside the Minute-Book for the present, for the following reason, viz: That some of our dear
                    brethren were opposed to it" (p. 34). The Disciples wanted no creedal interpretations or
                    written commentary that might pose a threat to the Bible's "pure"
                    contents and the individual's right to seek his salvation in the Scriptures. As a corollary
                    to this conviction, they hoped to avoid any kind of church organization that might force uniformity
                    among the brethren.</p>
            <p>Conditions on the frontier encouraged such spiritual independence, and the success of the Disciples
                    of Christ is evidence that a large segment of the frontier population found it appealing. But as the
                    conditions which prompted the Disciples movement began to alter, so did the movement itself.
                    "Through bitter experience they learned that their cherished freedom often led to
                    fragmentation…. The primary struggle by Hoosier Disciples for a century and a quarter was
                    a search for guide lines of effective cooperation" (pp. 468–69). Thus, in many
                    respects, Shaw's book is an account of an "anti-institutional" religious
                        <hi rend="i">movement</hi> transforming itself into a modern, complex religious <hi rend="i">institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Hoosier Disciples</hi> is more chronicle than comprehensive history. It is a factual,
                    period-by-period summarization of the Indiana Disciples of Christ churches from their origin during
                    the Indiana territorial years through 1965. Shaw traces not only the evolution of the central
                    governing body of the association, but he also records the development of several ancillary
                    organizations and agencies which are now integral parts of the Disciples' efforts in
                    Indiana. These include the United Christian Mission Society, the Christian Theological Seminary, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University. The data required to depict all of this becomes almost encyclopedic in
                    scope.</p>
            <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-062-4-075"/>
            <p>The author has had access to excellent source materials which have been collected over many decades
                    at the Christian Theological Seminary and other Disciples' depositories in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    the objectivity, necessary in preparing such an ambitious book. As indicated by the footnotes, Shaw
                    has relied most heavily on various periodicals published by the Disciples, beginning with Barton W.
                    Stone's <hi rend="i">Christian Messenger</hi> of the 1820's. The finished work
                    demonstrates the informational value of such sources for the historian.</p>
            <p>The book should attract members of the Disciples' persuasion, for much of its content is
                    designed for them. The non-Disciple can make use of it too, particularly if he is interested in
                    tracing the elusive trends which have resulted in the present religious synthesis in the Hoosier
                    State.</p>
            <p>A central theme of the book, more implied than stated, is the accommodation of rural viewpoints to
                    urban circumstances. How the Disciples and other religious groups have managed to accomplish this to
                    the degree they have remains an intriguing facet of social history.</p>

                    considering the mass of material dealt with these are pardonable. Shaw might be criticized for a

               <hi rend="i">The Letters of George Catlin and his Family: A Chronicle of the American West.</hi>
                    By Marjorie Catlin Roehm. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Berkeley</settlement>

            <p>Unquestionably the best known name among the several artists who painted American Indians and western
                    subjects in the nineteenth century is George Catlin. His unusual career, indomitable spirit, and
                    extraordinary achievements made him an intriguing figure during his lifetime and a fascinating
                    subject for historians and biographers in recent years. Since Lloyd Haberley's <hi rend="i">Pursuit of the Horizon</hi> appeared in 1948, five books dealing with Catlin's life
                    and work have been published, the latest being this one by Marjorie Catlin Roehm.</p>
            <p>Previous authors have relied for their information on Catlin's own extensive writings and on
                    old newspaper and magazine articles. Very few letters were known. The approach to the subject and
                    the manner of telling the story varied according to each biographer's viewpoint, but they
                    all used the same source material.</p>
            <p>This book is entirely different. As might be expected from the title, it is a compilation of letters
                    written by different members of the Catlin family, chronologically arranged, and tied together with
                    brief historical notes that enable the reader to grasp better the sequence of events. The letters
                    are intended to throw as much new light as possible <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-062-4-076"/> on George
                    Catlin; but the pivotal figure is his father Putnam, whose letters to different members of the
                    family seem to contain the most news about the clan. They also contain the admonitions, hopes, and
                    fears of a devoted but stern father. One does not get far into the book before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his flock come to life.</p>
            <p>According to the Preface, all of the letters written by George appear in their entirety because of
                    his greater importance. Many letters by other Catlins have been omitted because they have little or
                    no bearing on the artist's career. Most members of the family wrote well, but it is not the
                    literary style of the epistles that gives the book its significance. The correspondence helps to
                    fill in certain gaps in George's activities and to clarify or correct some previous
                    statements about him. The general reader, whether interested in pioneer painters or not, will
                    doubtless find that the letters reveal in an intriguing way the personal relationships of members of
                    a good, forthright American family living in the middle years of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>These letters were only recently discovered in an old, small trunk. The author, a granddaughter of
                    George Catlin's youngest brother Francis, has compiled the material with skill and
                    discrimination; and she is to be commended upon the straightforward and candid commentaries
                    sprinkled throughout the book. The lives of her ancestors have not been glossed over nor tinted with
                    rosy colors.</p>
            <p>If the reader is introduced to George Catlin through this book of letters rather than through one of
                    the previously published biographical narratives, he would do well to read one of the
                    latter—particularly one that is well illustrated. Otherwise he has no idea of the style,
                    quality, or appearance of the paintings and drawings themselves. After all, it is the <hi rend="i">work</hi> of the artist that really counts.</p>

            <p>For many students of government management and finance, this book will almost certainly be
                    disturbing, for its findings are anything but orthodox. It is this very aspect of the study,
                    however, which is most intriguing. Anton's subject is the process of making expenditure
                    decisions for state government in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> for the 1963–1965 biennium. He treats these expenditure decisions as a
                    social action system and acknowledges the influence of the Parsonian school. In delineating his area
                    of concern, he specifically limits his study to observation of state officials charged with the
                    budgeting and appropriating process and confines his examination to "general-fund"
                    expenditures. While he does not attempt to examine the operation of the decision system over time,
                    he provides adequate historical background.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking findings of the study, and one that Anton acknowledges as highly
                    significant, is that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> budgeting and appropriating system has almost no relationship to the substantive
                    programs <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-062-4-077"/> or policies of state agencies. Major policy changes
                    with significant expenditure implications must come from outside the budgeting-appropriating system,
                    since the very structure of the system is biased against change. The major values of the system
                    include such ideas as balancing the budget and routinely cutting agency requests at the review
                    stage; its forms are focused on the "book," or budget document, and appropriation
                    bills in the legislature. Evaluation of agency performance or public service needs is not relevant.</p>
            <p>As in all decision making, key elements in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> expenditure system are the store of available information and the communications
                    network. By virtue of nearly complete control of both, the budget superintendent becomes one of the
                    most powerful actors. His influence is exceeded only by that of the governor; but since the latter
                    is frequently a relative newcomer, he suffers because of lack of detailed knowledge of the game.</p>
            <p>Other major findings are that the remaining formal participants— primarily the budget
                    review commission and the legislators—simply do not have sufficient information or time
                    to consider the policy implications of expenditure proposals and that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> system falls far short of the standard models of budgeting.</p>
            <p>This summary review of the author's conclusions tends to obscure the relatively heavy
                    theoretical emphasis of the book. Anton does a careful job of discussing his subject in terms of his
                    chosen conceptual framework, and he does not claim to develop a new model which might fit the events
                    he describes. The latter is a little disappointing, but such an attempt would probably have made the
                    task unmanageable as a single project.</p>
            <p>Because the study hews so carefully to its defined objectives, some of the more exciting aspects of
                    expenditure decisions, such as the process by which it was decided to undertake a major expansion of
                    the mental health program, and some of the other influence patterns, such as legislator-agency
                    relationships and the role of interest groups, are necessarily left aside. It is interesting to
                    speculate what meaning Anton's findings and future studies of a comparative nature may have
                    for attempts already under discussion to graft the new federal concept of the "planning,
                    programming, budgeting system" onto state and local patterns of expenditure decisions.</p>

            <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-062-4-078"/>
            <p>Although Simon has utilized the most important of the numerous secondary accounts bearing on his
                    subject, he has relied mainly on primary sources. These include the records of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> House of Representatives for the four sessions in which Lincoln was a member

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s principal contemporaries. From these sources Simon has succeeded in
                    reconstructing a virtual day by day account of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s legislative activities for each session.</p>
            <p>Lincoln was not a great legislator. Simon admits this and suggests that only when a moral issue such
                    as slavery came up was there any hint of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s future greatness. During these four terms, however, Lincoln was thoroughly
                    indoctrinated into frontier politics and earned for himself a statewide reputation as a vigorous and
                    effective party leader. His freshman term was of little significance. His major contributions to
                    legislation, however, occurred during his second and third terms. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> served in the infamous Tenth General Assembly that adopted the fantastic internal
                    improvements program which plunged <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> into an unwarranted and extraordinarily burdensome debt. Simon censures <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who voted consistently for the internal improvements projects, for his lack of wisdom
                    and foresight. This same session was also responsible for the transfer of the state capital from
                    Vandalia to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Here Simon clarifies <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s role in the intrigue associated with this move and, in general, absolves him
                    from any unethical behind-the-scenes deals.</p>
            <p>Simon is far more successful in chronicling events than in explaining them. Only the most ardent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> buffs will bother to read page after page of detailed accounts of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s voting record in the house. On occasion Simon raises a question which
                    arouses the curiosity of the reader but then leaves it unanswered. The reader is informed, for
                    example, that in the 1840–1841 session, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> voted in favor of an unsuccessful measure authorizing a woman in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vermilion County</region>
                    </placeName> to give property to the Society of Friends. No explanation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s vote follows nor is the reader ever told why in the absence of such a law
                    the woman could not convey her property to the Quakers.</p>
            <p>Simon's well-researched book is free of glaring factual errors, but not all of the
                    author's assumptions are justified. A reference to a "Little Judge" in an
                    1839 letter is automatically assumed to be a reference to Stephen A. Douglas. Douglas was not
                    elected to the supreme court until 1841 and acquired his title of Judge Douglas at that time. The
                    name "Little Giant" was first applied to him when he became active in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
                    </placeName> politics rather than later when he served with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the Tenth General Assembly as Simon states.</p>

                    there is no bibliography, the index is adequate; and the notes are at the bottom of the page where

            <p>This book is a history of the Mormon settlement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> as it flourished at Nauvoo from 1839 to 1846. To this site on the <geogName>Mississippi
                        River</geogName> north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Joseph Smith led his people after they had failed to build a kingdom on earth either
                    at Kirtland, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, or in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> near Independence. In both of these places the Mormons had had trouble with their
                    "gentile" neighbors because the Mormons dominated the local economy, got control
                    of political offices, and outraged non-Mormons by their heterodox religious practices.</p>
            <p>Smith hoped to make Nauvoo a spiritual center for his followers and at the same time develop the area
                    into an agricultural and industrial empire. But he failed to achieve his ambitious goals. The
                    Prophet was killed while in jail awaiting a hearing on a charge that he had broken the laws of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In the general uprising that followed the Mormons were forced to leave their homes and
                    businesses. The leadership of the Nauvoo community fell to Brigham Young who eventually formed a
                    Mormon state in the Far West.</p>
            <p>Flanders provides a detailed history of the founding and progress of the Mormons at Nauvoo. He
                    discusses the complicated and sometimes irregular land purchases and sales of the Mormons, and the
                    economic difficulties they experienced; he describes the methods of recruiting new Saints in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>; and he tells about the tight hold Smith had on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nauvoo city</settlement>
                    </placeName> government due to a favorable charter given by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> legislature. Full treatment is also given to the maneuvering of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> politicians to get the Morman vote and the consequent resentment of members of the
                    party which did not get Smith's support. Finally, Flanders describes the disputes and
                    antagonisms that arose among the Mormons themselves. He deals with the matter of plural marriage and
                    notes how this and other matters of theology caused deep divisions among the Mormons and aroused
                    distrust and fear of them by non-Mormons.</p>
            <p>Better than most historians of Joseph Smith and the Mormons, Flanders preserves an objective
                    position. He notes the mistakes made by Smith in temporal matters; but he also points out that it
                    was Smith's charismatic nature that enabled him to be such a vigorous, persuasive, and
                    successful spiritual leader. The book rests upon very complete examination of Mormon and non-Mormon
                    sources, and it brings together the results of modern research in Mormon studies. It does not,
                    however, offer any new explanation for the rise and fall of Nauvoo.</p>
            <p>This work should be a best seller among books of its kind, not only because of its content, but also
                    because the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>

            <p>A volume of this kind is primarily a research tool, the conspicuous virtues of which must be
                    thoroughness and accuracy. Cecil K. Byrd, university librarian at Indiana University, has produced a
                    model book. He has drawn on the resources of over two hundred institutional and municipal libraries
                    plus five private collections. He has examined the books he lists, and he notes at least one
                    location for each item. Sufficiently full bibliographical data are provided for the specialist while
                    the background material is both helpful and interesting. Thus the reader is given succinct but
                    useful biographical accounts of such important early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> figures as Ninian Edwards, Morris Birkbeck, Peter Cart- wright, James Hall, John Mason
                    Peck, and John Reynolds. Material about early newspapers and magazines is presented, and the student
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> political or religious history will find considerable information about his specialty.
                    Certainly the published records of Baptist association meetings account for a substantial number of
                    items.</p>
            <p>The arrangement is properly chronological and the index is thorough. Not only are biographical and
                    geographical names listed, but collective references to poetry and sermons are also given (fiction
                    seems to have been neglected). The titles of newspapers alone comprise three columns of the index.
                    Nevertheless, it might have helped the reader if the authors of verse and fiction had been
                    identified. Only by paging through the volume can one discover that Horatio Cooke published a volume
                    of poems in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1843, that William Asbury Kenyon published another in 1845, and that William H.

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1854.</p>
            <p>An enterprise of this nature inevitably produces a strange kettle of fish. Side by side with the
                    legal codes, the directories, the church records, and the lists of lands on which taxes were still
                    due are curious <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-062-4-081"/> items which reflect the period covered. Joseph
                    Duncan, for example, issued a broadside in 1837 about his stud horse <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rob Roy</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1846 the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jersey County</region>
                    </placeName> Horse Thief Detecting Society published a list of the members' names, some
                    ninety-eight in all. Three years later an Oquawka horticulturist circulated a catalogue of fruit
                    trees which he offered for sale, and in 1850 the Northern Cross Railroad Company printed a report of
                    its experimental survey from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quincy</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Meredosia. By the 1850's the published programs of McVicker's
                    Theater and Rice's Theater in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> accounted for many items.</p>
            <p>Byrd has produced an invaluable reference volume which is also surprisingly readable. One wonders,
                    however, why the volume ends after forty-four years. The editor states bluntly that there is no
                    historical or bibliographical reason for concluding with the year 1858, and the terminal date seems
                    rather freakish. The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> fire of 1871 might have made a more logical termination. One can only hope for an
                    extension of the work in the future.</p>

            <p>Despite the possible inference of the title, this work is not a political discussion of the French
                    regime in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. Composed of fourteen papers originally
                    presented at a conference observing the bicentennial of the founding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1764, it describes many aspects of the history of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>: historical, architectural, literary, scientific, and bibliographical. All of the
                    essays are interestingly written and carefully researched. The variations in literary style simply
                    add charm to a volume which is well edited, scholarly, and informative.</p>
            <p>Quite appropriately the first six papers are either directly or tangentially connected with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The next five essays range widely from this central theme, dealing with contributions
                    of the French to the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> in general. The final three papers will
                    perhaps do most to "stimulate other investigations of French activities in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley"</geogName> (p. viii): the editor's hope for the
                    work. In these essays Noël Baillargeon, James M. Babcock, and Winston De Ville describe
                    and evaluate the source materials for the history of the French in the <geogName>Mississippi

            <p>Of especial interest to Indiana readers is Father Joseph P. Donnelly's discussion of Father
                    Pierre Gibault. Donnelly credits the "patriot priest" with contributing greatly to
                    the success of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

                    assistance to George Rogers Clark during the Revolution—which the author feels was not
                    the priest's greatest contribution to the <geogName>Mississippi
                    Valley</geogName>—and thus his connection with early Indiana history is briefly detailed.
                    Also related <pb n="354" id="VAA4025-062-4-082"/> to Indiana history is Joseph Ewan's study
                    of French naturalists in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. Along with John James Audubon,
                    the Michaux, and the Prat brothers, Ewan discusses Gerard Troost, Thomas Say, Charles Alexandre
                    Lesueur, the Maclures, and other naturalists who came to Robert Owen's <placeName>

            <p>Two papers in the volume are beautifully illustrated. Charles E. Peterson's architectural

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> during the French era should be technical enough to suit the professional but
                    interesting enough to please the amateur. In a second article, architectural historian Samuel

                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName>. The innumerable illustrations aid both presentations
                    immeasurably.</p>
            <p>Included in the fourteen essays is a paper describing the life and work of a comparatively unknown
                    French poet. Says Charles E. Guenther of his subject, "It was not extraordinary that among
                    the French immigrants who arrived in upper <placeName>

                        </placeName> Water West</hi> takes the reader back to 1724 when Cadwallader Colden, surveyor
                    general of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, sent a memorial to Governor William Burnet, with perhaps the first recognition of a
                    possible water connection between the <geogName>Hudson River</geogName> and the <geogName>Great
                        Lakes</geogName>. He ends the study with the year 1854, when the enlargement question was
                    finally resolved. In between are twenty chapters, dealing with the economic and political problems
                    of the times. Shaw recounts, for example, the spirited controversy between the villages of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Buffalo</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Black Rock to become the western terminus of the canal; and he describes the gala
                    celebrations which marked the completion of the canal in 1825. He also details the question of
                    enlargement, which embroiled <placeName>

                    </placeName> looms high above the rest, for his imagination, industry, and persistence transformed a
                    dream into a reality. Hoosiers will be interested in this book because the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal, directly and indirectly, contributed much to the development of the Midwest.</p>
            <p>Historians might criticize Shaw for failing to carry the story of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Canal to 1862, when the rebuilding of the canal was completed. Non-historians, more
                    interested in readability than in historical detail and interpretation, may criticize the book for
                    its heavy literary style. No one, however, can deny that Shaw has contributed an important and
                    scholarly study which fills a need and a void. Nor will anyone deny that Ronald E. Shaw merited the
                    1965 award for his well-researched manuscript. His "Essay on Bibliography" is well
                    done, the illustrations are adequate, and the index excellent. The University of <placeName>

            <p>The age of the automobile and the aeroplane has made ship travel on inland waters seem slow and
                    inconsequential to the ordinary observer; but when one contemplates closely the vastness of the
                        <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> of America, the importance of this waterway can be understood.
                    The more romantic pages of the history of these lakes relate the heroic efforts <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-062-4-084"/> of men to conquer the physical handicaps of water travel by the more
                    limited tools of an earlier age. Havighurst says that the aim of this book "is to recall
                    men and moments from the past" (p. xvii). Since he does not pretend to have told the only
                    or complete story, the reader who has other interests and likes a different collection of narratives
                    must be tolerant of Havighurst's choices.</p>
            <p>From the viewpoint of style and appeal, the passages are well chosen and are nearly all short enough
                    to attract the casual reader. The <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> do not have a medieval
                    literature, but material about the Indians and their traditions is abundant enough to deserve more
                    space in such a volume. The travel on <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> was quite different in
                    purpose from that on <geogName>Lake Superior</geogName>, but <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> was
                    the main route to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Country. One misses that romance of the Indians of the lower peninsula as found in
                    Julia Altrocchi's <hi rend="i">Wolves Against the Moon.</hi> The immigrants who came along
                    the <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> route in the early part of the nineteenth century are scarcely
                    mentioned.</p>
            <p>Unconsciously or by intent, the story is told predominantly in passages dealing with the vast mineral
                    deposits of <geogName>Lake Superior</geogName>: the search for them, the finding and extraction of
                    them, and the new struggle over them arising from foreign competitors brought about by the seaway.
                    Certainly, the enormous human effort that finally conquered Sault Saint Marie and brought out from
                        <geogName>Lake Superior</geogName> its mineral wealth is mirrored in the passages that the
                    editor has chosen. One of the very interesting episodes, incidentally, tells of a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> pharmacist who became the agent for speculating Yankees.</p>
            <p>The first section of the book conveys some notion of the bold sense of adventure of the <hi rend="i">voyageur</hi>, placing considerable emphasis on the value of the Indian canoe as the chief
                    means of travel. There is sufficient tribute to the devotion of the Jesuit missionaries to their
                    primitive peoples; yet, there is wanting a passage that would bring out the real hardships of their
                    advanced exploration. The book contains very little about the conflict between the idealism of the
                    missionary and the lust of the <hi rend="i">coureurs de bois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The passages that tell of the storms on the lakes together with the list of the dead in
                        <geogName>Lake Huron</geogName> in 1913 give the reader some notion of the danger involved in
                    shipping on the lakes. Throughout the book, no passage really should be read alone; some of the
                    brief episodes which seem to go nowhere contribute to the general understanding of longer and more
                    involved accounts. There is an element of humor in the episode of Charles T. Harvey, "The
                    Canalside Superintendent," and there is real pathos in the story of "The Christmas
                    Tree Schooner." The account of "The Long Ships" is not so exciting but
                    has an interest of its own in the effort to adapt the <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> shipping
                    fleet to changing circumstances. The final group of passages dealing with the "Cities and
                    Seaway" is perhaps too brief for all that is involved in the subject, but it serves to
                    indicate the present and the future of the seaways and affords some glance at the relevance of
                    Quebec to these inland seas.</p>

                    bibliographical notes, index. $7.95.)</head>
            <p>Douglas Leach completed his doctoral dissertation on King Philip's War over a decade and a
                    half ago; but he continues to mine his diggings on the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> frontier with an enthusiasm, vigor, and dilligence that should be inspirational to
                    young men just entering the historian's profession. Already known for <hi rend="i">Flint
                        Lock and Tomahawk</hi> (1958), an outcome of his dissertation, Leach, in <hi rend="i">The
                        Northern Colonial Frontier</hi>, has written a unique frontier study.</p>
            <p>Four sub-themes form the roots and branches that support and develop the great trunk of this study.
                    The conquest of geography, the fur trade, colonial land policy, and French-English rivalry are
                    interwoven to develop the northern frontier story as a racial conflict. In his Preface, Leach says
                    "How wonderful it would be if someone could write a history of the westward movement from
                    the Indian point of view." The Vanderbilt University professor has come as near to doing it
                    as possible. This is a brilliant accomplishment. There are few heroes in this book, for it is not a
                    study of men and their institutions. The figures who do merit Leach's attention are those
                    who were able to rise above the fundamental ethnocentrism of the European colonist. Penn, Williams,
                    Eliot, and Johnson are Leach's kind of men.</p>
            <p>Here we see starkly portrayed the failure of Christian theology to combat the egocentric materialism
                    of the Christian colonists who destroyed the Indian culture. The Indians saw, too, that the theology
                    preached had little relevance to the way the white man acted. Leach also shows the early
                    introduction of the Christian confusion that could justify theft of other people's land by
                    the materialist argument that cash had been paid (p. 39). The book, then, is about a kind of
                    "domestic imperialism," the exploitation of a race rather than natural resources
                    being the central concern. Leach is no maudlin romantic mooning over the degradation of the noble
                    savage, however, and gives adequate attention to the inhumanity of the red as well as the white man.
                    (For a statement counter to this racial interpretation see Alden T. Vaughn's <hi rend="i">New <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">England</country>
                        </placeName> Frontier: Puritans and Indians</hi>, pp. 62n-63n).</p>
            <p>The strands that are woven to produce this Indian tapestry must not be overlooked. Leach pays ample
                    attention to the Turner thesis. In this volume, one of eighteen under the editorship of Ray Allen
                    Billington in a <hi rend="i">History of the American Frontier</hi> series, the point is made that
                    the northern frontier was <hi rend="i">not</hi> just like the later western one; and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> master was not at all accurate in portraying it as such (pp. 207–10). That
                    the New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> pioneer was more likely to be collectivist and imitative than individualist and
                    innovative is pointed out over and over again. The four sub-themes listed at the beginning of this
                    review are developed with precision and originality.</p>
            <p>The book's failures are in large measure beyond the author's means to escape, for
                    they grow out of the attempt of the series to appeal to both the specialist and the general reader.
                    The index is woefully inadequate, whimsically constructed, and inconsistent. The writing style, <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-062-4-086"/> while never dull, is less vibrant and colorful than popular
                    readers would like, although occasional sparks appear. And when will the trade publishers get over
                    their silly insistence on segregating the footnotes in their own place at the back of the book! The
                    price—$7.95 for 210 pages of text—is much too high. There are eight
                    helpful maps and twenty-eight illustrations that will not be new to the scholar.</p>
            <p>This unique contribution to frontier history is a real achievement in developing a highly original
                    view, thoroughly grounded on primary sources, in a manner of genuine relevance to the mid-twentieth
                    century world.</p>

            <p>The author says she has pitched this volume at the general reader, but it also has enough depth to
                    enlighten those who already know something abount Indians, including anthropologists. The book
                    describes Indian religions at the time of first white contact, which varies from the middle
                    1600's in the east to the middle 1800's in the far north and west. The emphasis is
                    on behavior in ceremonies rather than on verbalizations about beliefs. The author rightly infers
                    that "action came before thinking" (p. 38) and wisely stresses ceremonies, which
                    are much better reported in primary sources than are the subtleties of belief.</p>
            <p>The book contains twenty-three chapters, thirty-four illustrations (mostly half tones), and four
                    maps. The first map gives the six language phyla of Sapir, 1929, which are now known to be incorrect
                    in some respects; but the other maps are up to date. Careful reading by the professional will reveal
                    a few errors in the text. For instance, Chilkat blankets are said to contain dog wool (p. 1). This
                    is not true; the only blankets made of dog wool were those of the Salish speaking peoples of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">British Columbia</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="aku">Alaska</region>
                    </placeName>. A few trivial errors of this nature do not detract from the overall accuracy of the
                    volume.</p>
            <p>Historical inferences for the pre-Columbian period are plausible and tenable in all cases. For
                    instance, the author suggests that the earliest immigrants to the New World practiced only rites
                    connected with female physiology (birth, menstruation) and death. Such ceremonies were universal
                    among Indians at first white contact and were conducted by families in the areas lacking more
                    complex social organization. Contacts with neighboring peoples gave rise to diffusions or borrowings
                    of both whole ceremonies and smaller details, such that every ceremony at white contact was a
                    conglomerate of ancient survivals, borrowings of all ages, and local inventions as well. Although
                    most of the book is devoted to description of various tribes and culture areas at first white
                    contact or as soon after as data are available, there is a <pb n="359" id="VAA4025-062-4-087"/>
                    little documentary history in a number of chapters and a considerable amount in the last chapter on
                    modern religions.</p>
            <p>Underbill is one of the best writers in anthropology as the following quotation shows: "One
                    of my most dramatic memories is that of standing in the plaza of a Pueblo, in the dark of a January
                    morning, to watch the Mother of Game bring in the deer. It was almost dawn when we heard the
                    hunter's call from the hillside. Then shadowy forms came bounding down through the
                    piñon trees. At first we could barely see the shaking horns and dappled hides. Then the
                    sun's rays picked out men on all fours, with deerskins over their backs and painted staves
                    in their hands to simulate forelegs. They leaped and gamboled before the people while around them
                    pranced little boys who seemed actually to have the spirit of fawns" (p. 117).</p>
            <p>On the whole this book is the best on its subject to date and will appeal to a wide audience. It may
                    be classed as text, trade, reference, or all three and can be read with profit by professionals in
                    both the behavioral sciences and the humanities, including historians.</p>

            <p>This slender volume re-examines many of the precepts by which Americans have been guided since 1830.
                    It also raises anew many arguments which no doubt will go into perpetuity. The author has sought the
                    central theme or tradition in historical writings dealing with an expanding America. He of necessity
                    has had to review the conflicts between old and new world cultures and between the simple
                    agrarianism and the rising complex industrialism. In examining the adjustments of Americans to their
                    new-found environment, historians have come under many intellectual and physical influences ranging
                    from that of the mythical second covenant of salvation between God and man to the philosophies of
                    Locke, Rousseau, Jefferson, and others. Triumph of the common man, some historians have said, came
                    in the 1830's with the elevation of Andrew Jackson to the presidency of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>American historians no doubt, as Noble says, have constantly searched for answers to the question of
                    how the country attained uniqueness and resisted alien influences. From George Bancroft to Daniel
                    Boorstin, historians have tried either to explain this fact or to refute it in many of its parts.</p>
            <p>Bancroft has had a vast and no doubt undue influence on American historians, even on those who have
                    never read his history. The simple Calvinistic doctrine of predestinarianism had meaning for
                    Americans. So did the simplicity of Puritanism. Beginning with no actual cultured heritage, as
                    Bancroft saw America, the Republic built its cultural structure on a simple rural agrarianism.
                    Humble leaders such as George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Daniel <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Boone</region>
                    </placeName> were <pb n="360" id="VAA4025-062-4-088"/> destined to bring about the fulfillment of
                    the covenant. It was they who would lead the conquest. It was they who would help the people step
                    out of a feudal past. To Bancroft the sprawling frontier was a "garden" not to be
                    despoiled once again by the sordid bickerings of man, especially political man.</p>
            <p>Beard and Turner perhaps synthesized much of the conflict between agrarian expansion and the
                    industrial revolution and the various contradictions which arose. It was Carl Becker, however, who
                    best revealed the changing viewpoints of the American historian with the passing years and the
                    gaining of experience as a historian. Becker's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> experience tarnished some of the shine of the frontier for the eager young historian.
                    In two perceptive essays the author traces the transition of Carl Becker from an idealistic
                    frontiersman to a historian willing to accept the dynamics of technology and industrial revolution.
                    In his later years Becker greatly revised his belief in the ability of the common man to achieve
                    democracy and to make the great plan necessary for its future operation. Beard, too, viewed the
                    revolution of the twentieth century from a sharply revised perspective—even though he was
                    highly cynical about the capacity of the capitalist plutocracy to survive.</p>
            <p>In his concluding chapter, the author examines the points of departure of Daniel Boorstin between the
                    publication of <hi rend="i">The Mysterious Science of Law</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Genius of
                        American Politics.</hi> By 1962, and in the <hi rend="i">Images</hi>, Noble says Boorstin
                    reached the point at which he seemed "to deny much of the intellectual position he had
                    constructed over the last decade. He appeared to have discovered a more fearful threat to American
                    innocence than those which had haunted Bancroft, Turner, Parrington, and Beard. He found corruption
                    within the ‘people’" (p. 173).</p>
            <p>This book raises many old questions and provokes many new ones. It raises no greater new one than
                    whether or not middle twentieth-century America has fulfilled the covenant of the garden and the
                    great dream.</p>

            <p>Among congressmen of the 1790's Fisher Ames, representative from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, acquired a notable reputation as a hard-core Federalist and an outstanding orator. He
                    reached the peak of his fame midway in the decade in defense of the treaty which Federalist John Jay
                    had negotiated with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The treaty provoked dispute throughout the country, and in the House rebellious
                    Republicans moved to block the necessary appropriations. "A Jupiter was needed,"
                    Bernhard writes, "who could hurl thunderbolts and confound the enemy. Federalists turned to
                    Ames" (p. 267). They were turning to a sick man. "Mr. Chairman," he
                    began, "I entertain the hope, perhaps a rash one, that <pb n="361" id="VAA4025-062-4-089"/>
                    my strength will hold me out to speak <hi rend="i">a</hi> few minutes" (p. 268). For over
                    an hour the sick man held the floor in "a display of oratory which remained unsurpassed in
                    his generation" (p. 268). Some in the audience wept, and all were moved. It is possible
                    that some votes changed as a result—it is known that the House Republicans were soon
                    defeated—although all Bernhard can say is that "it is reasonable to assume that
                    Ames's speech had a strong influence on the final outcome" (p. 272).</p>
            <p>Bernhard is not one to go off the deep end, which is easy to do with a man like Ames. Die-hard
                    Federalists—of whom there have been few—have admired Ames. Jeffersonians have
                    scorned him. Jeffersonian liberals, like Parrington, have portrayed him as a hysterical reactionary.
                    (To Ames, Parrington would have been a mere "democratick babbler.") After Ames retired from
                    Congress in 1797 he turned to writing, trying to turn the tide of "Jacobinical"
                    Republicanism. The country, he warned, was "sliding down into the mire of a
                    democracy" (p. 337).</p>
            <p>For most twentieth-century readers, Ames is a man who needs explanation. The mockery of Parrington is
                    of little help. And this biography, objective as it is, offers little by way of explanation or
                    analysis. What it does present is a comprehensive account of what Ames did and said, and
                    particularly what part he took in each congressional issue of the time.</p>
            <p>Since it is the first, and will probably be the last, full-length biography of Ames, it will be read
                    and cited. But granting that a full-length biography of a notable American of the past is a
                    meritorious project, it is hard to think of this one as a prize winner. (It won the 1963 Manuscript
                    Award of the Institute of Early American History and Culture.) The book has good qualities: it is
                    objective, comprehensive, and is based on scholarly examination of the sources. These are all to its
                    credit, but why a prize? The book does not substantially change our understanding of Ames (assuming
                    one has read more than Parrington), nor is the presentation distinctive. If it is representative of
                    the kind of work that informed historical opinion generally considers worthy of a prize, historians
                    may be sliding down into a mire of their own making. It may be that they, like the Federalists, have
                    become men alienated from all save their own brethren.</p>

            <p>Until recently most historians confined their accounts of the Negro and slavery to the southern
                    colonies and states, leaving the impression that slavery in the North was an insignificant,
                    relatively mild institution. Scholars are now taking a closer look at involuntary servitude in the
                    North and are finding that it possessed many of the harsh, repressive characteristics heretofore
                    regarded as peculiarly southern. In this work McManus places special emphasis on the urban slave,
                    tracing the development of slavery from its introduction in early New <pb n="362" id="VAA4025-062-4-090"/> Netherland to its final abolition by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state legislature in 1841. Under Dutch rule slavery had been essentially a private
                    institution, with slaves permitted considerable personal freedom. But when the English obtained the
                    colony, they imposed rigid slave controls, creating a separate legal code and judicial system for
                    slaves.</p>
            <p>The author emphasizes the diversity of slave labor in colonial <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, where a shortage of free labor quickly created a demand for slave artisans. These
                    talented, ambitious Negroes played a significant role in the struggle for emancipation, with many
                    bondsmen eventually negotiating their own freedom. Paradoxically, the nature of the work performed
                    by slave craftsmen placed them in direct competition with white workers, a condition leading to
                    bitterness, hostility, and periodic violence on a scale unmatched in other colonies.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest is the account of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York City</settlement>
                    </placeName> slave conspiracies of 1712 and 1741, the latter paralleling in many respects the

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> witch trials. The outrageous accusations of Mary Burton, an indentured servant, threw
                    the city's inhabitants into panic; and before the hysteria subsided fourteen slaves had
                    been burned at the stake, eighteen hanged, and seventy-two deported from the province. In the
                    author's opinion these conspiracy trials were "judicial murders" (p.

                    </placeName>, McManus contends that although some of those leading the fight against slavery were
                    motivated by idealistic considerations, the institution was outlawed only after it had ceased to be
                    profitable. It was not until 1799 that the state legislature passed a law providing for gradual
                    emancipation, and slavery continued to exist in the state for nearly a half century thereafter.
                    Unfortunately emancipation did not bring equality; for while many New Yorkers opposed slavery, few
                    were willing to grant the freed Negro political freedom or equal economic opportunity.</p>
            <p>McManus has done little to fit slavery in <placeName>

                    </placeName> into the context of northern slavery as a whole. When he does employ analogy or
                    comparison, it is usually to show that a particularly harsh slave practice in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> compared favorably with similar practices in the South (p. 93). More
                    meaningful—though less flattering—would be comparison with the neighboring
                    state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, where the lot of the slave was generally better. Too, the student of American history
                    would be interested in learning more about the antislavery activities of such nationally prominent
                    New Yorkers as Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, John Jay, and Aaron Burr. The author mentions these figures but does not dwell on
                    their contributions in detail.</p>
            <p>Although McManus adequately explores the concept of slavery, he has little to say about slaves as
                    individuals. Aware of this shortcoming, the author states in his preface that such information is
                    simply not available (p. x). While the slaves themselves may not have left personal records, enough
                    is known about certain prominent <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> slaves to merit their inclusion. Consideration of the activities of these individuals
                    would not only add to the reader's interest, it would also help document the
                    author's assertion that Negroes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> generally were more intelligent, ambitious, and independent than their southern
                    counterparts.</p>

            <p>Neale's principal objective is "to examine the realities of the relationship
                    between British diplomacy and American imperialism during and immediately after the Spanish-American
                    War" (p. v). He contends that British policy at that time was less important in bringing
                    about an Anglo-American rapprochement than has been believed. Like other students of relations
                    between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he recognizes the strength of British sympathy for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, but he thinks that historians have failed to distinguish adequately between
                    expressions of good will by powerful newspapers and a few statesmen and the actual policies of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salisbury</settlement>
                    </placeName> cabinet. Neale attributes this failure to the rules of the Public Record Office which
                    long closed the pertinent British documents to research. Several scholars have made much use of
                    these materials since they were opened a few years ago, but Neale is the first to attempt a thorough
                    analysis of documents relating to his particular interest. He has also given careful scrutiny to the
                    private papers of Lord <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salisbury</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Sir Thomas Sanderson, and Lord Landsdowne. The result is convincing evidence that
                    American opinion in 1898 and some of the first historians of that year's decisive events
                    exaggerated the pro-American character of British policy.</p>
            <p>Although British policy was careful not to offend the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, it was also considerate of Spanish sensibilities. In fact the British ambassador in
                    Madrid, Sir Henry Drummond Wolfe, was so sympathetic with the Queen Regent of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> that at times he may have failed to represent his superiors' views accurately.
                    Of interest, too, are the activities of the British ambassador in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Sir Julian Pauncefote. That diplomat had earnestly promoted Anglo-American friendship,
                    and he enjoyed real popularity in America. He was, however, distressed by the belligerent policies
                    of the McKinley administration and worked to prevent war. His actions went beyond the desires of the
                    British government, but not so far as some of his critics charged late in his career. The policies
                    of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> cabinet were, then, essentially policies of a correct, cautious neutrality.</p>
            <p>Neale also discusses Anglo-American relations immediately after the war. He finds that there were
                    still many difficulties between the two governments and that on occasion the traditional American
                    hostility towards Great Britain reappeared. He concludes that there is little reason to believe that
                    the enthusiasm Englishmen and Americans had frequently expressed for each other in 1898 had markedly
                    changed what he calls "the quality of Anglo-American co-operation" (p. xiii).</p>
            <p>Had this book appeared a generation ago its interpretations would have been considered quite
                    original, perhaps controversial; but they have been anticipated in distinguished books published in
                    recent years by Charles S. Campbell, Jr., and Ernest R. May. For yet other reasons it may not
                    receive the attention it deserves. There are too many obscure passages and too many unnecessary
                    repetitions. On occasion there are troubling minor errors. More careful editing could have resulted
                    in a better book, but this work does, nevertheless, add substantially to the knowledge of
                    Anglo-American relations at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

                    its physical landscape, portray its counties and towns, view both its rural and urban life, feature
                    its state parks and forests, and related items. The Forward describes this as the initial atlas of

                    is a "comprehensive and detailed index" to the microfilm collection and archives
                    of the Lutheran Church in America, the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The large quantity of available material is suggested by the fact that
                    "almost a hundred thousand feet of microfilm have been accumulated" and the
                    Church's library holdings include "upwards of thirty-eight thousand volumes of
                    books, periodicals, pamphlets and tracts, a manuscript and archives collection in excess of two
                    million documents and papers, and a museum and photographic collection consisting of thousands of
                    items." This index affords useful clues to many facets of American history and of course
                    suggests a mine of primary source material about Lutheranism in the <placeName>

                    place and name index are included which should be useful to genealogists. Only one Indiana resident
                    is listed in the place index (p. 111).</p>

                    1960. The generally favorable reviews which it received by historical scholars are ample evidence of
                    the wisdom of reprinting it in the Bison paperback series to make it available to additional
                    readers. As indicated by the title, Glad concentrates on Bryan's influence and achievements
                    during the period 1896–1912 when "The Commoner" was thrice the
