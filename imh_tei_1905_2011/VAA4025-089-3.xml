                    </placeName>. Although mine has tended to be the view of an outsider looking in, Indiana has always
                    struck me as a distinctive place if only in its landscapes. Take, for example, what the watchful
                    motorist can see upon entering Indiana from the north or the east. On the secondary, or
                    "blue highways," rights-of-way tend to be narrower in Indiana, the roads not
                    over-engineered with the wide sweeping curves and the monotonously level straightaways of Michigan
                    and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In Indiana highways seem to fit more readily into the passing scene. Signs crowd the
                    roads as do fences and, frequently, houses and other buildings (Figures 1 and 2).</p>
            <p>Except when seen from the freeways the Indiana countryside seems to be resisting modernism. There is
                    a kinship with the past evident in the smaller scale of things, even new things, pushed close to
                    Indiana roads. Could such differences be symptomatic of things profound? What might they mean to
                    students of Indiana's past? To me they have always suggested at the very least that Indiana
                    may be more like Kentucky than its other neighbors. Could this be true? If so, is it important?
                    Surely the state's settlement history must reflect vividly in its contemporary landscapes.
                    Or is that conclusion merely the wishful thinking of a geographer overly anxious to see contemporary
                    landscapes as a kind of archive capable of exposing the past to view?</p>
            <pb n="[178]" id="VAA4025-089-3-008"/>
            <figure>
               <p>Fig. 1. Fences and signs closely line many Indiana highways, helping to define for the state a
                        "sense of place" rooted as much in past as in contemporary technologies.</p>

            <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-089-3-009"/>
            <p>One can see subtle differences as well in Indiana's small towns. Highways tend to crunch
                    through the centers of Indiana places, often right down Main Street. Unlike <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana has not been so preoccupied with bypasses, both those that skirt downtowns and
                    those that skirt towns altogether. In Illinois one has to make an effort to get to the center of
                    things, but in Indiana one is deposited there as a matter of course. Only around the major cities,
                    and usually only on the freeways, can travelers practice urban avoidance in the Hoosier state. I
                    think that in Indiana there is a definite temporal rhythm to travel, a rhythm often readily
                    noticeable in the configuration of the roads themselves. Across the center of the state U. S. 40
                    expands and contracts its width at the closely spaced towns, places originally positioned to serve
                    the wagon traffic of the old National Road (Figure 3). What might this mean? Should we care?</p>
            <figure>
               <p>Fig. 3. U. S. 40 constricts at the center of Lewistown, the narrow hilltop Main Street visible
                        for miles when approaching from both east and west.</p>
            </figure>
            <p>The conservative influences in Indiana that minimize expenditures on public rights-of-way seemingly
                    sustain as well minimum interference in the use of adjacent private property. A tradition of weak
                    land use control through zoning and other devices has produced in Indiana towns and cities profound
                    temporal juxtapositions. From the most recent convenience store, car wash, or drive-in bank, one can
                    trace back decade by decade the history of a town at a single glance. Mixed in and showing through
                    the more recent layers of built environment at town centers are automobile showrooms relic from the
                    1950s, chain stores from the 1920s, lodge halls and opera houses from the 1870s, and, often, a
                    tavern or a hotel <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-089-3-010"/> from before the Civil War. As Hoosier Scott
                    Russell Sanders (1989, p. 5) notes, Indiana is "a hodgepodge of contradictory
                    visions."</p>
            <p>Indiana towns display time depth not because they have been fossilized as museums at some distant
                    time (of course, the state does have its share of such places) but because changes manifested over
                    the decades stand vividly portrayed in the juxtapositioning of diverse things, each surviving from a
                    different warp in time. Indiana towns seem to share a subtle style of weaving together such fabrics.
                    Pastness in landscape is a visible accumulation of overlapping traces from successive periods, each
                    trace modifying and modified to form a collage of no single period (Jakle and Wilson, 1992, p. 15).
                    What remains are varying design vocabularies, each reflecting off the others to give a sense of
                    cumulative temporal depth.</p>
            <p>Indiana's landscapes thus tend to invite careful reading. The state's built
                    environments are, by and large, rich texts. What probably should excite historians most, of course,
                    are the places where encrustations of the state's earliest decades persist relatively
                    little influenced by more contemporary development (as in the older portion of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>) or, additionally, where they are deliberately contrived to be
                    "historic" (as at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>). These are the obvious places where "history" is in the process of
                    being spared the ravages of modernization (or, at least, the intrusiveness of many modern things) or
                    where pastness is being overtly contrived. Change in these places involves strong "rearview
                    mirror vision" (Figure 4). Old horizons are being rejuvenated and given extended <figure>
                  <p>Fig. 4. <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                            reminiscent of early and mid-nineteenth-century origins. Here are built environments
                            quintessentially "historical."</p>
               </figure>
                    <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-089-3-011"/> life. A new horizon is being configured to complement the old
                    by strongly suggesting pastness. Where historic preservation thrives, people have learned to read
                    their landscapes for intrinsic values, aesthetic and otherwise. Discovery has been followed by
                    investment, perhaps the most meaningful form of historical landscape affirmation in American
                    society.</p>
            <p>Why have the historians of Indiana proven so little interested in reading the state's built
                    environments? Why is there so little emphasis on landscape as a kind of text? Can students of
                    Indiana history not see the landscape as a depository of historical facts, a kind of archive to be
                    tapped? Why are they not more sensitive to the symbolisms of material culture? The built environment
                    results from human enterprise. Once formed, however, the built environment influences subsequent
                    enterprise. It is a social production that helps engender further production in continuing rounds of
                    symbiotic relationship. Why have Indiana historians been slow to grasp this basic organizing fact?
                    Of course, there are some who have accepted the challenge. Thomas J. Schlereth (1985) in celebrating
                    Indiana's U. S. 40, for example, has laid a savvy base from which to engender comprehension
                    of Indiana's landscapes generally. But can many others be brought on board? That certainly
                    is my objective here.</p>
            <p>I offer in this essay focus on the concept of landscape, specifically those aspects of landscape that
                    I call the built environment. Landscape is an idea useful in tying human events to the realities of
                    place. This is a lesson learned relatively recently by historical and cultural geographers, and it
                    is the viewpoint that I would pass along to students of Indiana history as they grapple with the
                    essence of their state as geographical context. What follows is a brief assessment of how historians
                    traditionally have viewed geography and a brief outline of human geography's growth as a
                    discipline, emphasizing historical and cultural geography as sub-disciplines increasingly formed
                    around the study of landscapes. Finally, through an explicit review of the literature, embracing the
                    works of both historians and geographers, I outline the makings of a geographical history focused on
                    Indiana.</p>
            <p rend="center">GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY</p>
            <p>Most historians are quick to say how important geography is to the study of history. By this
                    endorsement they generally refer to physical geography or natural environment viewed as neutral
                    context. "Geography is the stage upon which history is acted," many historians
                    affirm. Such is the old truism. But few historians seem to recognize that messages are embedded in
                    the stage by human action and that those messages, hardly neutral at all, serve to influence
                    subsequent action. Props invested with strong meanings carry much of the play's
                    communication. Theater is made in <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-089-3-012"/> telligible not only by the
                    spoken lines and the body language of the actors but as well by the spatial structuring of the stage
                    set—by the sense of place created on stage. It is, therefore, not physical geography but
                    human geography that should count the most—the human geography of strong social meanings
                    manifested as the material culture of built environment.</p>
            <p>Can the history of Indiana be fully written without concern for the diversity of its
                    places—the places variously defined at different geographical scales that have comprised
                    the Indiana experience? Can the story be fully told without focus on the processes that created
                    specific kinds of places as generic habitats? Can historians ignore specific localities? How was it
                    to confront wilderness in the creation of a farm? How was it to spare wilder places in arresting
                    farm, town, and city development in the creation of state parks and forests? How was it to live in a
                    time of thriving small towns? How was it to experience the collapse of a once viable city
                    neighborhood? Progress and failure, the stuff of historical change, has played out in real places in
                    Indiana with names like Pigeon Roost, Conner <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>, <country reg="tu">Turkey</country>
               </placeName> Run, Gas City,
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>, <region type="county">Fountain</region>
               </placeName> Square.</p>
            <p>Too many historians have a tendency to conceptualize "history" as something a
                    spatially suspended. History is reified as courses of events or as trajectories of occurrence devoid
                    of geographical anchoring. It is a story told largely in terms of personalities and institutions
                    divorced from the realities of place. Thus Indiana history—the history of events of the
                    state—is removed intellectually from the underpinnings of location and the myriad
                    relationships that hinge on locational context. What did the physical isolation of a region or a
                    city neighborhood mean in the politics of an era? How did a town's ability to compete in
                    Indiana's evolving system of railroad connectivity (or highway connectivity) drive some
                    political agendas forward and retard others? How were key personalities formed by the circumstances
                    of spatial proximity to (or spatial isolation from) significant others in the places where decisions
                    were made? These are the sorts of questions that are too often overlooked in the neglect of the
                    geographical dimension.</p>
            <p>When geography is embraced by scholars, it is too often viewed as an explaining variable in a
                    simplistic deterministic sense. Proximity may be hypothesized as explaining political influence, but
                    proximity is never the lone factor to drive influence in political networks. It is a modifying or
                    modified variable in its conjunction with other variables. Geographical factors are inherently
                    enabling rather than directly causal. A state's circulation system provides a framework for
                    action, but actions vary according to individual and group competencies at overcoming the frictions
                    of distance and at gaining accessibility to places (and people) of influence. Isolation may invite
                    certain kinds of perceptions important in modifying behavior, <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-089-3-013"/>
                    but isolation, among other geographical variables, cannot determine human activity. Geography
                    influences according to the cultural values, the social, political, and economic competencies, and
                    the technical skills of people.</p>
            <p>Historians tend not to consider geographical variables as worthy of explanation. They do not take
                    geography as a thing in and of itself worthy of explanation. Such is fully reasonable, for if
                    historians take geography as intellectually compelling ahead of history (or the study of historical
                    change), they become geographers. Seeing the environment's spatial aspects as something to
                    be explained, rather than as something offering explanation, is the preoccupation of academic
                    geography. Advocated here, however, is a blending of the geographical and historical
                    viewpoints—the historian's concern with pattern or changing pattern over time
                    and the geographer's concern with pattern or changing pattern over space. Advocated here is
                    a historical geography or geographical history that blends the two viewpoints without the one
                    totally subverting the other.</p>
            <p>Historians have not been alone in neglecting the geographical underpinnings of human life. According
                    to certain social theorists, historical explanation has traditionally dominated both the humanities
                    and the social sciences to the near exclusion of spatial or geographical viewpoints (Soja, 1989).
                    Explanations sought have been linear. Emphasis has been on change, the seeking of cause and effect
                    relationships across linear chronologies of perceived occurrence. Explanations have not been
                    lateral, the seeking of explanatory relationships in surrounding contexts. Explanations tend not to
                    mix the linear or the historical with the lateral or the geographical. Such was the power of
                    modernist science bootlegged into the study of the human experience in the late nineteenth and early
                    twentieth centuries. In today's postmodernist era such simplified explanatory stances have
                    fallen out of fashion if only temporarily. Diversity of approach has come to the forefront. The need
                    to place human behavior carefully in spatial context as well as to seek historical explanation is
                    now recognized.</p>

            <p>The study of geography is, itself, both old and new. Introduced in the early nineteenth century in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was an encyclopedic version of geography that emphasized place locations and offered
                    descriptions of their physical and economic characteristics among other facts. School children were
                    asked: What is the capital of Indiana? What are the state's principal rivers? What are its
                    principal crops and where are they grown? Produced were gazetteers and atlases but few major
                    theoretical treatises around which a substantive discipline could be based. Important ideas that did
                    surface tended to be ignored as, for example, George Perkins <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-089-3-014"/>
                    Marsh's concern with the human wasting of natural resources (Lowenthal, 1958). Geography
                    was thus dropped from the curriculum at many major colleges and universities to be reintroduced in
                    the early twentieth century first as the study of landforms. Before separate geography departments
                    were formed, geography tended to be nurtured in geology departments with the concern for
                    geomorphology or the study of landform formation preeminent. New questions were asked, now of
                    college students. How were river valleys formed? Along the banks of Indiana's <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, for example, what were the mechanics of bluff erosion, terrace formation, river
                    meander?</p>
            <p>Human geography initially emerged as the study of environmental influences on humankind, an extension
                    of the study of the physical environment itself. A blatant environmental determinism temporarily
                    dominated whereby human behavior was seen to be regulated by environment. The first distinctly
                    "historical geography" emerged in this context driven by such luminaries as
                    Ellsworth <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName> (1907) and Ellen Churchill Semple (1903 and 1911). They saw such factors as climatic
                    change or the physical isolation of mountain landscapes as determining the courses of human action.
                    This was a brand of geographical scholarship that some leading historians championed. For example,
                    Frederick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Turner (1894 and 1914) in examining the impact of the western frontier on American
                    society and politics bootlegged "environmental influences" into both his frontier
                    thesis and his examination of sectionalism. This orientation informed substantially the work of John
                    D. Barnhart, a historian focused on the frontier's liberalizing influences on Indiana and
                    other state governments in the Old Northwest (and with whom I had the privilege of studying history
                    while a graduate student at Indiana University).</p>
            <p>Data available from census and other sources engendered in the 1920s another kind of human geography
                    focused on the functional organization of geographical space. There emerged a strong reliance on
                    regionalization, a preoccupation perhaps analogous to the historian's embracing of
                    periodization (Jakle, 1971). Regional geography, which sought to understand the world according to
                    regional differences and similarities, produced descriptive narratives supported by the use of
                    descriptive statistics. How might Indiana be divided into regions? What distinguished southern
                    Indiana from other parts of the state in farming, in manufacturing, in religious preference, in
                    demographic characteristics? The 1960s brought use of inferential statistical analysis and
                    mathematical modeling oriented to theory building (Johnston, 1983). How might the size and
                    distribution of Indiana's cities be explained as a system? How could regularities be
                    mathematically described? What was the influence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the state's system of "central places"? And how did <placeName>

                    </placeName>? Most human <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-089-3-015"/> geographers naively assumed the stance
                    of the social scientist. Only historical geographers and cultural geographers tended to decline the
                    social science invitation in their continued orientation to the humanities.</p>
            <p>Deductive modeling in economic geography sought strong predictive capabilities. Assumptions about
                    human rationality were built into models to explain, using aggregated data, location decisions
                    relative to retail stores, factories, and other sorts of businesses. For example, it was assumed
                    that decision makers always operated from full information, thus sought to minimize costs and
                    maximize profits. It was as if Indiana farmers always sought to grow the most profitable crops on
                    the basis of complete if not perfect market information or that Indiana industrialists, always
                    sought the optimal locations where labor, land, transport, and other costs were completely
                    minimized. A kind of economic determinism came to the fore whereby "economic man"
                    deliberately rendered a fully rational world measured largely in dollars and cents. Whole categories
                    of human experience were ignored for no other reason than the impossibility of quantitatively
                    measuring variables and introducing them into theoretical constructs. Synthesizing treatments of
                    human behavior and study of derived landscape consequences continued to fall to historical and
                    cultural geographers who remained largely unwed to scientism.</p>
            <p rend="center">HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY</p>
            <p>Historical geography reemerged in the 1930s primarily as the study of regions changing over time
                    (see: Norton, 1984). Its advocates saw in its practice the posing of the great questions of academic
                    history in geographical context (Clark, 1954). Whereas historical geography was intended to reach
                    out to history, cultural geography was intended to reach out to anthropology, and the concept of
                    culture became its organizing idea. Culture was seen to manifest itself in the built environment as
                    "material culture." The landscape, in other words, was seen to reflect culture as
                    "cultural landscape." Culture regions could be defined according to the ways in
                    which significant culture traits, tangible and intangible, proved mappable. Historical geography and
                    cultural geography developed a strong affinity for one another. Explanation in both was usually
                    based on historical analysis. Both were preoccupied with geographical change. Historical narrative
                    was the primary media of communication.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, a kind of cultural determinism was brought to the fore in cultural geography. Culture,
                    as a kind of superorganic, could not really be defined nor, accordingly, effectively measured
                    (Duncan, 1980). Cultural geographers, however, were not deterred from adopting deterministic stances
                    relative to explanations rendered. Things that reflected "culture" in landscape
                    were assumed <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-089-3-016"/> to be explained by the reflection—to
                    stand as culture's surrrogates. The temple-front Greek Revival houses of northern Indiana
                    spoke of a Yankee culture area extended westward from upstate <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and Ohio carrying clear value implications rooted in religion and education. The
                    Georgian-plan houses of the Quakers and other settlers from the Middle States across central Indiana
                    told other stories as did the so-called "1-houses" built by Kentuckians and
                    Virginians throughout southern Indiana (Figure 5). Culture was <figure>
                  <p>Fig. 5. An "I-house" east of <placeName>

                            social status, especially in southern Indiana.</p>
               </figure> seen to determine differences and similarities that were observed from place to place. One
                    might conclude that determinism, whether environmental, economic, or cultural, seemed to develop
                    whenever simple cause and effect relationships were sought.</p>
            <p>Two philosophical stances loom today as organizing frameworks sustaining contemporary human
                    geography—orientations that can potentially overcome deterministic fallacies and, at the
                    same time, foster both rigorous modeling and descriptive synthesis. They are structuration theory
                    and symbolic interaction theory. It is my belief that historical and cultural geography in the
                    future will rely heavily on both, or on variations of the two intertwined.</p>
            <p>Structuration theory posits that human behavior can only be understood by looking both at individual
                    actors and at the social structures through which individuals drive action (Giddens, 1984). There is
                    no vague cultural determinism here. Geographical decision making, for example, is seen to reflect
                    both individual prerog- <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-089-3-017"/> atives in accessing options and making
                    locational choices and the institutional contexts through which these options are defined,
                    evaluated, and acted upon. There was a spatial logic that drove the locating of steel mills in what
                    quickly became the city of Gary. It had to do with the costs of assembling raw materials and
                    distributing product as well as the costs of securing capital and labor. But there was nothing
                    impelling about it. It was not a "natural" process of development. Rather, it
                    resulted from specific decision makers operating within specific institutions—for
                    example, Judge Elbert H. Gary within the U. S. Steel Corporation and that corporation's
                    dominance of the American steel market.</p>
            <p>Culture enters as the value sets that enable institutions to function. Cultural landscape, in turn,
                    is seen both to reflect past decision making and to be part of the context influencing present
                    decision making. It is both a social construction and molder of future constructions. The concept of
                    place comes to the fore in that all human behavior is place oriented or place contained. Place
                    construction and the use of places is integral to society's structuring and functioning.
                    That the USX Corporation has an extensive steel mill at Gary with a particular technology mix lodged
                    in a specific productive network of facilities constitutes a profound institutional fact. How
                    corporate managers drive the company's future development will substantially reflect
                    existing corporate geography.</p>
            <p>Symbolic interactionism posits that society is the sum total of all interactions. Emphasis is placed
                    on the process of communication whereby social realities are negotiated (Strauss, 1964). Important
                    for students of landscape, of course, is the idea that the built environment contains messages that
                    serve to direct or channel human behaviors. These messages help define places as appropriate
                    contexts for action. Expectations develop as regards place appropriateness based, in part, on the
                    kinds of messages embedded in the environment. Historical analysis, therefore, turns to
                    understanding how place meanings have attached to landscapes in the defining of meaningful contexts
                    for action. Historical geographical analysis turns to understanding changing place meanings over
                    time (Jakle, 1990).</p>

                    substantially the economic focus as well (Figure 6). But the city's new downtown geography
                    of convention and conference centers, of sports arenas, and of shopping malls speaks of wide-ranging
                    symbolism—of life styles rooted in leisure time consumption (Figure 7). Who created this
                    geography—this symbolism of place? Who consumes it? How is the dialectic between
                    production and consumption driven? Why do old warehouses restored and horse-drawn carriages
                    reintroduced on downtown streets figure so prominently? What is the history of this communication

            <p>There are, perhaps, two brands of historical geography today. One, sometimes called historical
                    cultural geography, is built around the study of changing cultural landscapes. That is the brand
                    that I emphasize here. The other is linked directly to the scholarship of economic historians.
                    Formed around the work of Andrew H. Clark and many of his students at the University of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, this latter emphasis seeks to contribute to discussions ongoing in history, primarily
                    economic history. Clark and his students have explored for selected time periods and regions the
                    issue of Europe Overseas—in other words, the transfer of capitalistic economy, its
                    related values, and its technologies in the settling of North America (see: Gibson, 1978). Clark
                    brought a certain rigor to historical geographical research, instilling in his students strong <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-089-3-019"/>

                    Clark's proteges have gone on to rely heavily on field observation in the study of
                    landscape.</p>
            <p>The word "landscape," which dates back to the seventeenth century, originally
                    referred to scenes painted by artists (for elaboration see: Cosgrove, 1984, p. 16; Jakle, 1987).
                    Slowly the word's meaning began to change to include that which might be seen when looking
                    out across an actual expanse of territory. Society's elites, especially in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, began to compete in creating "landscapes" contrived to look like
                    paintings. Compositional devices were developed to render park-like, pastoral scenes that spoke of
                    affluence, power, and prestige. In the late twentieth century the term landscape has come to refer
                    to the actual material structuring of place. A landscape, in this sense, serves as a container
                    structured both by natural processes (natural landscape) and by social forces (cultural landscape).</p>

            <p>Today the name John B. Jackson (1980, 1984) is closely associated with the study of landscape (see:
                    Meinig, 1979a) although it was from the geographer Carl 0. Sauer, and such essays as his
                    "The Morphology of Landscape" (19251, that many of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s ideas originated. In establishing in the 1950s the influential magazine <hi rend="i">Landscape</hi>, which he dedicated to interpreting built environments, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> took as his guiding principle the idea that landscapes were to be read and evaluated
                    according to function. He deliberately deemphasized the visual and, as a corollary, the
                    landscape's aesthetic aspects. It is the cultural landscape taken as a structured container
                    for human activity that counts. The landscape concept has given human geographers a tangible subject
                    matter upon which to focus inquiry. Human geography no longer remains solely the study of regions or
                    locational decision making or human spatial organizations—all abstract
                    ideas—but is, additionally, the study of humankind's landscape surroundings as

                    literature might contain. I organize my thoughts under the following labels: (1) physical or natural
                    environment, (2) cultural values in environmental cognition, (3) migration, cultural diffusion, and
                    the settling process, (4) social organization and place, and (5) material culture and evolving built
                    environment. All of these emphases inform the landscape idea. They are not mutually exclusive,
                    merely convenient categories for assessing what is a large and diverse literature. I will also
                    recommend major works that offer syntheses of several of these major historical-geographical themes.
                    I do not pretend a complete coverage in my selection of examples. I intend only to be suggestive.</p>
            <p rend="center">Physical or Natural Environment</p>
            <p>Human life is restricted primarily to the surface of the planet earth. Human history is essentially
                    enveloped there. Every aspect of the planet's physical being, including its human
                    population, is integrally linked ecologically. In its most essential aspect history is the story of
                    humankind's coming to grips with its environment. <hi rend="i">Homo sapiens</hi> first
                    emerged as an environmentally specialized organism ultimately dominating larger and larger
                    ecological niches through the embracing of increasingly sophisticated technologies and modes of
                    social organization. That the first Europeans to in- <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-089-3-021"/> trude upon
                    what would ultimately become Indiana possessed advanced technologies (for example, a grain- and
                    animal-based agriculture) as well as advanced social institutions (for example, a market economy
                    organized on capitalistic principles) does not negate the need to consider the physical or natural
                    environment as inherently enabling and/or restricting. True, the Europeans were more
                    "sophisticated in their cultural baggage than Native Americans (and thus not as
                    "close to nature"), but physical environment still remained something very much to
                    be accommodated. The environment presented resistances to be overcome with some locations and some
                    areas better endowed naturally for one or another sort of intended change. Differences in landform,
                    drainage, vegetation, soil, and climate informed human successes and failures place to place over
                    time. Where then would a historian turn to comprehend the outlines of natural or physical
                    environment?</p>

                    biogeography. For soils one might start with Francis D. Hole's and James B.
                    Campbell's <hi rend="i">Soil Landscape Analysis</hi> (1985). May T. Watts's <hi rend="i">Reading the Landscape: An Adventure in Ecology</hi> (1957) is an excellent guide to
                    interpreting nature in landscape. Armed with these overviews the historian should possess the
                    rudiments with which to pursue questions of environmental "influence."</p>
            <p>Comprehension of basic physical geography can only inform understanding of changing human response.
                    How might an impermeable claypan in a soil have retarded grain cultivation at a specific time and
                    place? How might such conditions have impacted the viability of farm trade centers in an area? How
                    might topography have informed route selection and hence road networking? How might route selection
                    have warped the urban network favoring some locations over others? Although would-be geographical
                    historians should necessarily look beyond the physical environment in studying urban patterns, they,
                    nonetheless, should anchor questions on comprehensions rooted there.</p>
            <p rend="center">Cultural Values and Environmental Cognition</p>
            <p>More important than understanding past physical environment per se is comprehending how historical
                    actors or agents of <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-089-3-022"/> change actually conceptualized those
                    environments. It is not the world as it was so much as the world as it was thought to have been.
                    What were the beliefs, attitudes, and intentionalities that underlay nature's assessment?
                    What were the behavioral proclivities brought by various kinds of people to nature's
                    modification? Conceptualizing nature, of course, is but a subset of a larger concern. How do people
                    conceptualize their total surroundings as geography? How do these conceptions influence behavior?
                    Once nature has been modified—a wilderness exploited, the land cultivated, towns and
                    cities sustained commercially, political territories established—then the environment is
                    substantially a social construct. As physical manifestation it stands as cultural rather than as
                    natural landscape. How then are cultural landscapes assessed? Specifically, how are places assigned
                    meanings, and how do these meanings change over time?</p>
            <p>Places are loci of meaning. <placeName>

                    </placeName>, I have suggested, is not only a physical place—a container of human
                    activities—but it is a symbolic thing suggesting and thus inviting human intentionality.
                    Behavioral expectations, negotiated in the continuous rounds of symbolic interaction (Denzin, 19921,
                    attach to places. As I have said, society in this view stands as the sum total of all
                    communications—from the highly personalized face-to-face messages at one end of the
                    communication spectrum to highly impersonal "to whom it may concern" messages
                    embedded in the fabric of the built environment. Social reality is constantly renegotiated through
                    interaction. Places take meaning at various spatial scales, from that of personal spaces enveloping
                    closely the individual to the spaces of rooms and whole buildings as architecture to that which is
                    more recognizably "geographical" as defined at neighborhood, district, or regional
                    levels. Researchers in behavioral geography and environmental psychology among other disciplines
                    have produced an extensive literature given to environmental cognition. Excellent syntheses have
                    been written by Irwin Altman (1975) and Thomas F. Saarinen (1984).</p>
            <p>The historian might be better oriented to environmental cognition through works focused directly on
                    cultural values. John K. Wright's <hi rend="i">Human Nature in Geography</hi> (1966), a
                    seminal philosophical statement, and David Lowenthal's and Martyn J. Bowden's
                    edited <hi rend="i">festschrift</hi> in Wright's honor (1976) are highly recommended.
                    Clearly reflective of the closure between values and landscape are works by historians including
                    William Cronon's <hi rend="i">Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of

                        Pastoral Ideal in America</hi> (1964). Focus on the symbolism of place plays out in such diverse
                    but related works as Henry Nash Smith's <hi rend="i">Virgin Land: The American West as
                        Symbol and Myth</hi> (1950) and <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-089-3-023"/> Annette Kolodny's

                        Letters</hi> (1975). How do different kinds of people assess places of different sorts
                    differently? How does it all translate into changing landscape? A concise outline of this
                    intellectual challenge appears as "The Beholding Eye: Ten Versions of the Same
                    Scene" by Donald W. Meinig in his edited volume <hi rend="i">The Interpretation of Ordinary

            <p rend="center">Migration, Cultural Diffusion, and the Settling Processes</p>
            <p>As regards Indiana landscapes, perhaps the most important historical period was that of initial
                    effective American settlement. Political, economic, and social templates were cast that would drive
                    and substantially mold subsequent development. Systems of land survey, land sales, and land tenure
                    along with systems of political jurisdiction and market regulation were introduced, all of which
                    would give substantive form to the built environment. People attracted variously from the south and
                    east (and directly from Europe as well) would impose varying cultural templates (Figure 8). Much of
                    the initial impress of field patterns, road and streets, and other residuals reflecting early
                    property division can still be seen in most contemporary Indiana landscapes for subsequent overlays
                    and modifications have all been made on the base levels of initial settlement.</p>
            <p>Historians have had a penchant for focusing on pioneering through the search for cultural origins.

                    transition from a subsistence agricultural economy highly dependent upon the hunt toward a
                    commercial corn and hog agriculture reinforced by railroads and market towns. Michael J.
                    OBrien's <hi rend="i">Grassland, Forest, and Historical Settlement</hi> (1984) is more
                    decidedly geographical in that he carefully traces the changing spatial organization of a Missouri
                    frontier community, detailing initial settlement and subsequent settlement maturation as a
                    reflection, in part, of soil, slope, drainage, and vegetation differences. A migration stream is
                    carefully documented back to Kentucky with emphasis placed on the cultural values and technologies

                    </placeName>. How did early settlers appraise the physical environment? How did this appraisal
                    inform land claims and early patterns of settlement distribution? How did success and failure on the
                    land, in part a function of choices made, influence material culture? The work of Wayne E. Keifer

                        <region type="county">Rush County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is of a similar vein.</p>
            <p>For Indiana there has been a long standing interest in migration and cultural diffusion resulting in
                    the mapping of population dispersals across the state over time. Richard L. Power's <hi rend="i">Planting Corn Belt Culture</hi> (1953) has been followed recently by a spate of
                    articles by historians and geographers: James M. Bergquist (1981) and Gregory S. Rose (1985, 1986,
                    and 1991). Folklorists, geographers, and other scholars have begun to sketch the outlines of
                    nineteenth-century material culture residual from these different culture groups (southerners versus
                    Yankees for example): Warren Roberts (1984) with log architecture, Robert W. Bastian (1975) with
                    common houses, and John Fraser Hart (1968) with field patterns. An introduction to the analysis of
                    material culture at the landscape scale may be had in Thomas J. Schlereth's <hi rend="i">Cultural History and Material Culture: Everyday Life and Material Culture</hi> (1992). The
                    classic statement tying vernacular architecture to cultural diffusion remains Fred
                    Kniffen's "Folk Housing: Key to Diffusion" (1965).</p>

               </figure> Places defined at various scales link, often hierarchically, in highly patterned ways. The
                    historian moving to embrace place-oriented explanation would do well to investigate the literature
                    on human territoriality; for example, Robert D. Sack's <hi rend="i">Human Territoriality:
                        Its Theory and History</hi> (1986) and E. Gordon Ericksen's <hi rend="i">The

                    (1977). For an excellent anthology which brings together recent work focused on place-oriented

            <p>Historians as well as geographers have long been concerned with the region (or section) as a kind of
                    place (see Turner, 1932, and Jensen, 1951). How have political tensions rooted in different cultural
                    values emerged through different economic orientations? Geographers have asked a wide variety of
                    related questions. Wilbur Zelinsky in his <hi rend="i">The Cultural Geography of the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    hand, looks at the history of the Middle West as an idea in his <hi rend="i">Middle West: Its
                        Meaning in American Culture</hi> (1989). How and why have regions attracted people and
                    investment differentially? How has power been exercised vis-a-vis differing political proclivities
                    regionally defined? How has regionalism traditionally operated in a state like Indiana? The question
                    of how Indiana divides into perceptual regions or sections remains to be fully answered.</p>

                    conceptualized substantially around issues of society and place. Spatial distribution, spatial
                    organization, and the spatial behavior of people within and between places receives substantive
                    emphasis. How and why did immigrant populations cluster geographically? How did this influence
                    socialization? For Indiana the work of Dean R. Esslinger on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>

                    relation to social class and status, again in an Indiana context, see Robert W. Bastian's
                    "Architecture and Class Segregation in Late Nineteenth-Century <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana" (1975). James J. Duncan's "Landscape Taste as a
                    Symbol of Group Identity" (1973) remains a classic statement relating social class and
                    architectural tastes.</p>
            <p>The spatial organization of cities, and systems of cities as they relate to territorial hinterlands,
                    has generated substantial interest among geographers. Some of this work has been given important
                    historical orientation. Allan R. Pred's (1966, 1973, and 1980) focus on urban dynamics
                    applies various theoretical constructs to historic cases in both the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and Europe and establishes a comparative analytical framework in the process. How and
                    why has the modern system of cities evolved? David R. Meyer's "A Dynamic Model of
                    the Integration of Frontier Urban Places into the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> System of Cities" (1980) speaks directly to this question. Why have some urban
                    places thrived and others not in the competition for economic ascendancy? Michael P.
                    Conzen's "The Maturing Urban System in the <placeName>

                    answers. A broader consideration of growth/nongrowth factors appears in Edward K. Muller's
                    "Selective Urban Growth in the Middle Ohio Valley, 1800–1860" (1976).
                    The small town as a creature of territorial competition between railroad corporations is the topic

                    </placeName>, perhaps a more typical American city. How has the Hoosier capital's class

            <p>The research of certain urban geographers, urban sociologists, and urban planners who have focused on
                    the contemporary city should suggest to historians hypotheses deserving historical analysis. Neil
                    Smith, a geographer, formulates in his <hi rend="i">Uneven Development: Nature, Capital and the
                        Production of Space</hi> (1990) how certain inequalities of development are integral to modern
                    capitalism. Sociologists John R. Logan and Harvey L. Molotch in their <hi rend="i">Urban Fortunes:
                        The Political Economy of Place</hi> (1987) view the development of cities in terms of local
                    conflict over growth.</p>
            <p rend="center">Material Culture and Evolving Built Environment</p>
            <p>The common house is, perhaps, the most important feature of any landscape. A machine for living, the
                    house shelters; a social symbol, the house communicates class, status, and other meanings. In the
                    aggregate no other building type is 'so numerous. Peirce F. Lewis's
                    "Common Houses, Culture Spoor" (1975) provides concise introduction to the study
                    of American house types as does Allen G. Noble's book, <hi rend="i">Wood, Brick, and Stone:
                        The North American Settlement Landscape: Vol. 1: Houses</hi> (1984). Henry H. Glassie's

               </hi> (1968) focuses on folk buildings whereas Lewis and Noble embrace the
                    vernacular of the early commercial builders as well. Jakle, Bastian, and Meyer (1989) consider a
                    sample of small towns across the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName>, Indiana) to analyze both relic folk and builder houses and their plan form and style
                    influences on twentieth-century house construction. The social or cultural significance of the house
                    as home has been explored by social historians. Highly recommended is Gwendolyn Wright's
                        <hi rend="i">Moralism and the Model Home</hi> (1979) and Jan Cohn's <hi rend="i">The
                        Palace or the Poorhouse: The American House as a Cultural Symbol</hi> (1979).</p>
            <p>For rural landscapes and landscape features, one might start with John Fraser Hart's <hi rend="i">The Look of the Land</hi> (1975). Hart couples introductions to barns, fences, and the
                    other prevailing structures <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-089-3-029"/> of rural countryside to concern for
                    land division, land tenure, and farm economy among other topics. The book, as one reviewer noted,
                    might have as easily been called "How to Look at the Land." For an overview of
                    barns, see Volume 2 of Noble's <hi rend="i">Wood, Brick, and Stone</hi> (1984). Concern
                    with rural structures carries a certain urgency. With increased mechanization, specialization, and
                    consolidation in Indiana agriculture much of the state's traditional rural fabric is
                    directly threatened. As buildings are removed, Indiana faces a dwindling landscape archive from
                    which to read the past.</p>
            <p>As for urban examples, I will restrict my comments largely to the built environments of American
                    retailing. Architectural historian C#2 H. Liebs's <hi rend="i">Main Street to Miracle Mile:
                        American Roadside Architecture</hi> (1985) is one place to start for overview. Liebs traces the
                    rise of Main Street as a retail institution and its decline in favor of commercial strips. Richard
                    Longstreth, also an architectural historian, explores the building types of the typical American
                    Main Street in his <hi rend="i">The Buildings of Main Street: A Guide to American Commercial
                        Architecture</hi> (1987). Geographer Richard Francaviglia, on the other hand, examines their
                    symbolic significances in his "Main Street USA: The Creation of a Popular Image"
                    (1977). But nothing surpasses historian Lewis E. Ather-ton's <hi rend="i">Main Street on
                        the Middle Border</hi> (1954) as an exploration of retailing's social functioning
                    during the golden age of Main Street late in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth centuries.
                    Richard L. Mattson's "Store Front Remodelling on Main Street" (1983)
                    deals with twentieth-century modernizing in response to the rise of automobile-oriented commercial
                    strips.</p>
            <p>Many Indiana court seats are organized both with a Main Street and with a courthouse square, the two
                    usually integrated at the town center. Edward T. Price's "The Central Courthouse
                    Square in the American County Seat" (1968) and Marian M. Oh-man's
                    "Diffusion of Foursquare Courthouses to the Midwest, 1785–1885" (1982)
                    provide excellent introduction to the topic. Where did various plan forms originate? How were they
                    diffused? How did they impact surroundings place to place? What did they symbolize? What did the
                    mania for building large, spectacular courthouses symbolize for nineteenth-century Indiana (Figure
                    11). ORen located in squares at the core of business districts, what did they say about local
                    community? What do replacement court buildings located off the square—and often beyond
                    the edge of towns—have to say?</p>
            <p>The coming of the automobile changed the American Main Street as it changed American landscapes
                    generally. Things could be and were more spread out in geographical space. New kinds of land uses
                    were brought into novel juxtapositions. Increased mobility drove the central place functions of
                    retail and service trade up the hierarchy of towns and cities, leaving commercial districts in <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-089-3-030"/>

                    literature on the coming of the motor car and motor truck (for example, see Flick, 1988). In
                    thriving towns and cities automobility brought the commercial strip—an alignment of both
                    automobile-convenient and automobile-oriented business enterprise along principal thoroughfares and
                    peripheral highways. John A. Jakle's and Richard L. Mattson's "The
                    Evolution of a Commercial Strip" (1982) and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kent</settlement>

                    see, by way of example, Warren J. Belasco's <hi rend="i">Americans on the Road: From Auto

                    cultural equations of American society? How were they rooted in the American past?</p>
            <p>The highway, if not the automobile, stands symbolic of American twentieth-century landscape. From
                    historian Frederic L. Pax-son's (1946) "The Highway Movement,
                    1916–1935" through <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-089-3-031"/> geographer Peter J.

                    </placeName>, 1880–1929," many scholars have sought to explore the evolving
                    American road both as structure and as symbol. Perhaps none have proven more insightful than J. Todd
                    Snow in his "The New Road in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>" (1967). Snow saw the limited access freeways as alienated from their
                    surroundings—the landscape pushed back at arm's length. Travelers are no longer
                    in the landscape as they were with the traditional road where things were accessed close at hand and
                    where life could be viewed directly in passing. The histories of specific highways provide linear
                    traverses through time and space. George R. Stewart's <hi rend="i">U.S. 40: Cross Section

                    Schlereth's <hi rend="i">U.S. 40: A Roadscape of the American Experience</hi> (1985).
                    Important also is Drake Hokanson's <hi rend="i">The <placeName>

            <p>The highway replaced the railroad as prime organizer of American geography. Railroads drove the
                    growth of towns and cities in the mid-to-late nineteenth century as highway and air connectivity do
                    today. Towns bypassed by railroads withered; towns served by railroads thrived according to the
                    capacities of local entrepreneurs and the wealth of established hinterlands. Railroads influenced
                    urban morphology. Streetcars and mass transit lines enabled high density cities and, consequently,
                    encouraged a concentrated and fully vibrant streetlife—what Americans came to associate
                    with the urbane. John R. Stilgoe's <hi rend="i">Metropolitan Corridor: Railroads and the
                        American Scene</hi> (1983) focuses directly on the railroad as landscape feature, looking
                    especially at railroad rights-of-way and adjacent land uses. Susan D. Walther's <hi rend="i">The Railroad in the American Landscape</hi> (1981) offers broader social

            <p>Before concluding, however, I would like to call attention to three additional works. These might be
                    the first works that the <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-089-3-032"/> curious initiate to the study of
                    landscape would seek to access. The first book is the initial volume of Donald W. Meinig's
                        <hi rend="i">The Shaping of America</hi> (1986). Meinig, perhaps the leading historical

                    the evolving American experience. Focusing on European imperialism, Meinig places the colonization
                    of North America firmly within emergent capitalism's European-centered spatial frame.
                    Meinig is not as concerned with physical environmental underpinnings nor with emergent cultural
                    landscapes as he is with the grand overview focused on the geographical realities of imperial
                    strategy.</p>
            <p>The second book is J. Carville Earle's <hi rend="i">Geographical Inquiry and American
                        Historical Problems</hi> (1992). Earle explores, again from distinctly geographical viewpoints,
                    central processes that have defined the American experienc—olonization, regional
                    development and sectionalism, industrialization, and urbanization. He seeks to anchor the human
                    actions behind historical events in the social coordinates of place. His chapters serve as clear
                    examples of geographical history. The third book, Terry G. Jordan's and Matti E.
                    Kaups's <hi rend="i">The American Backwoods Frontier: An Ethnic and Ecological
                        Interpretation</hi> (1989) takes the final step. Concerned with imperial strategies and
                    dedicated to big questions of history, <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName> and Kaup extend discussion to issues of landscape, emphasizing material culture: the
                    steel ax and hunting rifle, the log cabin and worm fence, and corn and hog
                    agriculture—the essence of a rapidly shifting western frontier. In these three
                    masterworks is the story that leads directly to Indiana's settlement and the threshold of
                    the state's modern development. These three books alone should sufficiently energize the
                    would-be scholar of Indiana's geographical history by giving focus and meaning to landscape
                    as an organizing intellectual construct and source of inspiration.</p>
            <p>How does all of this sum up? As a long time aficionado of Indiana, a historical geographer, and a
                    dedicated student of American landscape, I have attempted to showcase here relevant scholarship
                    suggestive of, if not directly contributory to, a geographical history of the Hoosier state focused
                    on the concerns of landscape. For those who might follow my direction a word of warning may be in
                    order. The historian who adopts the landscape view stands to be forever diverted. The landscape will
                    loom quickly as evocatively problematical. The features of landscape will soon provide constant
                    intellectual referent. What is that? How did it get there? What does it mean? How does it relate to
                    other things elsewhere? The historian will become preoccupied with the passing scene. Coming to
                    different places (crossing state lines for example) will excite, in and of itself, basic curiosity.
                    Things previously ignored <pb n="[203]" id="VAA4025-089-3-033"/>
                    <figure>
                  <p>Fig. 12. Landscape study is an invitation to oral history. Putting down his newspaper the
                            barber in this Roachdale shop talked at length about what made Indiana a distinctive
                        place.</p>
               </figure> will take urgency. The lid will be off of Pandora's box. The landscape will loom
                    as a new kind of archive. The landscape will become something important, in itself worth explaining.
                    The historian will have a whole new way of being in the world at once disturbing to old ways of
                    thinking yet intrinsically exciting.</p>
            <p>Americans have tended to view history as something apart from the mainstream (Lowenthal, 1985).
                    History is viewed as past. Pastness when it survives in the contemporary scene (in the relic
                    features of landscape, for example) is generally ignored although things truly significant from the
                    past may be enshrined as "historic sites." Monuments may be erected to remember
                    significant people and events, or physical fabric surviving from the past may be preserved as museum
                    display—historic places variously contrived. Historians have traditionally aided and
                    abetted the cultivation of a sense of history set apart from the here and now. However, coupling the
                    traditional archive with the study of landscape may counter this tendency (Figure 12). The
                    contemporary <pb n="204" id="VAA4025-089-3-034"/> landscape will become a point of departure in
                    intellectually reconstituting past landscapes over time. As an archive of historical significance,
                    the landscape itself will not only inspire questions but will provide some of the evidence for
                    informed answers. Finally, historians may be turned to advocating historical values as relevant to
                    contemporary landscapes—landscapes seen not only as unique historical displays but as
                    lived-in places in the contemporary social milieu. History will no longer seem so essentially past.
                    It will become something alive that encompasses and can be touched and experienced as environment.
                    History will live in the accretions or the overlays of today's landscape.</p>

                    prestigious and, in a sense, at the pinnacle of his scholarly career. He was president of the
                    American Historical Association, and his essay on "The Significance of the Frontier in

                    <pb n="212" id="VAA4025-089-3-042"/> Turner intended in the commencement address to combine history
                    with exhortation and speak on the subject "Pioneer Ideals and the State
                    University." He planned to send an advance copy of his text to his friend James A.
                    Woodburn, senior professor of history at Indiana University. Turner invited Woodburn to
                    "censure [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] any sentences that might make trouble." But he
                    went on to add: "Of course I don't agree not to keep them in … if after
                    consultation I conclude they should stand— … I prefer as a matter of
                    precaution to give you the opportunity to hold up any thing that seems harmful." Turner
                    doubted that he had "any stuff that a sensational reporter might distort into
                    trouble-making utterances. Of course," he continued, "if there are any statements
                    or ideas that might make trouble for <hi rend="i">me</hi> though not for the <hi rend="i">University
                        of Indiana</hi> [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], I am willing to let them stand. I merely wish to give
                    you a free hand in the <hi rend="i">reports</hi> to safeguard the University."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> If Woodburn made any suggestions, evidence of them is not found in their
                    correspondence. Turner probably delivered his address as originally written.</p>
            <p>"Pioneer Ideals and the State University" proved to be a remarkable essay in many
                        ways.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> It was not the traditional collection of platitudes, even by early
                    twentieth-century standards. Nevertheless, the audience probably took pleasure in Turner's
                    paean of praise for the democratic ideology and contribution to national development that he
                    attributed to the pioneer settlers of the Old Northwest. Their individualism, their love of
                    democracy (which Turner never defined), their distrust of aristocracy, and their willingness to do
                    the hard work so essential to opening a new country proclaimed the success of the frontier era.
                    Available resources, especially land, had provided a safety valve that allowed their pioneer society
                    to expand and further democratic institutions. But, Turner pointed out, the frontier era had passed:
                    the time for the rule-of-thumb and the jack-of-all-trades was over. A modern industrial society
                    required an educated electorate as well as scientifically trained experts if it hoped to prosper and
                    to preserve its institutions. On the frontier the "first ideal of the pioneer was that of
                    conquest." With the frontier era at a close the American people lived in an industrial
                    urban society where, Turner insisted, the "test tube and the microscope are needed rather
                    than the ax and the rifle."</p>

            <p>A thoughtful reading of the commencement address indicates that Turner did have some
                    "sensational" stuff in it, especially for a Hoosier audience, even in the
                    Progressive Era. Aside from reiterating his views on the significance of the frontier, which were
                    then gaining almost universal credence, Turner, like many of his scientific contemporaries, warned
                    of Malthusian consequences as the population of the world increased and the number of available
                    resources diminished. But he was not a pessimistic doomsayer. The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, even without a frontier of available land, was not inevitably destined to economic and
                    political decline or, more important, to surrender its democratic institutions. To Turner, a
                    thorough-going progressive determined to preserve middle-class, democratic institutions, the time
                    had come to set aside the unrestrained individualism of the frontier era, when each person sought to
                    take and use as many resources as possible in any way possible, and to replace it with an
                    individualism that recognized the significance of the community and was willing to serve a larger
                    good. Thus, for Turner, the time had come when the lasting democratic values of the frontier would
                    be promoted not by the rugged individualism of E. H. Harriman, the railroad tycoon, but by
                    university-educated men and women who would find a common ground between the competing classes in
                    society.</p>
            <p>Turner's essay has a remarkably contemporary quality about it, especially in an era when
                    American society is again in transition. He understood then, as most people do today, that a new era
                    required new skills. Turner's faith in education sounds, even after eighty years, much like
                    what Americans are again offered as the solution to the nation's changing economy. Turner,
                    however, went further than contemporary politicians dared: he argued that without change
                    America's democratic institutions themselves were in jeopardy.</p>
            <p>Professional historians, who have been quick to set Turnerian ideas in amber as of 1893, or to
                    identify him as part of the pessimistic academic community of the turn of the century, might well
                    reread this essay. Turner did, indeed, continue to defend his frontier thesis, but he also
                    recognized that Americans should not attempt to preserve those attributes of the frontier that were
                    poorly suited to the twentieth century. He believed that free public education, especially the
                    Hoosier variety, offered a viable substitute for the frontier. It gave virtually everyone, native
                    and immigrant, regardless of origin, access not only to the technical skills essential to prosper in
                    the twentieth century but also to the cultural values of the dominant middle-class society on which
                    his version of democracy was founded.</p>
            <p>Turner's address does not rank with General George C. Marshall's commencement
                    speech at <placeName>

                    War 11, but it was an intellectually challenging talk that—despite some dubious
                    historical generalizations—still warrants reading.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ideals of a people, the aspirations and convictions, their hopes and ambitions, their dreams and
                    determinations, are assets in their civilization as real and important as per capita wealth or
                    industrial skill.</p>
            <p>This nation was formed under pioneer ideals. During three centuries after Captain John Smith struck
                    the first blow at the American forest on the eastern edge of the continent, the pioneers were
                    abandoning settled society for the wilderness, seeking, for generation after generation, new
                    frontiers. Their experiences left abiding influences upon the ideas and purposes of the nation.
                    Indeed the older settled regions themselves were shaped profoundly by the very fact that the whole
                    nation was pioneering and that in the development of the West the East had its own part.</p>
            <p>The first ideal of the pioneer was that of conquest. It was his task to fight with nature for the
                    chance to exist. Not as in older countries did this contest take place in a mythical past, told in
                    folk lore and epic. It has been continuous to our own day. Facing each generation of pioneers was
                    the unmastered continent. Vast forests blocked the way; mountainous ramparts interposed; desolate,
                    grassclad prairies, barren oceans of rolling plains, arid deserts, and a fierce race of savages, all
                    had to be met and defeated. The rifle and the axe are the symbols of the backwoods pioneer. They
                    meant a training in aggressive courage, in domination, in directness of action, in destructiveness.</p>
            <p>To the pioneer the forest was no friendly resource for posterity, no object of careful economy. He
                    must wage a hand to hand war upon it, cutting and burning a little space to let in the light upon a
                    dozen acres of hard won soil, and year after year, expanding the clearing into new woodlands against
                    the stubborn resistance of primeval trunks and matted roots. He made war against the rank fertility
                    of the soil. While new worlds of virgin land lay ever just beyond, it was idle to expect the pioneer
                    to stay his hand and turn to scientific farming. Indeed, as Secretary Wilson has said, the pioneer
                    would, in that case, have raised wheat that no one wanted to eat, corn to store on the farm, and
                    cotton not worth the picking.</p>
            <p>Thus, fired with the ideal of subduing the wilderness, the destroying pioneer fought his way across
                    the continent, masterful <list type="footnotes">

                    fighter—the trailmaker for civilization, the inventor of new ways. Although Rudyard
                    Kipling's "Foreloper" deals with the English pioneer in lands beneath the
                    Southern Cross, yet the poem portrays American traits as well: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            God's utmost will, unknowing his desire; And he shall see old planets pass and
                            alien stars arise, And give the gale his reckless sail in shadow of new skies.</p>
                        <p>"Strong lust of gear shall drive him out and hunger arm his hand To wring his food
                            from desert nude, his foothold from the sand. His neighbors' smoke shall vex his
                            eyes, their voices break his rest; He shall go forth till south is north, sullen and
                            dispossessed; He shall desire loneliness and his desire shall bring Hard on his heels, a
                            thousand wheels, a people and a king.</p>
                        <p>"He shall come back on his own track, and by his scarce cool camp, There shall he

            <p>This quest after the unknown, this yearning "beyond the sky line, where the strange roads go
                    down," is of the very essence of the backwoods pioneer, even though he was unconscious of
                    its spiritual significance.</p>
            <p>The pioneer was taught in the school of experience that the crops of one area would not do for a new
                    frontier; that the scythe of the clearing must be replaced by the reaper of the prairies. He was
                    forced to make old tools serve new uses; to shape former habits, institutions and ideas to changed
                    conditions; and to find new means when the old proved inapplicable. He was building a new society as
                    well as breaking new soil; he had the ideal of nonconformity and of change. He rebelled against the
                    conventional.</p>
            <p>Besides the ideals of conquest and of discovery, the pioneer had the ideal of personal development,
                    free from social and governmental constraint. He came from a civilization based on individual
                    competition, and he brought the conception with him to the wilderness where a wealth of resources,
                    and innumerable opportunities gave it a new scope. The prizes were for the keenest and the
                    strongest; for them were the best bottom lands, the finest timber tracts, the best salt-springs, the
                    richest ore beds; and not only these natural gifts, but also the opportunities afforded in the midst
                    of a forming society. Here were mill sites, town sites, transportation lines, banking centers,
                    openings in the law, in politics—all the varied chances for advancement afforded in a
                    rapidly developing society where everything was open to him who knew how to seize the opportunity.</p>
            <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-089-3-047"/>
            <p>The squatter enforced his claim to lands even against the government's title by the use of
                    extra-legal combinations and force. He appealed to lynch law with little hesitation. He was
                    impatient of any governmental restriction upon his individual right to deal with the wilderness.</p>
            <p>In our own day we sometimes hear of congressmen sent to jail for violating land laws; but the
                    different spirit in the pioneer days may be illustrated by a speech of Delegate Sibley of Minnesota
                    in Congress in 1852. In view of the fact that he became the state's first governor, a
                    regent of its university, president of its historical society, and a doctor of laws of <placeName>

                            trespassing on the public domain. The proceeds of his long winter's work are reft
                            from him, and exposed to public sale for the benefit of his paternal government.

            <p>Thus many of the pioneers, following the ideal of the right of the individual to rise, subordinated
                    the rights of the nation and posterity to the desire that the country should be "developed
                    and that the individual should advance with as little interference as possible. Squatter doctrines
                    and individualism have left deep traces upon American conceptions.</p>
            <p>But quite as deeply fixed in the pioneer's mind as the ideal of individualism was the ideal
                    of democracy. He had a passionate hatred for aristrocracy, monopoly and special privilege; he
                    believed in simplicity, economy and in the rule of the people. It is true that he honored the
                    successful man, and that he strove in all ways to advance himself. But the West was so free and so
                    vast, the barriers to individual achievement were so remote, that the pioneer was hardly conscious
                    that any danger to equality could come from his competition for natural resources. He thought of
                    democracy as in some way the result of our political institutions, and he failed to <pb n="218" id="VAA4025-089-3-048"/> see that it was primarily the result of the free lands and immense
                    opportunities which surrounded him. Occasional statesmen voice the idea that American democracy was
                    based on the abundance of unoccupied land, even in the first debates on the public domain. Gallatin,
                    for instance, declared in 1796, that "if the cause of the happiness of this country were
                    examined into, it would be found to arise as much from the great plenty of land in proportion to the
                    inhabitants which their citizens enjoyed as from the wisdom of their political
                    institutions." Another congressman still earlier replied to the argument that cheap lands
                    would depopulate the Atlantic states by saying that if a land law were framed to prevent ready
                    access to western lands it would be tantamount to saying that there is some class which must remain.
                    … and by law be obliged to serve the others for such wages as they please to
                    give."</p>
            <p>This early recognition of the influence of abundance of land in shaping the economic conditions of
                    American democracy is peculiarly significant to-day in view of the practical exhaustion of the
                    supply of cheap arable public lands open to the poor man, and the coincident development of labor
                    unions to keep up wages.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that the strength of democratic movements have chiefly lain in the regions of the
                    pioneer. "Our governments tend too much to democracy," wrote Izard, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to Jefferson, in 1785. "A handicraftsman thinks an apprenticeship necessary
                    to make him acquainted with his business. But our backcountrymen are of the opinion that a
                    politician may be born just as well as a poet."</p>
            <p>The revolutionary ideas, of course, gave a great impetus to democracy, and in substantially every
                    colony there was a double revolution, one for independence and the other for the overthrow of
                    aristocratic control. But in the long run the effective force behind American democracy was the
                    presence of the practically free land into which men might escape from oppression or inequalities
                    which burdened them in the older settlements. This possibility compelled the coastwise states to
                    liberalize the franchise; and it prevented the formation of a dominant class, whether based on
                    property or on custom. Among the pioneers one man was as good as his neighbor. He had the same
                    chance; conditions were simple and free. Economic equality fostered political equality. An
                    optimistic and buoyant belief in the worth of the plain people, a devout faith in man prevailed in
                    the West. Democracy became almost the religion of the pioneer. He held with passionate devotion the
                    idea that he was building under freedom a new society, based on self government, and for the welfare
                    of the average man.</p>
            <p>And yet even as he proclaimed the gospel of democracy the pioneer showed a vague apprehension lest
                    the time be short—lest equality should not endure—lest he might fall behind in
                    the ascending movement of western society. This led him on in feverish <pb n="219" id="VAA4025-089-3-049"/> haste to acquire advantages as though he only half believed his dream.
                    "Before him lies a boundless continent," wrote De Tocqueville, in the days when
                    pioneer democracy was triumphant under <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "and he urges forward as if time pressed and he was afraid of finding no room
                    for his exertions."</p>
            <p>Even while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> lived, labor leaders and speculative thinkers were demanding legislation to place a
                    limit on the amount of land which one person might acquire and to provide free farms. De Tocqueville
                    saw the signs of change. "Between the workman and the master," he said,
                    "there are frequent relations but no real association. …. I am of the opinion,
                    upon the whole, that the manufacturing aristocracy which is growing up under our eyes is one of the
                    harshest which ever existed in the world; …. if ever a permanent inequality, of
                    conditions and aristocracy again penetrate into the world, it may be predicted that this is the gate
                    by which they will enter." But the sanative influences of the vast free spaces of the West
                    were destined to ameliorate labor's condition, to afford new hopes and new faith to pioneer
                    democracy, and to postpone the problem.</p>
            <p>As the settlers advanced into provinces whose area dwarfed that of the older sections, pioneer
                    democracy itself began to undergo changes, both in its composition and in its processes of
                    expansion. At the close of the Civil War, when settlement was spreading with greatest vigor across
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, the railways began their work as colonists. Their vast land grants from the
                    government, amounting altogether by 1871 to an area five times that of the State of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, demanded purchasers, and so the railroads pioneered the way for the pioneer. The new
                    homestead law increased the tide of settlers. The improved farm machinery made it possible for him
                    to go boldly out on to the prairie and to deal effectively with virgin soil in farms whose
                    cultivated area made the old clearings of the backwoodsman seem mere garden plots. Two things
                    resulted from these conditions, which profoundly modified pioneer ideals. In the first place the new
                    form of colonization demanded an increasing use of capital; and the rapidity of the formation of
                    towns, the speed with which society developed, made men the more eager to secure bank credit to deal
                    with the new West. This made the pioneer more dependent on the eastern economic forces. In the
                    second place the farmer became dependent as never before on transportation companies. In this
                    speculative movement the railroads, finding that they had pressed too far in advance and had issued
                    stock too freely for their earnings to justify the face of the investment, came into collision with
                    the pioneer on the question of rates and of discriminations. The greenback movement and the granger
                    movements were appeals to government to prevent what the pioneer thought to be invasions of pioneer
                    democracy. As the western settler began to face the problem of magnitude <pb n="220" id="VAA4025-089-3-050"/> in the areas he was occupying; as he began to adjust his life to the
                    modern forces of capital and to complex productive processes; as he began to see that, go where he
                    would, the questions of credit and currency, of transportation and distribution in general
                    conditioned his success, he sought relief by legislation. He began to lose his primitive attitude of
                    individualism, government began to look less like a necessary evil and more like an instrument for
                    the perpetuation of his democratic ideals. In brief, the defenses of the pioneer democrat began to
                    shift from free land to legislation, from the ideal of individualism to the ideal of social control
                    through regulation by law. He had no sympathy with a radical reconstruction of society by the
                    revolution of socialism; even his alliances with the movement of organized labor, which paralleled
                    that of organized capital in the East, were only halfhearted. But he was becoming alarmed over the
                    future of the free democratic ideal. The wisdom of his legislation it is not necessary to discuss
                    here. The essential point is that his conception of the right of government to control social
                    process had undergone a change. He was coming to regard legislation as an instrument of social
                    construction. The individualism of the Kentucky pioneer of 1796 was giving way to the populism of
                    the Kansas pioneer of 1896.</p>
            <p>The later days of pioneer democracy are too familiar to require much exposition. But they are
                    profoundly significant. As the pioneer doctrine of free competition for the resources of the nation
                    revealed its tendencies; as individual, corporation and trust, like the pioneer, turned increasingly
                    to legal devices to promote their contrasting ideals, the natural resources were falling into
                    private possession. Tides of alien immigrants were surging into the country to replace the old
                    American stock in the labor market, to lower the standard of living and to increase the pressure of
                    population upon the land. Professor <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> has recently pointed out that six million immigrants have reached the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> since 1900. "The newcomers of these eight years alone would re-populate all
                    the five older New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> states as they stand today; or, if properly disseminated over the newer parts of the
                    country they would serve to populate no less than nineteen states of the Union as they stand. The
                    immigration of 1907 alone would …. found a state with more inhabitants than any one of
                    twenty-one of our other existing commonwealths." These recent foreigners have lodged almost
                    exclusively in the dozen great centers of industrial life, and there they have accented the
                    antagonisms between capital and labor by the fact that the labor supply has become increasingly
                    foreign born, and recruited from nationalities who arouse no sympathy on the part of capital and
                    little on the part of the general public. Class distinctions are accented by national prejudices,
                    and democracy is thereby invaded. But even in the dull brains of great masses of these unfortunates
                    from southern and eastern Europe <pb n="221" id="VAA4025-089-3-051"/> the idea of America as the
                    land of freedom and of opportunity to rise, the land of pioneer democratic ideals, has found some
                    lodgment, and if it is given time and is not turned into revolutionary lines it will fructify.</p>
            <p>As the American pioneer passed on in advance of this new tide of European immigration, he found lands
                    increasingly limited. In place of the old lavish opportunity for the settler to set his stakes where
                    he would, there were frantic rushes of thousands of eager pioneers across the line of newly offered
                    Indian reservations. Even in 1889, when Oklahoma was opened to settlement, twenty thousand settlers
                    crowded at the boundaries, like straining athletes, waiting the bugle note that should start the
                    race across the line. To-day great crowds gather at the land lotteries of the government as the
                    remaining fragments of the public domain are flung to hungry settlers. Hundreds of thousands of
                    pioneers from the Middle West have crossed the national boundary into the Canadian wheat fields
                    eager to find farms for their children, although under an alien flag. And finally the government has
                    taken to itself great areas of arid land for reclamation by costly irrigation projects whereby to
                    furnish twenty-acre tracts in the desert to settlers under careful regulation of water rights. The
                    government supplies the capital for vast irrigation dams and reservoirs and builds them itself. It
                    owns and operates quarries, coal mines and timber to facilitate this work. It seeks the remotest
                    regions of the earth for crops suitable for these areas. It analyzes the soils and tells the farmer
                    what and when and how to plant. It has even considered the rental to manufacturers of the surplus
                    water, electrical and steam power generated in its irrigation works and the utilization of this
                    power to extract nitrates from the air to replenish wornout soils. The pioneer of the arid region
                    must be both a capitalist and the protege of the government.</p>
            <p>Consider the contrast between the conditions of the pioneers at the beginning and at the end of this
                    period of development. Three hundred years ago adventurous Englishmen on the coast of Virginia began
                    the attack on the wilderness. Three years ago the President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> summoned the governors of forty-six states to deliberate upon the danger of the
                    exhaustion of the natural resources of the nation.</p>
            <p>The pressure of population upon the food supply is already felt and we are at the beginning only of
                    this transformation. It is profoundly significant that at the very time when American democracy is
                    becoming conscious that its pioneer basis of free land and sparse population is giving way, it is
                    also brought face to face with the startling outcome of its old ideals of individualism and
                    exploitation under competition uncontrolled by government. Pioneer society itself was not
                    sufficiently sophisticated to work out to its logical result the conception of the self-made man.
                    But the captains <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-089-3-052"/> of industry by applying squatter doctrines to
                    the evolution of American industrial society, have made the process so clear that he who runs may
                    read. Contests imply alliances as well as rivalries. The increasing magnitude of the areas to be
                    dealt with and the occurrences of times of industrial stress furnished occasion for such unions. The
                    panic of 1873 was followed by an unprecedented combination of individual businesses and partnerships
                    into corporations. The panic of 1893 marked the beginning of an extraordinary development of
                    corporate combinations into pools and trusts, agreements and absorptions, until, by the time of the
                    panic of 1907, it seemed not impossible that the outcome of free competition under individualism was
                    to be monopoly of the most important natural resources and processes by a limited group of men whose
                    vast fortunes were so invested in allied and dependent industries that they constituted the
                    dominating force in the industrial life of the nation. The development of large scale factory
                    production, the benefit of combination in the competitive struggle, and the tremendous advantage of
                    concentration in securing possession of the unoccupied opportunties were so great that vast
                    accumulations of capital became the normal agency of the industrial world. In almost exact ratio to
                    the diminution of the supply of unpossessed resources, combinations of capital have increased in
                    magnitude and in efficiency of conquest. The solitary backwoodsman sinking his axe into the edge of
                    a measureless forest is replaced by companies capitalized at millions, operating railroads,
                    sawmills, and all the enginery of modern machinery to harvest the remaining trees. The self-made man
                    of pioneer days has become the coal baron, the steel king, the oil king, the cattle king, the
                    railroad magnate, the master of high finance, the monarch of trusts. The world has never before seen
                    such huge fortunes exercising combined control over the economic life of a people and such gross
                    extravagance and luxury as have come out of the individualistic pioneer democracy of America in the
                    course of its competitive evolution.</p>
            <p>But great masters of industry with their hundreds of millions of dollars and their financial
                    relations with other groups of multimillionaires, however strongly they assert the economic
                    advantages of combination, do not admit that they have broken with pioneer ideals. They regard
                    themselves as pioneers under changed conditions, carrying on the old work of developing the natural
                    resources of the nation, following the compulsion of the constructive fever in their veins even in
                    ill-health and old age, seeking new avenues of activity, chopping new clearings, finding new trails,
                    expanding the horizon of the nation's activity.</p>
            <p>"This country," said the late Mr. Harriman in an interview three years ago,
                    "has been developed by a wonderful people, flush with enthusiasm, imagination and
                    speculative bent." "They have been magnificent pioneers. They saw into the future
                    and adapted <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-089-3-053"/> their work to the possibilities."
                    "Stifle that enthusiasm, deaden that imagination and prohibit that speculation by
                    restrictive and cramping conservative law, and you tend to produce a moribund and conservative
                    people and country." "There is much left to be developed in this country. Towns
                    are growing like magic and its people are toiling like the Aladdin lamp genii." But Mr.
                    Harriman was silent on the questions of who was Aladdin, for whom the palace was to rise, and what
                    kind of a palace it was to be. And the American people are startled at the portentous figures which
                    emerge as the logical outcome of this struggle for the triumph of the strongest.</p>
            <p>If I have been successful in my presentation so far, it has been seen that two ideals were
                    fundamental in pioneer thought: the ideal of individual freedom to compete unrestrictedly for the
                    resources of a continent, and the ideal of democracy; that the unfolding of these ideals has taken
                    place contemporaneously with the passing into private possession of the free public domain and the
                    natural resources of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on which pioneer democracy was based; and that time has thus revealed the fact that
                    pioneer democracy's two ideals had elements of inconsistency and contained the seeds of its
                    own dissolution.</p>
            <p>A new national development is before us without the former safety valve of abundant resources open to
                    him who would take. Classes are becoming alarmingly distinct: There is the demand on the one side
                    voiced by Mr. Harriman so well and by others since, that nothing must be done to interfere with the
                    early pioneer ideals of the exploitation and the development of the country's wealth; that
                    restrictive and reforming legislation must on no account threaten prosperity even for a moment. In
                    fact, we sometimes hear in these days, from men of influence, serious doubts of democracy, and
                    intimations that the country would be better off if it freely resigned itself to guidance by the
                    geniuses who are mastering the economic forces of the nation, and who, it is alleged, would work out
                    the prosperity of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> more effectively, if unvexed by politicians and people.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, an inharmonious group of reformers are sounding the warning that American
                    democratic ideals and society are menaced and already invaded by the very conditions that make this
                    apparent prosperity; that the economic resources are no longer limitless and free; that the
                    aggregate national wealth is increasing at the cost of present social justice and moral health, and
                    the future well-being of the American people. The granger and the populist were prophets of this
                    reform movement. Mr. Bryan's democracy, Mr. Debs' socialism, and Mr.
                    Roosevelt's republicanism all had in common the emphasis upon the need of governmental
                    regulation of industrial tendencies in the interest of the common man; the checking of the power of
                    those business Titans who <pb n="224" id="VAA4025-089-3-054"/> emerged successful out of the
                    competitive individualism of pioneer America. As land values rise, as meat and bread grow dearer, as
                    the process of industrial consolidation goes on, and as eastern industrial conditions spread across
                    the West, the problems of traditional American democracy will become increasingly grave.</p>
            <p>The time has come when University men may well consider pioneer ideals, for American society has
                    reached the end of the first great period in its formation. It must survey itself, reflect upon its
                    origins, consider what freightage of purposes it carried in its long march across the continent,
                    what ambitions it had for the man, what role it would play in the world. How shall we conserve what
                    was best in pioneer ideals? How adjust the old conceptions to the changed conditions of modern life?</p>
            <p>Other nations have been rich and prosperous and powerful. But the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has believed that it had an original contribution to make to the history of society by
                    the production of a self-determining, self-restrained, intelligent democracy. It is in the Middle
                    West that society has formed on lines least like those of Europe. It is here, if anywhere, that
                    American democracy will make its stand against the tendency to adjust to a European type.</p>
            <p>This consideration gives importance to my final topic, the relation of the University to pioneer
                    ideals and to the changing conditions of American democracy. President Pritchett of the Carnegie
                    Foundation has recently declared that in no other form of popular activity does a nation or state so
                    clearly reveal its ideals or the quality of its civilization as in its system of education; and he
                    finds, especially in the state university, "a conception of education from the standpoint
                    of the whole people." "If our American democracy were to-day called to give proof
                    of its constructive ability," he says, "the State University and the public school
                    system which it crowns would be the strongest evidence of its fitness which it could
                    offer."</p>
            <p>It may at least be conceded that an essential characteristic of the State University is its democracy
                    in the largest sense. The provision in the Constitution of Indiana of 1816, so familiar to you all,
                    for a "general system of education ascending in regular gradations from township schools to
                    a State University, wherein tuition shall be gratis and equally open to all," expresses the
                    Middle Western conception born in the days of pioneer society and doubtless deeply influenced by
                    Jeffersonian democracy.</p>
            <p>The most obvious fact about these universities, perhaps, lies in their integral relation with the
                    public schools, whereby the pupil has pressed upon him the question whether he shall go to college,
                    and whereby the road is made open and direct to the highest training. By this means the state offers
                    to every class the means of education, and even engages in propaganda to induce students to
                    continue. It sinks deep shafts through the social strata to find the gold of real ability in the
                    underlying rock of the masses. It fosters <pb n="225" id="VAA4025-089-3-055"/> that due degree of
                    individualism which is implied in the right of every human being to have opportunity to rise in
                    whatever directions his peculiar abilities entitle him to go, subordinate to the welfare of the
                    state. It keeps the avenues of promotion to the highest offices, the highest honors, open to the
                    humblest and most obscure lad who has the natural gifts, at the same time that it aids in the
                    improvement of the masses.</p>
            <p>Nothing in our educational history is more striking than the steady pressure of democracy upon its
                    universities to adapt them to the requirements of all the people. From the State Universities of the
                    Middle West, shaped under pioneer ideals, have come the fuller recognition of scientific studies,
                    and especially those of applied science devoted to the conquest of nature; the breaking down of the
                    traditional required curriculum; the union of vocational and college work in the same institution;
                    the development of agricultural and engineering colleges and business courses; the training of
                    lawyers, administrators, public men, and journalists—all under the ideal of service to
                    democracy rather than of individual advancement alone. Other Universities do the same things; but
                    the head springs and the main current of this great stream of tendency come from the land of the
                    pioneers, the democratic states of the Middle West. And the people themselves, through their boards
                    of trustees and the legislature, are in the last resort the court of appeal as to the directions and
                    conditions of growth, as well as have the fountain of income from which these universities derive
                    their existence.</p>
            <p>The State University has thus both a peculiar power in the directness of its influence upon the whole
                    people and a peculiar limitation in its independence upon the people. The ideals of the people
                    constitute the atmosphere in which it moves, though it can itself affect this atmosphere. Herein is
                    the source of its strength and the direction of its difficulties. For to fulfill its mission of
                    uplifting the state to continuously higher levels the University must, in the words of Mr. Bryce,
                    "serve the time without yielding to it;" it must recognize new needs without
                    becoming subordinate to the immediately practical, to the short-sightedly expedient. It must not
                    sacrifice the higher efficiency for the more obvious but lower efficiency. It must have the wisdom
                    to make expenditures for results which pay manifold in the enrichment of civilization, but which are
                    not immediate and palpable.</p>
            <p>In the transitional conditions of American democracy which I have tried to indicate, the mission of
                    the University is most important. The times call for educated leaders. General experience and
                    rule-of-thumb information are inadequate for the solution of the problems of a democracy which no
                    longer owns the safety fund of an unlimited quantity of untouched resources. Scientific farming must
                    increase the yield of the soil, scientific forestry must economize the woodlands, scientific
                    experiment and construction by <pb n="226" id="VAA4025-089-3-056"/> chemist, physicist, biologist
                    and engineer must be applied to all of nature's forces in our complex modern society. The
                    test tube and the microscope are needed rather than axe and rifle in this new ideal of conquest. The
                    very discoveries of science in such fields as public health and manufacturing processes have made it
                    necessary to depend upon the expert, and if the ranks of experts are to be recruited broadly from
                    the democratic masses as well as from those of larger means, the State Universities must furnish at
                    least as liberal opportunities for research and training as the universities based on private
                    endowments furnish. It needs no argument to show that it is not to the advantage of democracy to
                    give over the training of the expert exclusively to privately endowed institutions.</p>
            <p>But quite as much in the field of legislation and of public life in general as in the industrial
                    world is the expert needed. The industrial conditions which shape society are too complex, problems
                    of labor, finance, social reform too difficult to be dealt with intelligently and wisely without the
                    leadership of highly educated men familiar with the legislation and literature on social questions
                    in other states and nations.</p>
            <p>By training in science, in law, politics, economics and history the universities may supply from the
                    ranks of democracy administrators, legislators, judges and experts for commissions who shall
                    disinterestedly and intelligently mediate between contending interests. When the words
                    "capitalistic classes" and "the proletariat" can be used and
                    understood in America it is surely time to develop such men, with the ideal of service to the state,
                    who may help to break the force of these collisions, to find common grounds between the contestants
                    and to possess the respect and confidence of all parties which are genuinely loyal to the best
                    American ideals. The signs of such a development are already plain in the expert commissions of some
                    states; in the increasing proportion of university men in legislatures; in the university
                    men's influence in federal departments and commissions. It is hardly too much to say that
                    the best hope of intelligent and principled progress in economic and social legislation and
                    administration lies in the increasing influence of American universities. By sending out these
                    open-minded experts, by furnishing well-fitted legislators, public leaders and teachers, by
                    graduating successive armies of enlightened citizens accustomed to deal dispassionately with the
                    problems of modern life, able to think for themselves, governed not by ignorance, by prejudice or by
                    impulse, but by knowledge and reason and high-mindedness, the State Universities will safeguard
                    democracy. Without such leaders and followers democratic reactions may create revolutions, but they
                    will not be able to produce industrial and social progress. America's problem is not
                    violently to introduce democratic ideals, but to preserve and entrench them by courageous <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-089-3-057"/> adaptation to new conditions. Educated leadership sets bulwarks
                    against both the passionate impulses of the mob the sinister designs of those who would subordinate
                    public welfare to private greed. Lord Bacon's splended utterance still rings true:
                    "The learning of the few is despotism; the learning of the many is liberty. And intelligent
                    and principled liberty is fame, wisdom and power."</p>
            <p>There is a danger to the universities in this very opportunity. At first pioneer democracy had scant
                    respect for the expert. He believed that "a fool can put on his coat better than a wise man
                    can do it for him." There is much truth in the belief; and the educated leader, even he who
                    has been trained under present university conditions, in direct contact with the world about him,
                    will still have to contend with this inherited suspicion of the expert. But if he be well trained
                    and worthy of his training, if he be endowed with creative imagination and personality, he will make
                    good his leadership.</p>
            <p>A more serious danger will come when the universities are fully recognized as powerful factors in
                    shaping the life of the state—not mere cloisters, remote from its life, but an
                    influential element in its life. Then it may easily happen that the smoke of the battle-field of
                    political and social controversy will obscure their pure air, that efforts will be made to stamp out
                    the exceptional doctrine and the exceptional man. Those who investigate and teach within the
                    university walls must respond to the injunction of the church, <hi rend="i">"Sussum
                        cords"</hi>—lift up the heart to high thinking and impartial search for the
                    unsullied truth in the interests of all the people; this is the holy grail of the universities. That
                    they may perform their work they must be left free, as the pioneer was free, to explore new regions
                    and to report what they find; for like the pioneers they have the ideal of investigation, they seek
                    new horizons. They are not tied to past knowledge; they recognize the fact that the universe still
                    abounds in mystery, that science and society have not crystallized, but are still growing and need
                    their pioneer trailmakers. New and beneficent discoveries in nature, new and beneficent discoveries
                    in the processes and directions of the growth of society, substitutes for the vanishing material
                    basis of pioneer democracy may be expected if the university pioneers are left free to seek the
                    trail.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the university has a duty in adjusting pioneer ideals to the new requirements of
                    American democracy, even more important than those which I have named. The early pioneer was an
                    individualist and a seeker after the undiscovered; but he did not understand the richness and
                    complexity of life as a whole; he did not fully realize his opportunities of individualism and
                    discovery. He stood in his somber forest as the traveler sometime stands in a village on the Alps
                    when the mist has shrouded everything, <pb n="228" id="VAA4025-089-3-058"/> and only the squalid
                    hut, the stony field, the muddy pathway are in view. But suddenly a wind sweeps the fog away. Vast
                    fields of radiant snow and sparkling ice lie before him; profound abysses open at his feet; and as
                    he lifts his eyes the unimaginable peak of the Matterhorn cleaves the thin air, far, far above. A
                    new and unsuspected world is revealed all about him. Thus it is the function of the university to
                    reveal to the individual the mystery and the glory of life as a whole—to open all the
                    realms of rational human enjoyment and achievement; to preserve the consciousness of the past; to
                    spread before the eye the beauty of the universe; and to throw wide its portals of duty and of power
                    to the human soul. It must honor the poet and painter, the writer and the teacher, the scientist and
                    the inventor, the musician and the prophet of righteousness—the men of genius in all
                    fields who make life nobler. It must call forth anew, and for finer uses, the pioneer's
                    love of creative individualism and provide for it a spiritual atmosphere friendly to the development
                    of personality in all uplifting ways. It must check the tendency to act in mediocre social masses
                    with undue emphasis upon the ideals of prosperity and politics. In short, it must summon ability of
                    all kinds to joyous and earnest effort for the welfare and the spiritual enrichment of society. It
                    must awaken new tastes and ambitions among the people.</p>
            <p>Mr. Godkin in a notable essay on "Aristocratic Opinions of Democracy" pointed out
                    nearly half a century ago that the incentive to exertion which is widest, most constant and most
                    powerful in its operations in all civilized countries is the desire of distinction, and that this
                    may be composed of the love of fame as well as the love of wealth. He truly says that "one
                    of the most marked peculiarities of democratic society is the fevered anxiety which possesses all
                    its members to rise above the dead level to which the law is ever seeking to confine them, and by
                    some brilliant stroke become something higher and more remarkable than their fellows. The secret of
                    that great restlessness. … is due to the eagerness of everybody to grasp the prizes of
                    which in an aristocratic society only the few have much chance." ….</p>
            <p>These are words of insight and of truth. The light of these university watch towers should flash from
                    state to state until American democracy itself is illuminated with higher and broader ideals of what
                    constitutes service to the state and to mankind; of what one prizes; of what is worthy of praise and
                    reward. So long as success in amassing great wealth for the aggrandizement of the individual is the
                    exclusive or the dominant standard of success, so long as material prosperity, regardless of the
                    conditions of its cost, or the civilization which results, is the shibboleth, American democracy,
                    that faith in the common man which the pioneer cherishes, is in danger. For the strongest will make
                    their way unerringly to whatever goal society sets up as the mark of conceded preeminence. <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-089-3-059"/> What more effective agency is there for the cultivation of the
                    seed wheat of ideals than the university? Where can we find a more promising body of sowers of the
                    grain?</p>
            <p>The pioneer's clearing must be broadened into a domain where all that is worthy of human
                    endeavor may find fertile soil on which to grow; and America must exact of the constructive business
                    geniuses who have sprung from the loins of pioneer democracy supreme allegiance and devotion to the
                    commonweal. In fostering such an outcome and in tempering the asperities of the conflicts that must
                    precede its fulfillment, the nation has no more promising agency than the State Universities, no
                    more hopeful product than their graduates.</p>

            <p>"The one-room school was the best school we ever had," stated the prominent

                    virtue, he believed, in the elements of a one-room education, elements such as emphasis on basics,
                    individual instruction, and a deliberate mixing of grades and ages so that older students helped
                    teach the younger pupils—and thus learned from repetition.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Bettelheim's views helped spark new interest in the traditionally rural one-room schools,
                    and in recent years a number of rural and urban school corporations have built and staffed one-room
                    schoolhouses both to demonstrate early educational practices and to provide alternative educational
                    experiences for modern pupils. Educators and historians who once damned the rural one-room schools
                    as purveyors of inferior education have begun to take a second look.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The grounds on which the schools sat provided plenty of opportunity to run and play although there
                    was very little playground equipment except that constructed by a creative teacher with the
                    assistance of energetic boys from the "Big Room" or provided with proceeds from
                    the annual pie supper. Calls from Mother Nature necessitated a trip across the school grounds to the
                    outhouse or, in the more primitive schools, across the road to the protection of a rock ledge. The
                    type of outhouse reflected community standards. Some privies featured separate entrances for girls
                    and boys but shared a dividing wall. Other communities, however, would not tolerate the indecency of
                    such a common wall and insisted on separate facilities. A progressive day for students and teachers
                    alike was the construction of "Roosevelt" toilets with concrete floors and vents

                    unfortunately, it could be used only for drainage purposes. Water buckets and common dippers for
                    drinking were eventually replaced by individual tin cups that were hung on pegs at the back of the
                    room or in the cloak room.</p>
            <p>Most school lunches were carried from home in a "lard bucket," small pail, or new
                    lunch bucket. Members of the same family often ate their lunch from one basket prepared by their
                    mother. Lunches in the 1920s and 1930s consisted of fruit and other foods that were grown or made on
                    the farm as well as numerous varieties of biscuit sandwiches: biscuits with jelly faded into the
                    torn bread, biscuits spread with butter or lard and sprinkled with sugar, or biscuits with cold
                    sausage cakes. Students in the 1950s and 1960s whose routine fare was leftovers envied students who

            <p>Certainly the facilities in these one-room schools were very primitive, and students were deprived of
                    many instructional resources afforded children in town schools. Libraries were nonexistent, and

                    compulsory attendance had become law in 1897, myriad reasons were considered valid for not
                    infrequent absences. In one teacher's attendance records, for example, notations for
                    excused absences included typhoid fever, "croupe," sore throat, creek up, no

                    to complete their high school education. During this fifty-year period the list of valedictorians of
                    OHS included the names of twenty-one rural transfer students. Thus, 30 percent of the population

            <p>Through their responses to a written survey, the rural valedictorians of Orleans High School provide,
                    while not a definitive answer to Fuller's query, at least a glimpse of the one- and
                    two-room schools that were a part of their educational heritage. Seventeen rural valedictorians
                    participated in the original study, completed in December, 1985. Three of the twenty-one were
                    deceased; thus, eighteen were contacted with seventeen responding. Five of them returned comments so
                    extensive that additional postage was required on the prestamped envelopes which were included with
                    the survey questionnaire. The respondents focused on their schools' structure, curriculum,
                    and activities; their adjustments upon leaving the rural school; and, ultimately, their reactions to
                    the small high school from which they graduated. Throughout their comments they emphasized the
                    experiences they perceived to be important to their academic success. Indeed, these students who
                    went on to become valedictorians of Orleans High School concurred that there was value in their
                    learning experiences in the small rural schools. They fondly recalled the
                    "readin', ‘ritin’, and ‘rithmetic" and
                    recognized the strengths of this seemingly archaic system.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No attempt was made to determine validity of the survey instrument sent to these valedictorians, to
                    correlate results, or to establish statistical significance. There is no basis for assuming that the
                    experiences of these students were either typical or atypical of their peers; and, finally, the
                    reader cannot conclude that the observations, experiences, and success stories here recorded can be
                    applied to other populations. The information should merely be appreciated for what it
                    is—a description of the one-room school experience as remembered by the living OHS
                    valedictorians who received a part of their early education in the rural schools of Northeast,
                    Orangeville, and Northwest townships, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The fifty-year period 1926–1975 was selected because the 1975
                    graduates were the last to have attended the one-room schools for at least a part of their
                    educational experience.</p>

                    "apparatus" and served community scholars until 1831 when the first actual school
                    building was erected near the center of the town. Until it was replaced in 1963 with the present
                    elementary school building, it remained the only site of elementary school education for Orleans
                    students. A separate high school building was erected in 1910.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> From 1926 to
                    1975, the period of this study, there was no emergent trend of change in the number of Orleans High
                    School graduates. The mean number of graduates was 42.26; the median 41. Size of graduating class
                    ranged from a low of 27 (1928, 1949, 1951) to a high of 60 (1930, 1969). [See Table 1.]</p>

                        school."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Indeed, except for required core classes, teachers were
                    given much latitude in designing the course of study, and their abilities and interests often
                    determined the subjects offered. Over the fifty-year period, however, there was surprisingly little
                    variation in the curriculum. Reading, writing, arithmetic, and spelling were the basic subjects in
                    the early grades. Gradually geography, elementary science, history, grammar, health, and sometimes
                    even home economics and agriculture were added to the daily routine.</p>
            <p>There was little emphasis on teaching music and physical education, but both were integrated into
                    daily activities for enjoyment. Music, the recitation of memory verses from the Bible, the pledge of
                    allegiance, and sometimes a brief moral or patriotic story were often included in daily
                    "opening exercises" for the entire room. One school was fortunate enough to have

                    from another school gained an appreciation for classical music when the teacher played records and
                    had contests to see which student could identify the most compositions (Flora Johnson Lashley,
                    1937). Physical education evolved from student-organized activities at recess or noonhour. Every
                    inch of the school grounds was utilized for favorite games—drop the handkerchief,
                    chicken, fox and geese, "unstructured" softball, Andy over, tag, Red Rover. Many
                    students recalled that teachers sometimes went outside to play with them and seemed to have as much
                    fun as the pupils did.</p>
            <p>Moral education was a part of the curriculum, but it generally appeared in subtle ways. Teachers were
                    expected to provide a good example for students, and those who did not were, without the protection
                    of a union, dismissed from their duties. Children carried from home a sense of right and wrong and
                    respect for the rights and property of others and for school property. They seemed to have a clear
                    idea that they were expected to behave and to do their best; further, if they got in trouble at
                    school, they would most assuredly be corrected at home. All of the parents knew the teachers and
                    respected them and their right to teach the children to "mind" at school and to
                    reinforce the moral foundation that had been laid at home. "Cheating, lying, and stealing
                    were not done; we considered them sins. Christian ethics were respected even by those who were not
                    Christian" (Eleanor Walker Caplinger, 1943).<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Trustees and parents often preferred a strong-willed male teacher for students in the "Big
                    Room." Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, however, teachers apparently
                    could not administer corporal punishment injudiciously. In fact, some of the early school record
                    books provided a line for reporting the number of cases of corporal punishment; none were reported.</p>
            <p>Teachers in these early one- and two-room rural schools often assigned their pupils a variety of
                    chores: cleaning chalkboards and erasers, carrying drinking water from the well, bringing in wood or
                    coal for the stove, helping younger students. Whether or not these jobs were intended to teach
                    responsibility and cooperation, such was one end result. During the early years of this study,
                    teachers generally assigned chores according to students' capabilities and grade levels.
                    "I usually viewed any such assignment as a privilege. Most were usually eager to
                    help" (Eleanor Walker Caplinger, 1943). Teachers sometimes secured student cooperation by
                    providing group incentives. When pupils in grades 7 and 8 at <list type="footnotes">

                            admonition might occur in an unusual form. One student recalls an impressive lesson that her
                            mother provided for a student who was stealing her lunch apples. The next day's
                            apple featured red pepper that had been inserted in discreetly positioned holes crafted with
                            a hatpin (Alice Cottengaim Moffatt, 1930).</item>

                    a radio for the classroom; another year he took the students on a weekend trip to Renfro Valley and <placeName>

            <p>As long as teachers completed the required number of days of instruction, they could modify the
                    school calendar as well as the curriculum. As Stella Freed noted in her record book for 1931:
                    "I did not teach on Friday after Christmas. This day was made up in March." Also
                    to be made up in March was "One extra day taken off during teacher's association.
                    …"</p>
            <p>Individualized instruction was the norm in the one-room schools—particularly for the
                    superior scholars. In this early "open concept" atmosphere, the teacher generally
                    would spend a few minutes giving each class an assignment in a particular subject. Then while these
                    students worked at their desks, other classes would in turn come to the recitation bench to present
                    the assignments that they had prepared. While this recitation was in progress, pupils working at
                    their seats were obviously aware of what was being said at the recitation site. Some completely
                    tuned out this classroom "noise"; others listened yet still found time to complete
                    their own assignments. Those who finished their own work could participate silently in the
                    recitations of others. If they did not entirely comprehend what they were doing at the time, the
                    concept was easier to master when it was their turn to learn it because they had already been
                    introduced to it via eavesdropping. Further, they had participated passively in the achievements of
                    those who had gone before, and they, too, aspired to success. Most of the valedictorians indicated
                    that this experience had a positive effect on learning.</p>

                    <p>You always hear the others recite in a one-room school. That's what kept me from being

                        others did. I didn't try to concentrate while classes recited. I already knew what was

            <p>Official student academic records also attest to the fact that one-room schools provided the ultimate
                    in individualized instruction. In addition to midterm and final scores for examinations that were
                    required before students could complete the eighth grade, these records include comments on
                    individual pupils' progress and achievements. John T. Radcliff of Green Brier School in
                    Orangeville Township noted at the end of the school year on April 26, 1924, "All required
                    work completed except the last 6 pages of 7th grade arithmetic." Separate notations
                    indicated that a particular student should "start on page 70 of the arithmetic
                    book" and that "additional help is needed with reading."</p>
            <p>If a student was academically strong and perhaps the only one in a specific grade, he or she was
                    sometimes allowed to skip a grade. One valedictorian recalled that she was the only first grader the
                    year that she started school. Because of parental encouragement, however, she had already learned
                    most things expected from a beginner. "Therefore, I recited with the second grade almost
                    all year. Naturally I was promoted to the third grade at the end of the term. Then we were a large
                    class of five members" (Eleanor Walker Caplinger, 1943)! Another valedictorian recalled
                    that, as the only student in the first grade, she was permitted to recite with the one student in
                    grade two and progressed at her own speed.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Most of the time I spent listening to what all the others were reciting. … I never

                        my older brother's 4th grade books, do my older sister's 6th grade spelling,
                        and hold my own at the ciphering board with any one up to my older brother in grade 4, including
                        long columns of addition, long multiplication, and division (Grace Johnson Farrar, 1942).</p>

            <p>Teachers also encouraged students to participate in "enrichment" activities when
                    their lessons were completed. Those who had already mastered a concept might be assigned to help one
                    of their peers who was having difficulty. Allowed to whisper quietly to one another, both
                    students—as well as the burdened teacher—usually found this informal tutorial
                    system beneficial. Other pupils found pleasure in reaching for <hi rend="i">Compton's
                        Encyclopedia</hi> or working on the school newspaper. And, of course, one could always just sit
                    and listen to other classes recite.</p>
            <p>The rural students who eventually became valedictorians at Orleans High School brought with them to
                    the one-room schools an enduring love for competition. "Something or someone inspired the
                    ‘hustle’ in me. I was very desirous of making 100 percent everyday"
                    (Alice Cottengaim Moffatt, 1930). "I'm afraid I've always had a strong
                    competitive spirit. When someone told me I couldn't do something, I had a tendency to say,
                    ‘I'll show them’" (Flora Johnson <pb n="250" id="VAA4025-089-3-080"/> Lashley, 1937). Students seemed to know what their families and their
                    community expected of them, and this knowledge contributed to their motivation toward academic
                    excellence.</p>
            <p>Home chores and summer work often heightened this spirit of competition. One student recalled trying
                    to pick as many blackberries as her mom and also trying to chop two rows of weeds while her dad
                    chopped four, at the same time always competing with her own record in her attempt to improve her
                    "race" with her father (Alice Cottengaim Moffatt, 1930). Teachers were able to
                    harness this competitiveness—not in the athletic arena but in the academic sphere.
                    Apparently the brighter students profited.</p>
            <p>Friday afternoon spelldowns and ciphering matches were common. Students who emerged victorious from
                    their grade's contest advanced to compete with students of the next grade until, finally,
                    the winner of the "Room" was declared. Spelling and ciphering matches were also
                    common entertainment at the school's pie suppers. Parents often joined the competition only
                    to be bested by a bright seventh or eighth grader. Obviously such events were more enjoyable for the
                    students who excelled than for those less adept. Some students expressed enthusiasm: "I
                    loved the ciphering. I think that's where I learned to love math" (Mary Rose Clipp
                    Rosen-baum, 1950). Others felt chagrin: "I hated them. I didn't like to let
                    someone do better than I did. I was embarrassed to lose" (Wanda Johnson Carroll, 1957).</p>
            <p>Wise teachers encouraged students to better their own performances and sometimes provided small
                    prizes for those who achieved 100 percent in all their work on a given day. Pencils purchased from
                    the teacher's meager pay or "headmarks" cut from paper or small
                    "pocket" books are still among the treasured memorabilia of some rural school
                    graduates.</p>
            <p>The township trustees had sole responsibility for the hiring and firing of teachers in the rural
                    elementary schools. Such a system had both strengths and weaknesses. If there was an effective
                    teacher in a one-room school, that teacher would likely remain for several years; hence, students
                    had the advantage of continuing under the same person's tutelage. An ineffective teacher
                    could easily be, and often was, removed from the classroom. Unfortunately, teachers were sometimes
                    also fired because of a whim on the part of the township trustee or because of a personality
                    conflict with influential members of the community or the trustee. Further, nepotism in the school
                    system was not uncommon, and applicants were not discouraged from attempting to influence hiring
                    decisions by providing gratuities to township trustees.</p>
            <p>Most of the valedictorians spoke highly of their teachers and readily identified a
                    "favorite." A 1926 graduate recalled a superior teacher who was impressive with
                    his presentation of "the analytical method" of solving arithmetic problems (Agnes
                    McIntyre Hopping, <pb n="251" id="VAA4025-089-3-081"/> 1926). Another memorable teacher was
                    described as adhering to the philosophy that <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>… when we study we work hard and when we have recess we play hard. He expected us
                            to do our assignments and never left a bit of doubt that he was in charge of the classroom.
                            He spelled out expectations of behavior clearly and fairly together with proper punishments
                            that we could depend on him to carry out should we disobey. He held no grudges. As soon as
                            the discipline was completed we knew beyond a doubt that he was our friend. … In
                            the old vernacular, <hi rend="i">he was strict</hi>. We respected and loved him for it (Mary

                    to sit down and talk with students who seemed to have problems outside the academic domain. These
                    caring teachers sometimes even brought lunch for students who could not afford their own and managed
                    a treat for every child at Christmastime when they themselves might be wearing shoes with thin
                    soles.</p>
            <p>Five of the valedictorians (1937–1971) cited the same teacher, Miller Scarlett, as their
                    favorite. One wrote, "… in this day and age he would have been
                    ‘Teacher of the Year’" (Grace Johnson Farrar, 1942).
                    Students' comments were replete with memories of the innovative things that this
                    Orangeville teacher introduced into the classroom.</p>

                        rosy hot and our backsides cold, but we were lost in adventure. One book he read was <hi rend="i">Alice of <placeName>

                        scarcely any one had a car it was as exciting as a trip overseas now (Grace Johnson Farrar,
                        1942).</p>
                    <p>He did unusual things no other teacher did then. In studying Indians and pioneers we tried the
                        methods of survival. I'll never forget bringing a potato and egg to school, covering
                        them with mud, and baking them in coals for lunch (Grace Johnson Farrar, 1942).</p>

                    <p>He started the first hot lunches by having the 7th and 8th grade girls cook soup or beans for
                        their home economics instruction. He had a monthly newspaper. … We even sold
                        advertising. … We held mock elections, went through the whole election process. We
                        would stage plays, make our own stage curtain from a sheet, exit lights from tin cans, print our
                        own programs, and make our own costumes (Betty Radcliff Parish, 1946).</p>

            <p>Most of the students were lifetime residents of the small communities in which they attended school.
                    Many of their parents and even grandparents had lived there throughout their lifetimes as well.
                    Generally there was more than one sibling in school at one time, and the children felt a special
                    responsibility to one another. They also knew, however, that if they misbehaved the story of their
                    antics would probably arrive home before they did. There was a great deal of encouragement from
                    home. Students were not specifically admonished to do well; they just sensed the need to do their
                    best—both academically and behaviorally.</p>
            <p>The feeling that the school was an extension of the community is apparent in the visitors registers
                    that were kept. In 1924 C. H. Radcliff recorded a visit to Green Brier School in Orangeville
                    Township of "about 50 students for debate" as well as visits from the county
                    nurse, attendance officer, county superintendent, and trustee. E. C. Quakenbush's record

               </table> Quakenbush also noted: "This school is easy to manage and like to work about as
                    good as any school I ever saw. The patrons are not much for visiting the school though."
                    Parents knew the teachers but, indeed, rarely visited school except for special occasions such as
                    Christmas programs, pie suppers, and end-of-school programs. Dessie Moon, teacher at Bromer School
                    in Northeast Township, recorded in 1928: "The last day of school was April 6. The school
                    gave a program and patrons and friends came with well-filled baskets." And one young man
                    proudly recalled that his dad played the fiddle at the last day of school celebration (Emery
                    Johnson, 1944).</p>
            <p>The annual pie supper, a major fund-raising event, fostered community goodwill as well as garnered
                    money for library books, playground equipment, games, and other special things that were not a part
                    of the township's meager budget. Bertha Felknor notes in her report for Orangeville School,
                    Orangeville Township, on May 3, 1929:</p>

            <p>Some of the students found it necessary to carry work home, but those who did not often read books
                    after they completed their chores for the day. Only the last four valedictorians had access to
                    television. Four of the twenty-one valedictorians came from one family, and one of these children
                    recalled: "family evenings during winters were spent around the one stove in the living
                    room with each member taking turns reading from a classic while others shelled corn, quilted, etc.
                    And so we went through <hi rend="i">Silas Marner, David Copperfield</hi>, and many others"
                    (Grace Johnson Farrar, 1942). No doubt this reading reinforced both learning and the attitude toward
                    learning.</p>
            <p>Most of the valedictorians had some chores to do upon arriving home. One 1956 graduate remarked:
                    "I had chores such as feeding the animals and milking the cows morning and night as well as
                    helping out in any other way whenever needed. I was taught responsibility at a very early age (4)
                    and I was always reponsible for my actions" (Phyllis Wilson Minnott, 1956). She believed
                    that her family's expectations in regard to responsibility and work carried over to her
                    academic success. Rural children knew that if they did not do the job correctly there would be no
                    second chance that day and that their parents were not going to check their performance and redo the
                    task. "My success in school and later in life stems, I believe, from the emphasis my
                    parents placed on education and in doing any job correctly. Farm families were generally closer due
                    to the nature of the work environment" (Phyllis Wilson Minnott, 1956).</p>
            <p>Although overwhelmed at first, students from Northeast, Northwest, and Orangeville townships quickly
                    adapted to Orleans High School. New friendships were soon formed, often among both
                    "good" pupils and academically "poorer" ones. Close friendships
                    frequently developed between town students and country students, and such associations provided the
                    best of both worlds. The small size of the high school probably eased the transition for the rural
                    students. The average graduating class during the fifty-year span from 1926 to 1975 was only
                    fortyltwo although each class was considerably larger when it entered the ninth grade.</p>
            <p>Most rural students felt adequately prepared for high school although an occasional
                    "knowledge" gap appeared in college preparatory <pb n="[255]" id="VAA4025-089-3-085"/>

                    when it came to music; and, of course, very few played in the high school band as most town pupils
                    had begun the program when they were still in elementary school. In fact, few rural children
                    participated in any extracurricular activities because of the inconvenience of staying after school.
                    Most needed to ride the buses home because there was no alternative transportation and because there
                    were farm chores to do.</p>
            <p>Rural students found that the quality of instruction in high school varied from class to class
                    whereas in their one-room elementary schools the entire school year had reflected the abilities of
                    just one teacher. Further, academically superior students were often bored because teachers in the
                    larger high school classes usually felt that they should teach to the median, and repetition of
                    concepts grew dull. Most of the Orleans High School teachers had great respect for the rural
                    students, especially if an older sibling had done well. Although the valedictorians remarked that
                    they were accepted as individuals and treated as such, they all sensed that their families expected
                    high achievement and that the faculty, because of past family performances, did too. Here, again,
                    these rural students emphasized family values and expectations as inspirational goals.</p>
            <p>After graduation from high school all except five of the eighteen students who participated in this
                    study continued their education. Those who did not cited financial circumstances as the deterrent.
                    Five went on to earn teaching certificates; two completed two-year degrees; two earned Ph.D.s; three
                    became certified public accountants; one became a registered pharmacist, one a nurse, and one a
                    medical doctor. It seems likely that these rural valedictorians of Orleans High School would have
                    experienced success in almost any school setting. Their families' expectations and
                    encouragement early fostered their sense of uniqueness and their desire to excel. Assigned chores
                    cultivated feelings of responsibility and self-worth. Such chores also kept them busy, and the lack
                    of ready transportation to town compelled them to occupy themselves in their pastoral environment
                    where few commercial diversions were available. And while about half of these rural students would
                    not want their children to attend a one-room school, all concur that when you had a good teacher,
                    you had an excellent experience.</p>

            <p>Dorothy C. Collins and Cecil K. Byrd have collaborated in the preparation of the first pictorial
                    history of Indiana University that is sure to be prominently displayed on alumni coffee tables
                    throughout the state, across the country, and around the world. Indiana University is, as President
                    Thomas Ehrlich writes in the foreword to this volume, "one university with eight front
                    doors" (p. viii). While photographs from all of the university's campuses are
                    represented here, those from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus dominate this volume that tells the university's story from its
                    founding in 1820 to the present. Indiana University at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a beautiful place, and the pictures reproduced here reflect its charm. As Ehrlich
                    puts it, "you can almost hear ‘Chimes of Indiana’ ringing
                    …" (p. viii).</p>
            <p>As a first of its kind, this history presents a carefully crafted presentation of the
                    university's past. Collins wrote the Introductory Chronicle and was responsible for all of
                    the pictures from the early years. These photographs are among the best and surely represent hours
                    of patient digging in archives and solicitation through letters and telephone calls. The result was
                    worth the effort. Along with traditional pictures of early presidents and faculty come photographs
                    of Sarah Parke Morrison and Marcellus Neal, the first woman and the first African American,
                    respectively, to graduate from the university. In addition, there are charming photographs of an
                    early <placeName>

                    unusual montage of prominent local citizens of 1860.</p>
            <p>Byrd was responsible for the color photographs from more recent years, and they are, in every sense,
                    traditional representations of university life. There are all the conventional scenes: students
                    studying and attending class outdoors on sunny days or huddled under umbrellas while walking in the
                    rain, bicycles jammed in front of Ballantine Hall, beautiful fall foliage, and, inevitably, Coach
                    Bobby Knight and his victorious basketball team.</p>
            <p>The other seven doors of Indiana University are represented with mostly architectural color
                    photographs, although earlier black-and-white pictures give some sense of student life. Perhaps <pb n="[259]" id="VAA4025-089-3-089"/>

            <p>Every institution has its ups and downs, but Indiana University's history, at least as it is
                    presented here, is one of an almost seamless series of ups. If universities serve as arenas for
                    clashing opinions, IU appears to be an unusually calm playing field. The reader would never guess,
                    for example, that there were protests against McCarthyism on campus during the 1950s. Collins
                    downplays the significance of the student movement in the 1960s, and there is no mention of large
                    demonstrations against a tuition increase in 1969 (although there is a poignant picture of students
                    pleading for legislative appropriations in front of a billboard in 1929). Moreover, there are only a
                    few pictures showing contributions to the university made by people of color. Aside from an early
                    photograph of the Cosmopolitan Club taken in 1920, little attention is given to Indiana
                    University's large—and one would think quite photogenic—international
                    student population.</p>
            <p>Still, as Indiana University's first pictorial history, this volume is sure to please
                    alumni, whose gifts and donations are carefully noted throughout its pages. The illustrations
                    selected to tell IU's history are of good quality and tastefully presented. Without doubt,
                    this book will be at the top of the list for countless Hoosiers as this year's ideal
                    Christmas present—both to give and to receive.</p>

                    in tribute to its many spires and its mix of strong denominationalism. The tradition stems from the
                    city's earliest days when the first major voluntary organizations in town were religious
                    ones. Remarkably, all of those pioneer churches and synagogues continue to flourish today. In <hi rend="i">Frontier Faith</hi> George Ross Mather, a Presbyterian minister, chronicles the first

               <hi rend="i">Frontier Faith</hi> is excellent on two counts. First, the author is committed to
                    fleshing out the personalities of the principal players. Using private and ecclesiastical
                    correspondence, newspapers, and a variety of church records, Mather puts color on pioneer cheeks;
                    and he has an eye for the vignette that amuses while it informs about social custom. By way of
                    example there is the worthy Fried-rich Konrad Dietrich Wyneken, a strict Lutheran divine, who grows
                    immeasurably more amiable (and complex) as readers learn how he scandalized local deacons by
                    sporting yellow britches donated by a Catholic merchant. A second major contribution of <hi rend="i">Frontier Faith</hi> is the inspiration it ought to provide for writers of local history. Mather
                    has proved that the sources can be rich and varied and that considerable narratives can be drawn
                    from key personalities and from the social/moral concerns they espoused and debated. The
                    seventy-three pages of notes and sources that Mather appends to this book suggest that research into
                    the cultural roots of other localities might be equally rewarding.</p>

                    Although the author relegates to an appendix a detailed discussion of the heritage question that
                    failed to surface until long after Posey's death, he nevertheless labors relationships with <placeName>

                    Father of his country sterile?</p>
            <p>The author dramatizes Posey's heroic and "relentless bayonet charge" that
                    won the day at Stoney Point (p. 581, his march with troops "barefoot and half

            <p>After the war Colonel Posey became "Thomas Posey, Gentleman," who married
                    "an eligible widow of means," fathered nine children (p. 1101, and had
                    "no difficulty settling comfortably" at "Greenwood,"

                    Archibald Alexander. "The Poseys," Alexander observed, "though somewhat
                    decayed in wealth, maintained much of the style which belonged to old Virginia families"
                    (p. 117).</p>
            <p>In 1802 the Poseys trekked to western Kentucky and resettled at "Longview" on the

                    war hero, Charles Scott, defeated him, partly because of Posey's federalist sympathies and
                    his ultra-federalist friends, one of whom, Joseph Montfort Street, married his daughter.</p>
            <p>Frustrated by defeat, Posey went to <placeName>

                    collections behind that facade. Although David A. Randall died in May, 1975, some readers may well
                    remember him as the Lilly librarian who came to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> campus in 1956 having previously served as a bookseller in the Rare Book Department of
                    Scribner's Book Store. During his Lilly Library career Randall recruited such notable
                    catalogers as Josiah &amp;. Bennett, and he acquired collections ranging from the wondrous (for
                    example, George <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-089-3-095"/> A. Poole's with its New Testament
                    portion of the Gutenberg Bible) to the whimsical (for instance, Ian Fleming's manuscript
                    materials relating to his James Bond series). All these he added, of course, to Josiah K.
                    Lilly's books and manuscripts on science, especially medicine, and American literature.</p>
            <p>The first part of this work, actually a succinct, single chapter of twenty pages, provides a brief

                    more in the three years I spent with him than [in] any other comparable period" (p. 6).
                    Indicating that he intended to establish a free-standing rare book library on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> campus, Josiah K. Lilly personally asked for Randall as librarian, and the next twenty
                    years saw the Lilly Library issue striking exhibition catalogs and double the existing
                    collection's size.</p>
            <p>With brief headnotes by the compiler, the second part of this slim volume reprints twenty-four of
                    Randall's most important essays and articles, including several still worth
                    reading—notably, his notes on rarity, auction cataloging policies, and "The
                    Adventure of the Notorious Forger." Readers wishing to delve deeper into Randall's
                    writings will appreciate part 3, the more-than-160-item chronological checklist of his works,
                    including his highly readable and opinionated autobiography published as <hi rend="i">Dukedom Large
                        Enough</hi> (1969).</p>
            <p>In summary, Randall's Indiana University legacy, made possible by Lilly's funds, is
                    the establishment of one of the great American collections of rare books and manuscripts. If these
                    be the terms of greatness for a bibliographer—collection growth and influence in his
                    chosen field—then Randall certainly deserves his place in Scarecrow Press's
                    Great Bibliographers series.</p>

            <p>In the early nineteenth century Americans were eager to make new contributions to knowledge. Their
                    eagerness extended to science as to other fields, and the years 1800–1840 witnessed the
                    emergence of new societies and periodicals devoted specifically to science. Thomas Say, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> naturalist, played an important role in the new developments. In this biography
                    Patricia Tyson Stroud examines Say's life and work and in so doing identifies important
                    features of American science in the early nineteenth century. Say was among the founders of <placeName>

                    frequent descriptions and classifications of insects and mollusks in the journal established his
                    scientific reputation and in 1818 landed him an appointment as zoologist to the Long Expedition.
                    Collections made during those explorations enabled him to provide the first detailed descriptions of
                    the coyote and the plains gray wolf and to produce his most notable scientific study, <hi rend="i">American Entomology</hi>. More important, Stroud maintains that Say's scientific work
                    was representative of early nineteenth-century American natural history. Say's publications
                    emphasized the practical and economic importance of insects. While opposing scientific
                    specialization, he advocated that Americans study their own flora and fauna rather than relying on
                    the work of European naturalists. Stroud's study also illustrates the crucial role that
                    patronage played in Say's career. Much of Say's scientific research relied on the
                    largess of the geologist William Maclure. Maclure provided resources for Say's early
                    scientific work, and Say adopted Maclure's social and educational views and became a
                    mainstay of Maclure's utopian experiment at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. As Maclure's representative in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Say edited a newspaper and kept alive the utopian ideal. Say also continued publishing
                    his volumes of <hi rend="i">American Entomology</hi> and <hi rend="i">American Conchology;</hi> but
                    as Stroud effectively indicates, Say's obligations prevented him from undertaking
                    fieldwork, and his isolation from scientific colleagues and activities proved increasingly
                    frustrating both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>Stroud's biography is a fine study of Say's life and career. In addition to
                    offering new insights into the scientist's personality and contributions, the discussion of
                    Say's later life provides one of the most complete examinations of science at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Despite Say's many accomplishments, however, there is little that is
                    distinctive or unique about his science, and not surprisingly the author offers no new
                    interpretation of natural history in the early Republic. This portrayal of Say's life and
                    work reinforces and provides a personal dimension to current understanding of the major features of
                    American science in the early nineteenth century.</p>

                    Disaster</hi>. By Peter S. Felknor. (Ames: Iowa State University Press, 1992. Pp. xvii, 131: Map,

            <p>As people go about their daily lives, it is easy to forget the powerful forces of nature that lie
                    just over the horizon. Thunderstorms, <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-089-3-098"/> hurricanes, and tornadoes
                    are all fearsome reminders of how quickly nature can transform itself from nurturer to destroyer.
                    Peter S. Felknor's account, <hi rend="i">The Tri-State Tornado</hi>, is a case in point.
                    One moment <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>, was a sleepy little Ozark hamlet; the next moment much of
                    the town had blown away, and four people lay dead in the remnants. The nation's worst
                    tornado disaster had begun its awful odyssey.</p>
            <p>From its initial touchdown in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> just after one o'clock on the afternoon of March 18, 1925, to shortly after
                    half past four that same afternoon, the tornado cut an uninterrupted path of death and destruction
                    some 219 miles in length and up to a mile in width. Its course carried it across three states,
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and Indiana, at forward speeds reaching as much as
                    seventy-three miles per hour. The tornado did its greatest damage in Illinois where 606 lives were
                    lost, 1,563 were injured, and over $13 million dollars in property was destroyed. In the
                    three states combined the death toll numbered 689, more than twice any previous record for a single
                    tornado (p. 120). The combined injury and property losses for all three states reached 1,980 and
                    $16,532,000 respectively. As dramatic as these figures appear, they would have been much
                    worse had the tornado not followed a predominantly rural course.</p>
            <p>Felknor wants the story of this little-known disaster to be told in the words of those who
                    experienced it (p. 28); thus, he uses the remembrances of fourteen eyewitnesses who ranged in age at
                    the time from children to young adults. Their accounts along with newspaper reports of the tornado
                    constitute the major sources of information used in the author's reconstruction of events.
                    Felknor arranges his material into seven chapters beginning with the eyewitnesses' first
                    responses to the disaster and continuing through their visual images of the sights and sounds of the
                    tornado, the depth of details they remembered, the pain and suffering caused by the tornado, the
                    bizarre aspects of the tragedy, the problems brought to the devastated area, and finally the psychic
                    effect the disaster had on its survivors. In 1992, a year that witnessed the devastation of
                    Hurricane Andrew, the author reminds readers that such catastrophes are not one great disaster but
                    many little personal disasters.</p>
            <p>Felknor bookends these seven chapters, which are the heart of his work, between an introduction and
                    two concluding chapters that deal with the nature of tornadoes. These sections, especially a
                    hypothetical narrative in the introduction that introduces the reader to the spectacle of a
                    tornado's birth (p. xi), provide useful information for understanding tornadoes.</p>
            <p>The author did not set out to write a history of this catastrophe, nor did he. Instead his work is
                    largely a collection of personal remembrances of a common experience. His object is not to present a
                    single image of the disaster but rather to show its many-faceted <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-089-3-099"/> nature. As one eyewitness declares, "No matter how many people you talk to, you get a
                    different story, because everybody saw it from where they were" (p. 59). Thus <hi rend="i">The Tri-State Tornado</hi>, using vivid eyewitness accounts, has made a meaningful contribution
                    to folklore and popular culture through the convenient collection of the many personal stories it
                    reports.</p>

            <p>Aimed at tenth and twelfth grade students, this work originated in the efforts of a group of high
                    school teachers to obtain a suitable textbook for Kentucky Studies courses. The Kentucky Humanities
                    Council provided funds to determine how best to approach the creation of such a text. The Kentucky
                    Historical Society gave staff and logistical aid. A committee of nine teachers determined the format
                    of the text, which emphasizes a topical approach, and contacted possible authors. The Kentucky
                    Bicentennial Commission made this their primary educational project. The Ashland Oil Foundation
                    provided funding for publication.</p>
            <p>James C. Klotter, state historian and director of the Kentucky Historical Society, edited this
                    volume, which comprises nineteen essays. Most were written by historians and focus on aspects of
                    Kentucky history. These begin appropriately with geography and prehistory and conclude with
                    thoughtful pieces on education and the future of the commonwealth. Essays on government and
                    politics, religion, the performing arts, literature, and architecture are also included. Ample and
                    well-placed maps, drawings, photographs, and tables make this textbook visually appealing. A

            <p>Regional history conferences offer an important outlet for new historical research. Scholars should
                    therefore be grateful that the Eastern National Park and Monument Association has joined <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in publishing this set of selected conference papers.</p>
            <p>Three of the papers deal with the creation, provisioning, and impact of frontier forts. William L.
                    Otten, Jr., assesses the reasons for the construction of the first Fort Knox in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. His article would have been strengthened by a greater discussion of the
                    fort's impact. Kenneth C. Carstens carefully evaluates the munitions sent to Fort Jefferson
                    near the mouth of the Ohio and concludes that either George Rogers Clark's men carried
                    substantial extra munitions with them or that they were limited to an inadequate sixty-four rounds
                    per man. James E. Westerheider offers an excellent description of Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He concisely discusses the fort's construction, its role in Indian wars, and
                    the daily lives of officers and soldiers.</p>
            <p>Three papers review Native American topics. William L. Anderson offers brief sketches of Scots and
                    Irishmen who played a role in Indian affairs but does not discuss the general ethnic origins of
                    frontiersmen, the degree to which officials, soldiers, or traders of English origins played a role
                    on the frontier, or ways in which the origins of Scots and Irishmen had any real impact upon
                    colonial-Indian relations. He also errs in describing Sir William Johnson's birthplace.
                    Robert G. Gunderson's very perceptive essay assesses disease and alcoholism among Ohio
                    Valley Native Americans, <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-089-3-101"/> and explores some of their cultural
                    responses to near-apocalyptic death patterns. Leroy Eid explores reasons behind Arthur St.
                    Clair's great defeat in 1791 and in a colloquial essay suggests that an unidentified
                    Missisauga may have given the victorious Indians a common sense of purpose.</p>
            <p>Two additional articles illustrate the wide range of research in these papers and further demonstrate
                    the value of publishing conference proceedings. David Hsiung presents a clear picture of the rapid
                    economic growth of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> region; however, he needs to discuss more thoroughly any links between economic growth
                    and the appearance of classical education and formal manners. The final article by Lucy Jayne
                    Botscharow-Kanau closely inspects 1,237 land entries, 58 probated wills, and other documents in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. The author concludes that large pioneer families frequently left small
                    inheritances to their numerous children and that this situation led many families to migrate in
                    search of more land.</p>

                    By Michael N. McConnell. (<placeName>

                    bibliography, index. $40.00.)</head>
            <p>The "country between" of Michael N. McConnell's book is Pennsylvania west
                    of the Appalachians and Ohio east of the Scioto River. Emptied of native inhabitants during
                    seventeenth-century warfare, the area was entered by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, Shawnee, and Seneca tribespeople in the early eighteenth century. According to
                    McConnell they made a new life as "Indian pioneers," adopting features of European
                    American material culture and some beliefs while fashioning an independent response to English
                    imperial and colonial expectations of subserviency. McConnell deftly outlines how the upper Ohio
                    Indians also established their independence from the Iroquois Confederacy beginning in the 1750s,
                    reacting to local needs and competing challenges from Pennsylvania and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Out of this clearly articulated independence the Ohio Senecas, Delawares., and
                    Shawnees shaped Indian nations that have persisted to this day in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>, <country reg="ksu">Kansas</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>McConnell's book is a carefully researched study of the Ohio Indian world looked at from an
                    eastern perspective and based almost entirely on English sources. It follows closely Richard
                    White's <hi rend="i">The Middle Ground</hi> (1991), which views the Ohio country from the
                    west and is based on both French and English sources. While the <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-089-3-102"/>
                    French were out to missionize, trade, and intermarry with Indians, the English of the eighteenth
                    century were intent on commercial opportunities and land speculation. Everyday Indian life, which is
                    so much a part of French documents, is mostly lacking in English sources. As a result
                    McConnell's book, while trying to incorporate an Indian outlook into an account of this
                    complex period, focuses more on policy issues, and Indian leaders often sound like their European
                    American counterparts.</p>
            <p>After the defeat of <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in North America, British and colonial authorities had to come to terms with a much
                    larger Ohio country, which extended to the Wabash and beyond. While Mc-Connell is right that
                    Dunmore's War in 1774 ended accommodation between Indians and Americans on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, he is wrong to assert in his conclusion that "the Indians were given no role
                    in the new American empire in the west" (p. 281). Native resistance to inept American
                    treaties in the 1780s led directly to American accommodation that has shaped federal Indian policy
                    to this day. Article III of the Northwest Ordinance, the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790,
                    and John Marshall's Supreme Court decisions of the 1820s and 1830s were all results of
                    tribal insistence on land rights and sovereignty.</p>
            <p>McConnell's book should inspire more research on Indian-white relations in the upper Ohio
                    region, a story that can be continued to the present among remnants of tribes which remained in the
                    area. In his most readable chapter McConnell makes good use of archaeological evidence to show
                    changes in the everyday life of native peoples. Otherwise, the book will be of most interest to the
                    specialist.</p>

                    information so that motorists will behave like appreciative travelers rather than insensitive
                    tourists. Unfortunately, the text presents badly garbled and erroneous history, archaeology, and

            <p>Indiana fares rather poorly in this volume, possibly because the Hoosier state along with Ohio and
                    Illinois is considered to have only an Indian past, a view that ignores the vitality of the

                    Merrill D. Peterson in <hi rend="i">The Great Triumvirate</hi> [19871 traveled much the same
                    political terrain.) Clay spent a brief time in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s later appointment as Adams's secretary of state left the Kentuckian
                    open to "corrupt bargain" charges, and his decision, he later admitted, was a
                    lifelong mistake. Clay was in fact a good secretary of state, giving early thought to Latin American
                    interests and the possibility of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific in Central America. His
                    long Senate career commenced in the first <placeName>

            <p>Speaking in the <hi rend="i">American Commonwealth</hi> toward the end of the nineteenth century,
                    Lord James Bryce placed Clay at the top of the list of great American statesmen who did not make it
                    to the White House. In addition to his efforts in 1824 Clay ran a very poor second to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1832 and to James K. Polk in 1844. No other speaker, in fact, sought the presidency
                    so long or so passionately. Notwithstanding <placeName>

                    used his unique talents to patch the Union together, one must wonder if Clay would have handled the
                    presidency well. Would he, for example, have acquired the vast southwestern territory for the <placeName>

                    essay, index. $27.50.)</head>
            <p>Holt has written a comprehensive work on the placing-out system—that nineteenth and
                    early-twentieth century technique of moving destitute children from the cities to the
                    "west" to save them from lives of poverty. The title of her work refers to the
                    nickname applied to trains used to transport the children. Holt discusses the earliest uses of
                    placement in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and then the role of Charles Loring Brace of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Children's Aid Society in popularizing it. Other public and private agencies,
                    such as the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Children's Mission, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>'s Juvenile Asylum, and the Sisters of Charity, are also covered. The author
                    includes information on the placement process, describing, often in the words of the children, the
                    trips out and subsequent experiences. Two children sent to Indiana later became state governors.</p>
            <p>The growth of poverty in the Midwest and the creation of state boards and institutions were reasons
                    for the initial attacks on the system in the 1870s by states including Indiana. Other factors
                    contributing to placement's demise in the 1920s were state legislation limiting placements,
                    acceptance of the idea that preserving the family was critical in saving children, compulsory school
                    laws, and the shift from religious-based charities to the secular activities of social workers,
                    based on the new "scientific" concepts of sociology. Holt concludes that without
                    complete records it is impossible to determine the exact number of successful placements. Clearly
                    placing-out met a need, and equally clearly times and values changed, leading to its elimination.</p>
            <p>Holt slights the almost seven thousand adults placed out by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Children's Aid Society during Brace's lifetime although she discusses
                    adults placed by other agencies. The fact that placing adults ran counter to Brace's views
                    is a tantalizing inconsistency that should not be ignored. The material on Charlene J.

                    descriptions of the placing-out system and thoughtful analyses of the origins, modifications, and
                    demise of this intriguing part of the American welfare system.</p>

            <p>One of the transforming developments of the past century has been the widespread adoption of
                    electricity as a source of power and a means of lighting. In <hi rend="i">Electrifying America</hi>
                    David E. Nye deals with this change, focusing not on the technological or business history of the
                    electrical industry but on the impact electricity had on society and the way of life of the average
                    American. Dealing with the period 1880 to 1940, Nye demonstrates the powerful consequences of the
                    new technology in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>This book is of special interest to Hoosier readers because Nye's first chapter focuses on
                    the impact of electricity on America's <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Middletown</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
               </placeName>. Throughout
                    the book he relies on examples from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName> area, giving Indiana disproportionate attention in this national study. After surveying
                    the electrification of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Muncie</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Nye devotes chapters to the development of electric streetcar systems, the application
                    of the new source of power to manufacturing, the promotion of electrical appliances for the home,
                    and the movement for rural electrification. With an admirable breadth of vision, Nye examines such
                    diverse sources as paintings, popular literature, General Electric advertisements, and
                    world's fair promotional material, presenting what they have to say about electricity and
                    its impact on American life. His work is at times imaginative and always ambitious.</p>
            <p>Nye's ambitions, however, exceed his achievement. His individual chapters on transportation,
                    manufacturing, and the home are too brief to satisfy the specialist who would expect a volume on
                    each of these topics. Yet as a general summary the work also seems incomplete. Limiting the
                    book's effectiveness is a definite proelectricity bias. For example, Nye neglects the early
                    fears of the new technology that delayed its adoption. Hoosier President Benjamin Harrison and his
                    wife refused to turn on the new electric lights in the White House for fear of being shocked, and
                    they were not alone in their misgivings. Electricity not only excited the American love of progress,
                    it also represented a frightening force <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-089-3-107"/> that in the movies
                    would bring Frankenstein's monster to life. In the American imagination electricity was not
                    all light; it was darkness as well. Nye only occasionally touches on such perceptions in his account
                    of the blessings that electricity wrought.</p>
            <p>On the whole, Nye has offered a stimulating and expansive account that may not prove definitive but
                    might well stir further interest in his topic. It deserves to be read by all serious students of
                    American culture.</p>

            <p>It is a pity that landscape design has to be such a self-destructive work of art. As soon as it is in
                    place in its perfect form, it begins to grow, erode, require trimming, go to seed, succumb to
                    pollution and vermin, and otherwise change its form. Even the work of such famous landscape creators
                    as Frederick Law Olmsted survives as only a small sample of the original output. Such is also the
                    fate of Jens Jensen, and that is too bad. Not too many know the work of the Danish-born designer
                    outside his role as the landscape specialist for the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School," the group of architects who accepted the principles of design best
                    articulated by Frank Lloyd Wright. Jensen eagerly accepted the notion that the Midwest could produce
                    an architecture—both building and landscape—that incorporated the native
                    building materials, natural colors, and horizontal flatness of the region.</p>
            <p>But Jensen's importance transcends the role as a mere supplement to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School. As Robert E. Grese points out in this fascinating and important book, Jensen
                    also became a major American interpreter of the function of city parks, designing thirty-four of
                    them in <placeName>

                    </placeName> alone during the first part of his career. The relative newness of that city and its
                    parks during the first part of the century gave him the opportunity to shape the basic design and
                    purpose of the public sylvan retreats and playgrounds. That task, however, was made difficult by low
                    budgets and interference from politicians. Midway through his career Jensen shifted his attention
                    from public to more private urban, suburban, and wilderness spaces. A substantial practice of estate
                    landscaping included such wealthy clients as Henry Ford but thrived primarily among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s North Shore suburban elite. This income supported both Jensen's
                    untiring efforts to educate the public about the importance of the natural landscape that surrounded
                    them and his efforts <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-089-3-108"/> to protect reserves of relative pristine
                    beauty from the onslaught of automobiles and real estate speculators. Anyone who has enjoyed the
                    recreational areas at the Indiana Dunes or any one of several Illinois state parks enjoys a part of
                    Jensen's heritage.</p>
            <p>This is a good book. It is clearly organized, with introductory biographical sections that delineate
                    the origins of Jensen's mindset and the exciting <placeName>

                    </placeName> cultural milieu in which he worked. These sections are followed by discussions of
                    individual projects grouped into types, and the book concludes with an interpretive assessment of
                    Jensen's career. While organized like a catalog, it avoids reading like one.</p>

            <p>Carl Jung valued dreams because he believed in their ability to advance self-knowledge when viewed
                    within the context of one's life. In this seminal study James Guimond evaluates the
                    American Dream within a historical context as reflected and projected by photography.</p>
            <p>Chapter One, "Dreams and Documents," describes both the imagery to be analyzed and
                    the author's assumptions. Guimond's focus is "the relationship between
                    Americans' ideas about their nation and their ways of illustrating these ideas,
                    particularly with photographs, between 1899 and the mid-1980s" (p. 4). The author chose
                    photographs characterized as "civic" and "documentary." Civic
                    images illustrate "something the citizens might learn about themselves and their own
                    lives" (p. 4). Documentary photographs depict social conditions rather than explore
                    esoteric aesthetics and use representative imagery that "captures the drama of ordinary
                    people" with the intent "to overcome or dispose some false, superficial, or
                    stereotyped viewpoints about their ‘ordinary’ subjeots" (p. 5).
                    Guimond assumes that the camera is an extension of the mind and that the photographs he selected
                    are, citing Goya, products of a functional art intended "to banish harmful common beliefs
                    and to perpetuate … the sound testimony of truth" (p. 18).</p>
            <p>The balance of the book is an examination of the parallel abilities of photography and the American
                    Dream to empower societal transformation. The author contrasts the erosion of industrial
                    "white" education for African Americans and Native Americans at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s Hampton Institute as represented in Frances Johnston's <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-089-3-109"/> 1899 photographs. He investigates the relationship between child labor
                    and immigration and Lewis Hine's combined use of his photographs and advertising
                    methodology to evoke reform. He reveals the rise of documentary photography through the portrayal of
                    the Great Depression by the Farm Security Administration photographers and its subsequent
                    abandonment for photojournalism and the patriotic projections of the editors and photographers at
                        <hi rend="i">Life, Look</hi>, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Information Agency. He examines the views of America as wasteland by William Klein,
                    Robert Frank, and Diane Arbus in the 1950s and 1960s. Finally, he exposes the failures of the
                    American Dream in the 1970s and 1980s as represented in the work of four photographers: portraits of
                    suburban mediocrity by Bill Owens; the dehumanizing effects of industrialization and corporate life
                    by Chauncey Hare; the revolution against the American way of life in <placeName>
                        <country reg="nq">Nicaragua</country>
                    </placeName> by Susan Meiselas; and the homelessness resulting from deindustrialization in the
                    Midwest by Michael Williamson.</p>
            <p>Guimond effectively interweaves earlier points into subsequent discussions and excels at describing
                    material not illustrated within the book. Indiana occasionally enters the discourse, as in the
                    December, 1940, photoessay in <hi rend="i">Life</hi>, "A Small Town's Saturday
                    Night," featuring <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Completing the book is like awakening from a lucid yet discomforting dream. Guimond offers no
                    conclusions, leaving the reader to interpret the visual and verbal imagery he presents. What Guimond
                    does offer, however, is proof that photographs, as representations of life, are a means of
                    self-evaluation when lifted above the limitations of mere illustration.</p>

                    1865. During his three-year stint in the army DeWees marched more than five thousand miles through

                    Civil War army life: the interminable marching, the picket line duty, the food, the weather. Perhaps

                    accounts of battles vivid yet somber. DeWees's detailed descriptions of tactics and
                    logistics are also rather unusual, particularly for a private in the field. By DeWees's
                    calculations one hundred men left Ohio with him in Company D; only twenty-eight returned. His
                    journal is, in one sense, "just one more Civil War diary," but more than that it
                    serves as a tribute to both those who did and those who did not make it back. <hi rend="i">Lorna

                    disability and vice-presidential succession were two problems ignored by the framers of the American
                    Constitution. In this readable study John D. Feerick chronicles congressional remedies to these
                    problems and presents the "case for" the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. The author argues
                    that the amendment prevented a constitutional crisis during Watergate by enabling Gerald R. Ford to
                    become vice-president and then president. Feerick believes the amendment has been less effective
                    regarding presidential disability because presidents have been reluctant to invoke it. Indiana
                    historians will appreciate Feericks emphasis on Birch E. Bayh's leadership in securing
                    Senate approval of the amendment. <hi rend="i">Dean Kotlowski, Indiana University, <placeName>

            <p>The phrase "land office business" entered the language in the nineteenth century
                    and today still evokes the image of a boom—more business than one can handle. The records
                    of the federal land offices situated in Indiana are at the Archives, and they, too, represent more
                    than any one person can handle. They comprise the most detailed history of the settlement of the
                    state, providing information on Indiana pioneers and their origins; on legal descriptions of land
                    purchases; and on the economic development of the state. Despite their obvious value their unwieldy
                    arrangement and sheer mass are forbidding; consequently, their potential for research is negated by
                    the practical difficulties they represent.</p>

                    </placeName> Land Office Tract Books, 1823 to 1852. Helen Morrison, who retired in 1988 after
                    working nearly thirty years in the Archives, returned to work half-time in June to enter the
                    transcribed data onto a computerized database. Morrison is familiar with the Archives' land
                    office materials and believes the project can serve as a model for the indexing of records from
                    other land offices.</p>
            <p>Land records are tailor made for a database. As it is, they are immensely difficult to encompass
                    because they are primarily arranged by tract and by date, compiled in series of ledgers which run
                    concurrently and sequentially. Entering such material onto a computer will allow a researcher to
                    look quickly for mention of a particular individual or family, to generate statistical analyses of
                    masses of data, to follow patterns of settlement over time and geography—in short, to
                    change land office research from a test of endurance to a test of ideas.</p>

                    </placeName> district covered virtually all of the northeastern part of Indiana, and its tract books
                    have never been analyzed or indexed.</p>
            <p>The Archives' special exhibit at the 1992 State Fair commemorating 100 years at the 38th

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> included photographs of a Beatles performance at the 1964 Indiana State Fair. The
                    display, entitled "Centennial Celebration," drew <pb n="283" id="VAA4025-089-3-113"/> from the Archives' collection of several thousand state fair
                    photographs. In addition to the Beatles the exhibit featured midway crowds through the years, other
                    "Great Entertainers" who performed at the fair, and six Indiana governors
                    presiding at fair-related functions between the 1920s and the 1970s.</p>

                    </placeName> residents became Archives volunteers during July, 1992. Gene McCormick, formerly
                    corporate historian at Eli Lilly and Co., puts a lifelong interest in the Civil War to use as he
                    indexes Muster Rolls of the Indiana Legion, or Home Guard, from all ninety-two counties. Annette
                    Moore, a specialist in photograph preservation, is helping to index and identify photographs from
                    the Department of Natural Resources collection in the Archives.</p>
