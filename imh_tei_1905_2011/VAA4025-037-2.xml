                    the bill to aid in establishing agricultural colleges in each state of the Union. Yet the
                    representatives and senators of this area either opposed or supported with extreme reluctance the
                    Agricultural College Act of 1862 which provided for grants of land to endow such an institution in
                    each state.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Was this sheer partisan politics? Were the western congressmen
                    violating instructions and opposing the will of their constituents? Or was there something
                    inherently wrong in the land grant measure which they could not favor?</p>
            <p>American land policy has developed through a series of conflicts between opposing groups representing

                    <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-037-2-004"/> The group dominant at the outset looked upon the public lands
                    as a national treasure which should produce revenue for the government and thereby minimize the need
                    for taxation. It favored limited sales at high prices, wished to restrict the area open to
                    settlement and was not disturbed if speculators monopolized the public lands when they were opened
                    to sale. The agrarians opposed the revenue feature of the land system, wished to open the lands
                    freely to settlers, and resented the ease with which speculators acquired great tracts and seemed to
                    control land policy. As the agrarians, representative of the landless poor in the east and of the
                    small farmers of the West and South, grew in numbers and political power after 1800, they extorted
                    from a reluctant Congress, still revenue minded, a series of measures which gradually liberalized
                    land policy. The smallest unit of sale was reduced from 640 acres to forty; the minimum price was
                    lowered from $2.00 to $1.25 in 1820, and, in 1854, to twelve and one-half
                    cents an acre for certain lands; squatters were granted pre-emption rights which protected their
                    claims against speculators; and, finally, in 1862, the capstone of the agrarian demands was attained
                    in the Homestead Act which promised actual settlers a free grant of 160 acres.</p>
            <p>Running counter to this agrarian trend in land policy was the demand that the public lands be granted
                    to aid schools, highways, canals, railroads, and other public institutions. The lusty young nation,
                    growing in size and numbers at an amazing rate, was too impatient to wait for private initiative or
                    local government to meet these needs. The inadequacy of federal income and credit prevented money
                    grants, but the nation possessed a gigantic quantity of publicly owned land which might be used
                    instead of cash donations. From the outset of our national existence the policy had been followed,
                    although haltingly at first, of granting lands to aid in establishing common schools, endowing
                    normal schools and universities, erecting public buildings, constructing highways, canals and
                    finally railroads in the public land states and territories. Altogether hundreds of millions of
                    acres were given to these states and to private corporations as part of this grant-in-aid policy.
                    The grantees were expected to sell their lands at the government minimum price or better and of
                    course were interested in receiving the highest possible return from their donations. Such
                    grants-in-aid <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-037-2-005"/> seriously weakened the land reforms which the
                    agrarians were obtaining because they led to the creation of innumerable land agencies whose
                    disposal policies were the antithesis of that towards which the Federal Government was working.</p>
            <p>It was in the Lincoln administration that the free homestead and grants-in-aid policies clashed most
                    seriously. At the very moment that Congress adopted the Homestead Act, it was considering making
                    grants to western railroads which would take more than 100,000,000 acres out of the public domain.
                    Furthermore, thirteen days after the Homestead Bill became a law, Congress passed the Agricultural
                    College Act which offered to the states some 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 acres for the endowment of
                    agricultural and mechanical arts colleges. The west had always supported measures for grants-in-aid
                    but the College Act of 1862 differed so radically from those previously adopted that westerners were
                    forced into opposition despite their thorough approval of the object of the measure.</p>
            <p>Early in the nineteenth century, several attempts were made to establish schools of agriculture but
                    these small experiments were not particularly successful.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Being unable to
                    obtain sufficient support from individual states, agricultural leaders turned to the Federal
                    Government for aid. They argued that while industry and commerce had been aided in numerous ways,
                    for example by tariffs, patent laws, ship subsidies, river and harbor appropriations, and canal
                    grants, little or nothing had been done for agriculture.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The demand <list type="footnotes">

                    fostered by agricultural societies, farm journals, labor organizations and social reformers. By 1857
                    the movement had gained such wide support that Justin Smith Morrill, Representative in Congress from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vtu">Vermont</region>
                    </placeName>, was persuaded to introduce a bill to provide for grants of land to the states to aid
                    them in financing farmers' and laborers' colleges.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The bill
                    specified that for the purpose of establishing such a college each state would be given 20,000 acres
                    of public land for each senator and representative it had in Congress. In those western states where
                    there still existed public land, the selection could be made by the state or by officials of the
                    college to which the grant was given. Such states would be privileged to sell their lands at once or
                    to withhold them from market until they would bring higher prices. The states in which there was no
                    public domain were to receive scrip for the acreage to which they were entitled. The bill prohibited
                    the landless states from entering land with the scrip and required them to sell it to assignees who
                    could use it to enter "any of the unappropriated lands of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> subject to sale at private entry at one dollar and twenty-five cents, or less, per
                    acre." The congressional debates on the Morrill Bill bring out clearly the conflict of
                    philosophies over land policy. Support for the measure <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>House establishments, and for Military Academies and Colleges, and extensive grants of

                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi> Much controversial writing has been devoted to the question as to
                            the authorship of, or the responsibility for, the Agricultural College Act. Professor Earle
                            D. Ross has reviewed the controversy in an article which is a model of historical
                            investigation and restraint, "The ‘Father’ of the Land-Grant
                            College," <hi rend="i">Agricultural History</hi> (April, 1938), XII,
                            151–186. To the student of land policy the controversy appears to be of little
                            importance for practically all the features of the Act of 1862 were carried over from
                            earlier measures. Agricultural colleges were not new in 1862. Land grants had been given to
                            endow universities in the colonial and early national period and every public land state had
                            received a donation for the endowment of a university, or "seminary of
                            learning." The actual method of aiding the proposed agricultural colleges was
                            borrowed from the "Dix Bill" of 1854, which is described below. The
                            Morrill Act, so far as the land donation policy is concerned, contained not one new feature
                            which had not been discussed for years prior to 1857.</item>

            <p>Since 1789 the South had clung tenaciously to a narrow interpretation of the constitution. Its
                    attitude was based on fear lest an aggressive majority in the North, if not shackled by
                    constitutional limitations, adopt a series of measures which would place the south permanently in
                    bondage to its more powerful rival. The constitutional susceptibilities of the South were especially
                    keen in the matter of disposing of the public lands. The section maintained that free homesteads to
                    settlers, free grants to railroads, and donations to agricultural and mechanical colleges were all
                    contrary to the spirit and letter of the constitution. Listen to some of the classic statements

                    directed their severest strictures not at the revenue provisions but at the wide open character of
                    the land laws which permitted capitalists and incorporated companies to purchase unlimited amounts
                    of public land anywhere in the West. Since the first settlement in America, capitalists and land
                    companies had been buying land in extensive quantities and when settlers reached the areas so
                    acquired they found no land available except at speculators' prices. Despite the growing
                    liberality of the land laws, speculators continued to forestall the settlers and prevented the
                    development of a democratic land system in many areas. Listen to a writer in the <placeName>

            <p>The speculators' holdings not only retarded local development but forced the wide dispersal
                    of population, made necessary the extension of highways and railroads into thinly populated areas,
                    and raised the costs of local government. Furthermore, it was difficult to collect taxes from
                    absentee owners as a result of which the resident proprietors had to bear an unfair share of the tax
                    burden. Speculators frequently found it desirable to place tenants upon their lands to protect them
                    from being plundered and to begin improving them, and the west deeply resented the intrusion of an
                    institution it felt to be un-American and undemocratic. More than anything else the westerners
                    disliked the fact that it was the improvements made by settlers in the vicinity of land owned by
                    speculators which gave value to the latters' holdings. The speculators' profits,
                    whether from rents or sales, were drained off to the East and contributed nothing to western

            <p>Another fundamental objection to the Morrill Bill was that it would benefit the older states at the
                    expense of the newer ones. As the grants would not be based on actual need but on population, the
                    densely settled and wealthiest states would receive the largest grants and the poorest, the least
                    developed and the most needy would receive the smallest grants. <placeName>

            <p>All these arguments might well have led the advocates of the measure to consider the counter proposal
                    made by Timothy O. Howe of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. Senator Howe urged that Congress grant to the states out of the land revenues the sum
                    of $30,000, instead of 30,000 acres of land, for each Congressional representative and
                    senator to which the states were entitled.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Unfortunately, Congress was as yet
                    unable to bring itself to make financial grants for education and consequently resorted to the long
                    standing custom of using the public lands, regardless of the direful predictions of the western
                    representatives.</p>
            <p>Western opposition to, and eastern support for, the agricultural college bill was chiefly owing to
                    the fact that it included a new principle of land distribution. This was that land in one state
                    should be given for the benefit of another. Hitherto, the Federal Government had made grants to
                    states and territories of land within their borders for education and local improvements. Such
                    donations had been a method by which individual states were permitted to share in the administration
                    of the land and they had been given, in part, to quiet opposition in the west to the rather slow
                    process by which the Federal land policy was being liberalized. As the eastern states had
                    administered their own lands, new states coming into the Union were inclined to resent Federal <list type="footnotes">

                    Complete cession was never achieved though some of the newer states were to acquire considerable
                    portions of their lands. Had the agricultural college bill followed precedent by providing for
                    grants of land only to states in which there were still public lands available, thereby avoiding the
                    use of scrip, it would have received the unqualified support of all westerners. But this would have
                    deprived the East of any direct benefit from the measure and eastern Representatives were insistent
                    that land grants should be given to all states, regardless of the effect such a policy would have on
                    the land system.</p>
            <p>Representatives of the eastern and non-public land states had early advocated donations of public
                    lands to aid various enterprises within their boundaries but without notable success.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> When prejudices against the liberal donation of land for worthy purposes seemed to be
                    breaking down in the fifties, Congress was asked to make grants to aid the states in caring for the
                    indigent insane. This measure came close to enactment in 1854. Dorothea Dix, one of that remarkable
                    coterie of women reformers who did so much to arouse Americans to the existence of major social
                    abuses in the nineteenth century, created so strong a sentiment for federal aid for the care of the
                    insane that members of Congress dared not resist it, regardless of their doubts as to the
                    constitutionality of such a measure. A bill to grant to the states 10,000,000 acres of public land
                    to be apportioned "in the compound ratio of geographic area and representation …

            <p>The agricultural college bill was actually more unpalatable to the West than the Dix Bill. The former
                    provided for grants of land to the states solely on the basis of population while the latter
                    provided for grants according to the area and the population of the states. Under the Dix Bill the
                    western states because of their greater size would have received a fair share of the lands it was
                    proposed to grant but under the Morrill Bill the East's share would be disproportionately
                    large. Efforts to substitute the donation ratio of the Dix Bill for that of the Morrill Bill
                        failed.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The conflict of ideas between those who supported land grants for western institutions and those who
                    favored reserving the public lands for actual settlers was never settled. Opposition to grants for

                    was especially strong in the West and the bars were let down only once—in 1862. There was
                    also developing in the West before the Civil War a feeling that the railroad land grant policy had
                    gone too far, as is evidenced by a memorial of the <placeName>

                    Congress should not be passed because it would further land monopoly and harm settlers'
                    interests. Although railroad land grants were to be made until 1871, there were many people in the
                    West who had grave doubts as to the wisdom of the policy.</p>

            <p>By 1857 the West was coming to question the wisdom of the entire public land system based as it was
                    on the revenue concept. Revenue meant sale to settlers or speculators and when settlers lacked funds
                    they had to depend on loan sharks or speculators to buy for them. The preëmption law had
                    not been of any assistance to penniless frontiersmen unable to buy their claims; neither had the
                    claim association been able to protect the squatter beyond the opening of the land sale. The result
                    was, according to contemporary estimates, that between a third and a half of the farms in the West
                    were mortgaged.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> To relieve the embattled squatters when it seemed that a free
                    homestead measure could not be passed because of southern opposition, the West suggested that no
                    further lands be opened to sale. The next step it took was to demand that all public lands be closed
                    to entry save by settlers.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> Such steps were too advanced for the East and South
                    but, if adopted, they would have made the agricultural college scrip of little or no value. It is
                    clear that the West wanted no more land to pass into eastern control whether it was individual or
                    institutional</p>
            <p>The strongest support for the Morrill Bill naturally came from the eastern states which were to
                    receive the largest grants under it. This section had always maintained that the public lands
                    belonged to the nation and should be used for the general welfare rather than for the benefit of the
                    particular states in which they lay. The income from the sale of lands went into the federal
                    treasury, from which the eastern states derived benefit, and they were naturally reluctant to
                    countenance any reduction in land revenues. Opposition to land reform, consequently, had been strong
                    in the east prior to 1850, but thereafter it subsided as this section saw the advantages which would
                    come to it from a rapidly developing west. Many easterners were now ready to support free homesteads
                    and liberal land grants to railroads in exchange for support for high tariffs, favorable immigration
                    laws, a national banking system and ship subsidies. <list type="footnotes">

                    colleges. In the Morrill Bill the East hoped to secure a part of the public lands and also to pay
                    off its obligation to the farmers for their support of the major legislation of the Lincoln
                    administration.</p>
            <p>Horace Greeley typified the Republican Party with two of its major planks for protective tariffs and
                    free lands. Greeley detested speculation in lands and took great pleasure in condemning measures
                    which made possible easy acquisition of land by non-residents. His travels through the west had
                    given him a realistic picture of the problems of that area and a deep sympathy for the debt ridden
                    farmers who were desperately striving to secure title to their claims. No man dealt harder blows in
                    the campaign for the adoption of the free homestead policy. But his zeal for agricultural colleges
                    overcame his realistic understanding of the land system. He called the agricultural college measure
                    "a very moderate concessions to the Old States," and chided the West for not being
                    willing to give the East this act in return for free homesteads and railroad land grants.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The Homestead Act, he thought, would virtually end land speculation; he
                    failed to see that the agricultural college measure provided another opportunity for speculators,
                    and he was blind to the obvious conflict between the principles of the two measures.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Representative Morrill undertook to answer the arguments of the opposition. He paid his respects to
                    the members of the state rights school as follows:<hi rend="sup">41</hi> "I know very well
                    that when there is a lack of arguments to be brought against the merits of a measure, the
                    Constitution is fled to as an inexhaustible arsenal of supply." Less satisfactory was his
                    reply to the arguments of the western representatives. He was convinced that the scrip
                    "will go into the hands of bona fide settlers, because such will be the only purchares to
                    be found, unless a depreciation of price, and these will be obtained by the several states disposing
                    of their scrip on a credit and retaining the lien on the land. Such an arrangement will not
                    certainly be to the disadvantage <list type="footnotes">

            <p>If the old fashioned views of the strict constructionists were losing their hold upon the North, they
                    were still cherished by James Buchanan. He agreed with Mason and Clay that the agricultural college
                    bill would destroy the old balance of power between the states and the Federal Government and he
                    therefore stood squarely with the South in unalterable opposition to the measure. But Buchanan was a
                    Democrat and the Democratic Party had always depended for much of its support upon the frontier
                    West. He therefore embodied in his veto message the view earlier stated so forcibly by Pugh of <placeName>

                            large tracts of the public land and hold them for speculative purposes. The low price to
                            which this land scrip will probably be reduced will tempt speculators to buy it in large
                            amounts and locate it on the best lands belonging to the Government. The eventual
                            consequence must be that the men who desire to cultivate the soil will be compelled to
                            purchase these very lands at rates much higher than the price at which they could be

            <p>In 1862 the agricultural college bill was introduced into Congress again, this time with the amount
                    of land to be granted to each state increased to 30,000 acres for each Representative and Senator in
                    Congress. Again the northeast which stood to gain so much from it overwhelmingly supported it.
                    Southern opposition was now silenced but the outcry from the frontier states was still shrill. Many
                    westerners, more of them than in 1858 and 1859 when the issue was involved in politics, were torn
                    between their desire to support a democratic system of higher education for the farmers and workers
                    and their fears that the measure would contribute further to land speculation and land engrossment.
                    They made a last desperate effort to amend the bill to limit the amount of land individuals could
                    acquire with the scrip to 640 acres. The Senate adopted the amendment by the close vote of

                    </placeName> than to those of Jefferson. It was also true that he, like others, regarded the

                            would be of aid to speculators and maintained that the revenue feature was not important.
                            But worse still, he practically said that the votes of western Democrats were given because
                            of their subservience to the "Slave Power." This is scarcely fair to those
                            who fere sincerely opposed to the measure but it shows how much Greeley permitted his hatred
                            of slavery to becloud his judgment. <hi rend="i">

            <p>It is not difficult to account for the opposition of the members of Congress from Indiana and <placeName>

                    acquisition of land by speculators through the use of scrip since their public lands were
                    practically gone. Moreover, they were to receive generous subsidies compared <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-037-2-025"/> with the newer public land states. Yet, their representatives had not
                    as yet assimilated the eastern attitude sufficiently to make them forget their frontier prejudices
                    concerning the public land system. In these two states were great tracts of land owned by resident
                    and non-resident speculators and landlords whose opposition to expenditures for roads, schools,
                    bridges, and other public construction and whose extensive and unimproved holdings retarded the
                    development of some of the richest counties. In Indiana the Ellsworths, the "Yale

                    estates which would put to shame many principalities and duchies abroad. Some of these great estates
                    were only slightly developed; on others dwelt tenants in wretched hovels.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
                    Absentee ownership blighted great areas of fertile land, prevented the development of an independent
                    proprietor class, introduced what many considered an un-American
                    system—tenancy—led to the abuse of the land and early soil depletion and fed
                    the fires of sectional hatred and social discontent.<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

                    over a bill to facilitate the collection of rents by giving landlords a lien on the crops of
                    tenants. Believers in the democratic way of life were shocked at the introduction of such a measure
                    and succeeded in defeating its enactment until 1881. Until then, the issue cropped up in almost
                    every session, producing many acrimonious debates between those legislators who seemed to represent
                    the interests of the landlords and those who were sympathetic to the increasing tenant class.<hi rend="sup">73</hi>

            <p>Senator Joseph A. Wright, of Indiana, a real son of the soil, had a better understanding of western
                    farm problems thany any other member of Congress. He spoke from experience when he observed:
                    "Nothing is so disadvantageous to a new State as to have a large amount of its land held by
                    non-residents prior to its settlement."<hi rend="sup">76</hi> He deplored tenancy,<hi rend="sup">77</hi> a product of land speculation, and frequently condemned unsound farm
                    practices which were already becoming associated with tenant operation of land.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Neglect of crop rotation, too much dependence upon corn for the major crop, the failure to
                    keep cattle and to manure the land called forth his scathing denunciation. Education, he believed,
                    would lead to better farm practices. In 1851, when governor of Indiana, he urged the establishment

                    delegation who voted for the Agricultural College Act in 1862.</p>
            <p>Unlike the long series of land reforms which had been adopted since 1800, the Agricultural College
                    Act cannot be considered a western product. It was one of the few land bills of the mid-nineteenth
                    century which was forced on the west by a combination of older states having no federal lands. The
                    West won its homestead demand, in part, but suffered defeat on the Agricultural College Act.</p>
            <p>Over a long period of years the Federal Government had devised a land system which, imperfect though
                    it was, yet worked fairly satisfactorily in the physical details of surveying, advertising, selling
                    and patenting the lands. Complaints were directed at its administration, at the honesty of many of
                    its officers, and at its inefficiency, but, despite all, its record was fairly clear of major
                    scandals. This could not be said of state land policies by the most charitable critic. Large
                    quantities of public lands had already been granted the states for education, swamp drainage, canals
                    and railroads and the administration of these lands was notoriously fraudulent and wasteful. But
                    worse still, the new principal embodied in the Agricultural College Act of granting to the older
                    states, land or scrip which could only be located in the west made it necessary for twenty-seven
                    different states to provide for the management and sale of this scrip.</p>

            <p>The story of the disposal of the agricultural college scrip by the states is one of neglect,
                    carelessness, incapacity and something closely akin to corruption.<hi rend="sup">87</hi> Political
                    morality had reached such a low level in the sixties that the possession of millions of acres of
                    scrip by the states seemed to call forth a concerted effort by spoilsmen to make use of it for their
                    personal benefit. The manner in which the <placeName>

                    </placeName> scrip was sold illustrates this point. In March, 1866, Cyrus Woodman, a dealer in land
                    and scrip, stated that he had found the governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> and a member of his council friendly to him and through them had learned the bids of
                    all competitors. Woodman was permitted to submit a late bid after the others had been opened and, as
                    a result, secured 60,000 acres at 52 1/2 <hi rend="i">cents an acre,</hi> which was the lowest price
                        paid.<hi rend="sup">88</hi> In July, 1866, Woodman was negotiating for the <placeName>

                    its sale. That the same tactics were to be used in the negotiations is seen by the following
                        statement:<hi rend="sup">89</hi> "It may be safe &amp; expedient to offer him say
                    $250 to let us know, (in case of competition) what bid from us will secure the
                    scrip." The Woodmans were unsuccessful in <placeName>

            <p>In most cases sale of the scrip brought in disappointingly small returns. The states were expected to
                    set in operation agricultural colleges and for that purpose were to use only the interest upon the
                    endowment derived from the sale of scrip. Consequently, there was a strong incentive to turn the
                    scrip into cash quickly. Those states which acted promptly in accepting the scrip dumped it on the
                    market in 1864 and 1865 at a time when the number of land entries being made was relatively small
                    and in such quantities that the price fell to as low as forty-two cents an acre. Indiana, for
                    example, sold its 390,000 acres of scrip for fifty-three cents an acre; <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, through Cornell University, did somewhat better, selling a portion as high as
                    $1.00 an acre but only because it waited until the market had cleared to some extent.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three states sought to evade that provision of the Act which stated that the scrip should be sold by
                    the states and not used by them to enter lands in the West. The first of these, <placeName>

            <p>The meager returns received from the land and scrip were discouraging and supporters of vocational
                    education came to regret that they had not received a cash subsidy in place of the land or scrip
                    donations. The endowments were quite inadequate and, in consequence, the early history of many of
                    the agricultural colleges is marked with promising beginnings, followed by quick retrenchments. The
                    states at the outset were not prepared to support the struggling institutions except by small
                    appropriations for buildings and additional federal assistance was sought. In 1872 the National
                    Agricultural Convention representing the land grant colleges and agricultural societies, met in <placeName>

                    </placeName> for the purpose of securing a further donation from Congress. There was some
                    controversy among the members as to the best proposal to urge upon Congress; some members like
                    William W. Folwell of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, favored equal donations of land or scrip to all states regardless of population;
                    others favored an additional donation based on population as in the Morrill Act. The discussion
                    showed that few—whether westerners or easterners—were satisfied with the
                    grants of land and scrip the states had received. The western states, it was pointed out, had
                    received little land, though some of them had obtained high prices for their tracts by withholding
                    them from sale for a few years. The eastern states had received large scrip acreages but had been
                    forced to sell at low prices. Cornell University's experience, which already promised much,
                    was envied by all. The members pressed hard for a grant of lands or cash, but were unsuccessful.<hi rend="sup">96</hi>

                    accumulation of land by eastern speculators and that the forced sale by the eastern states of their
                    scrip would depress the prices to such low levels that small benefit would accrue to the newly
                    established colleges. Unlike the military land warrants, previously referred to, the agricultural
                    college scrip could not be used by preëmptors to secure their small claims. This
                    restriction made the scrip of no use to a large class of settlers and depressed its price. Also, the
                    scrip had to compete with free homesteads which further reduced the demand for it. When, therefore,
                    in 1864 and 1865, the northern states began to sell their scrip they found they were selling in a
                    buyers' market and that the chief demand came from speculators.</p>
            <p>The vast amount of military land warrants issued to ex-soldiers between 1847 and 1855 had prevented
                    any dealer in warrants or any combination from controlling the market and pegging the price. The
                    warrants were issued to soldiers in all parts of the country and, in most cases, were sold to
                    agents, banks, or land dealers. They were bought and sold on a small margin by brokers and their
                    price was regularly quoted in the large dailies. The agricultural college scrip, in contrast, was
                    issued to twenty-seven states which, in most instances, endeavored to sell their entire amount in
                    one deal. Bids for small quantities were not encouraged but the broker who could take the full
                    issue, even though on time, was favored. The result was that most of the scrip was acquired by a
                    small number of dealers, and by 1866 one man had come to control the market.</p>

                    individual states. To secure the scrip entries they wanted before the maximum was reached, lumbermen
                    and eastern speculators frantically pushed their land hunting expeditions and rushed their
                    selections to the land offices for entry. In 1867 the maximum was reached in <placeName>

            <p>Such large scale land engrossment of public lands led the anti-monopolists to introduce a bill into

            <p>The Act of 1868 naturally depreciated the value of the scrip which led to demands for its repeal by
                    representatives of the eastern states. Ezra Cornell, still holding for Cornell University 100,000
                    scrip acres which he now found difficulty in selling, made one of his frequent trips to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to secure the repeal of the obnoxious act. He induced Roscoe Conkling to support repeal
                    in an able speech in which he stated that the restrictions on the scrip had depreciated its value
                    from $1 to sixty cents an acre. Conkling appealed in behalf of Cornell University and two
                    or three other colleges which still held their scrip for the repeal of the restrictions. Cornell and
                    Conkling won converts for repeal but when they approached Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana, they
                    found they had caught a tartar for Hendricks replied by getting off a typical anti-monopoly speech,
                    opposing repeal, wherein he said:<hi rend="sup">104</hi>

                    colleges but they did the South a service in withholding the scrip from sale for a time. The

            <p>The Agricultural College Act has been overrated by those writers who have attributed to it the
                    beginnings of numerous state agricultural colleges which, in fact, were underway prior to 1862. It
                    did, however, give a great impetus to the establishment of state colleges wherein applied science
                    was ultimately, if not immediately, taught. Its major historical significance rests on its
                    contribution to educational progress in the <placeName>

                    justification. Yet, that section which opposed it most consistently has doubtless enjoyed the most
                    benefit from the colleges it was instrumental in founding and endowing.</p>

            <p>The general direction of this travel is shown by the map of Lewis Evans (1755), carrying the title,
                        <hi rend="i">A General Map of the Middle British Colonies in America. Sayer &amp;
                        Bennett's Map</hi> (<placeName>

                    </placeName>, on to Piquatown and thence to Fort Pitt. It is extremely difficult to localize the
                    routes of travel from these maps when the distortion of the map (a common characteristic of early
                    maps) is taken into consideration. The fact that there were several towns at various times during
                    this period named "Piqua" and that there might have been confusion as to G. Wiaut
                    and L. Wiaut<hi rend="sup">12</hi> adds to the difficulty. As an example, there was an Indian
                    village, Piqua, near the present site of Xenia, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, which doubtless was on or near the Fort Chartres-Fort Pitt Path, while the map maker
                    in 1776 might have still been placing Pickawillany, occasionally mistaken for Piqua, on his map and
                    drawing the trail through this spot. The destruction of the stockade and the Indian village occurred
                    in 1752, however, and they were never rebuilt.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Hutchin's Map</hi> of 1764 locates "Old Lower Shawnee Town"

                    since it was the privilege of the chiefs who signed the treaty to accompany the surveyors of the

            <p>Among the most influential names in Indiana's educational history is that of Dunn. So
                    closely is this name interwoven with the founding and maintenance of colleges throughout the state
                    that it is of special interest to students of early Indiana history. Public spirited and generous in
                    the highest degree, members of this family did their work in such a quiet and unassuming manner that
                    few people today are aware of how freely the Dunns gave of their time and money.</p>
            <p>Five prominent institutions of higher learning, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, Earlham College, Indiana University and Purdue University, are especially
                    thankful for the help they received from the Dunn family when they were struggling for existence.</p>
            <p>The founder of this family in America was James Dunn who was born in County Down, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ie">Ireland</country>
                    </placeName>. About 1749, he married Martha Long, daughter of John Long, and in 1762 settled in
                    Augusta County, afterward Rockingham County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. He enlisted in Rockingham County for the Revolutionary War. Sometime between 1784 and
                    1788, he migrated to Jessamine County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, where he died about 1808, aged eighty-two years.</p>
            <p>One of the sons of James and Martha (Long) Dunn was Samuel Dunn, who was born in 1750 and died at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1802. In 1775, he married Elinor Brewster, the daughter of James and Elinor
                    (Williamson) Brewster. Among their children were Williamson, Samuel and Nathaniel.</p>
            <p>At an age when most men are contented with their surroundings, Williamson Dunn, son of Samuel and
                    Elinor (Brewster) Dunn, made a decision which was to make him one of the foremost figures of early
                    Indiana. He hated slavery, so, in a bold stroke, he and his brothers severed their home ties and
                    came to Indiana.</p>
            <p>Williamson Dunn was a striking figure. It is no wonder that he could inspire people to great
                    endeavors. Five feet, ten and one-half inches tall, he was very strong, muscular and fair of
                    complexion, with piercing Irish blue eyes.</p>
            <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-037-2-048"/>
            <p>In the year 1806, he married Miriam Wilson, and, in 1808, he came to the spot which is now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Standing upon the wooded bluff, overlooking the beautiful <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> River, Williamson Dunn was so impressed with the magnificent scenery and wonderful
                    possibilities of the place that he determined to make it his home. Accordingly, he secured a large
                    tract of land there. The following year he brought his young wife and two small sons to their new
                    home in the Indiana wilderness.</p>
            <p>For three years, Williamson Dunn lived in comparative seclusion, clearing his land and erecting
                    buildings. In 1811, when William Henry Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory and
                    Commander-in-Chief of the military force in the territory, called upon him to serve as Judge of the
                    Court of Common Pleas of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson County</region>
                    </placeName> and to act as Justice of the Peace, he accepted.</p>
            <p>After the commencement of the War of 1812, Indians, friendly to the British, became dangerous to the
                    scattered settlers of Indiana Territory. It was in this period that the terrible Pigeon Roost
                    Massacre occurred about twenty miles from Judge Dunn's home. Congress authorized the
                    raising of four companies of Mounted Rangers on the frontier. Judge Dunn raised one of these
                    companies and was commissioned captain by President Madison. The four companies were mustered into
                    service at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on April 13, 1813. Captain Dunn's company was sent on a number of
                    expeditions against the Indians. It was largely due to his efforts that the region around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> did not suffer serious raids. Captain Dunn was mustered out of the service at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on March 23, 1814.</p>
            <p>At the close of his military service, Captain Dunn returned to his home and resumed labor upon his
                    farm. It was at this time that he and his wife made a profession of religion and joined the
                    Presbyterian Church at Charles-town, Indiana. Later, he was influential in organizing the
                    Presbyterian Church at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He became a ruling elder, which office he held during the rest of his life. In 1823
                    Rev. John Finley Crowe, then pastor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church, built a stone "meeting house" on land donated by Judge Dunn
                    for that purpose.</p>
            <p>Judge Dunn was appointed by President <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName> to be register of the land office at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1823, this <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-037-2-049"/> office was moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Judge Dunn and Major Whitlock, who was receiver of the land office, entered the
                    land upon which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> is situated.</p>
            <p>For a number of years after the founding of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was the dream of some of its people that a College should be founded in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> country. At last, on November 21, 1832, nine men met at a little brick house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the home of James Thomson, the pastor of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbyterian Church, to found <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College. Of the nine men who gathered there, five were ministers, three were elders,
                    and one was a layman. They were: James Thomson, John Steele Thomson, James A. Carnahan, Edmond O.
                    Hovey and John Ellis, Presbyterian ministers; John Gilliland, John McConnell and Hezekiah Robertson,
                    elders in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Presbyterian Church, and Bradford King, a layman from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                    York</region>
               </placeName>. They elected the following men as trustees of the new college: James
                    Thomson, John Steele Thomson, James A. Carnahan, Edmond O. Hovey, and John Gilliland, who were at
                    the meeting, and also Williamson Dunn, Samuel G. Lowry and Martin M. Post who were not present.</p>
            <p>Williamson Dunn had donated fifteen acres of woodland for the college. On November 22, 1832, the
                    morning after the meeting, the ministers and one or two of the other founders walked north through
                    the woods to the chosen site. Kneeling in the snow that had fallen during the night the men
                    dedicated the ground to the <hi rend="i">Father,</hi> the Son, and the <hi rend="i">Holy Ghost</hi>
                    for a Christian college. The prayer was made by John Ellis. The first building of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> College, called Forest Hall, was completed in 1833, and the first class was taught in
                    it on December 3, 1833, by the first professor, Caleb Mills. Elihu W. Baldwin was the first
                    president.</p>
            <p>The Hannas, Dunns, Wilsons, and Professors Hovey, Mills, and Thomson were among the earliest settlers
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. William Offield was the first settler in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> County, and another early settler was Henry Ristine, a lieutenant in Captain Williamson
                    Dunn's Company of Rangers. In the same year that Williamson Dunn moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Henry Ristine also moved his family there from <placeName>

            <p>In 1829, Judge Dunn had laid off land on his farm for a village which was called South <placeName>

                    </placeName> Academy and college buildings. He also gave fifty acres towards the endowment of the

                    daughter of George Grundy, II, who had married Eleanor Burch. Samuel Dunn, Jr., lived on a farm
                    which is now. occupied by buildings of Indiana University. On a part of the grounds is an old
                    cemetery, called "God's Acre," in which members of Samuel Dunn's
                    family are buried. When the Dunn land was conveyed to the state for university purposes by Moses
                    Dunn, grandson of Samuel Dunn, Jr., a special act was passed by the state legislature setting aside
                    this small cemetery for the Dunn family for all time to come. Two of Elizabeth (Grundy)
                    Dunn's sisters are also buried there; namely, Mrs. William Alexander and Mrs. Samuel Irvin.

            <p>The creation of the Northwest Territory by the Continental Congress in 1787 was followed about three
                    years later by the creation of its sister Southwest Territory, by the first Congress under the
                    federal Constitution. The Act of Congress of May 26, 1790, provided for the government of the
                    western domain ceded by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>

                    </placeName> in the previous year and upon the same basis as the Northwest Territory, with one
                    highly significant exception: slavery in the latter was prohibited, but <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> in her Act and deed of cession imposed the condition that slavery should never be
                    abolished in the ceded territory.</p>
            <p>The name given by statute to the new Territory was awkward and
                    misleading—"Territory of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                    </placeName>, was to be included within its bounds. Really, its area was that covered by the later

                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>—the first of the Union to be transformed from a territory into a state.</p>
            <p>The creation of the Southwest Territory aroused the fears of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> which was watchful of her claims to parts of the region and jealous of this advance of
                    the jurisdiction and power of the federal government towards her possessions to the south. The
                    Spanish authorities in <placeName>

                    </placeName> began to cultivate the southern Indian tribes and to encourage them to resist the
                    settlement of the new Territory, especially west of the Cumberland.</p>
            <p>The Northwest Territory experienced a like resistance from the Indians of that area. The flow of
                    white settlers into the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> Country was held back, in large measure, in consequence. A campaign, and yet a second
                    and a third had been unsuccessfully launched against the redmen. The last, St. Glair's
                    expedition of 1791, had for its purpose the overawing of the Indians by the construction of a
                    barrier chain of forts from Fort <placeName>

                    nearby States and on the Southwest Territory, each for a battalion of troops to serve under him. The
                    call on the militia of the last named Territory was arranged at the seat of government by the War

                    General St. Clair failed; he was often compelled to lie on a litter and be carried. The men suffered
                    from chills and fevers. Seven or eight miles became a day's march. Mismanagement of the
                    commissariat caused food to grow scarce, and as a result troops deserted by scores. At last on
                    November 3, the army, reduced by disease and desertion to fourteen hundred, reached a small stream,
                    a tributary of the <placeName>

                    the militia were sent across the stream to encamp while the regulars camped in two lines on its
                    nearer, or southern bank, about a quarter of a mile in the rear of the militia. The first regiment
                    of regulars was sent back towards Fort Jefferson" to arrest deserters and bring up
                    supplies.</p>

            <p>George S. Cottman died at his home near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, Sunday afternoon, May 18. He was the founder of this <hi rend="i">Magazine,</hi> beginning its publication the first quarter of 1905 under the name <hi rend="i">Indiana Quarterly Magazine of History</hi>—"Devoted to the Past for the
                    Sake of the Present." The last phrase was changed in the first number of Volume II, March,
                    1906, to "Devoted to the Preservation of Local History." The name of William E.
                    Henry, state librarian in 1905, was carried on the cover during that year as manager—Mr.
                    Cottman listing himself as editor and publisher. A few individuals besides Mr. Henry gave
                    encouragement and advanced subscriptions, but Mr. Cottman himself did almost all of the work and
                    incurred almost all of the expense involved in the publication.</p>
            <p>The spirit in which Mr. Cottman undertook the publication of a quarterly magazine devoted to Indiana
                    history is best put in his own words from his prospectus repeated in his first editorial,
                    "Our Reasons for Being:" <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>To the members of these [historical] societies and to others who think an interest in our
                            past worth promoting as of value to the present, then, we make an appeal. We have launched
                            the magazine at a venture and at some sacrifice in the faith that if we can make a worthy
                            showing the support will be forthcoming. It is not our disposition to resort to any foisting
                            or booming method. We assume that the class we desire and hope to reach will take our effort
                            exactly at its worth, and that if every page we present to them is full of matter that
                            justifies itself no better advertisement will be needed. For the first year, if need be, we
                            are willing to make no account of managerial and editorial labors if the actual cost of
                            publishing, distributing and associated expenses are covered.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The old-fashioned cover and title page, designed by Mr. Cottman, carried a border both crude and
                    elaborate, representing many but not all of his special interests: miniatures of Little Turtle,
                    William H. Harrison, Robert Owen, "Ben" Harrison; Indian scenes; log cabin;
                    Conestoga wagon; powder horn, axe, musket; a yoke of oxen; a primitive locomotive; a little mill;
                    etc. Mr. Henry's name disappeared from the title page at the end of the first year (he
                    became librarian of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>), and Mr. Cottman continued the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> without much help for two
                    years more. His intention to give up the unequal struggle at the end of 1907 <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-037-2-059"/> was abandoned when the Executive Committee of the Indiana Historical
                    Society "authorized [him] to expend not to exceed $150.00 to insure the
                    continued publication of the Indiana Quarterly Magazine of History." The development and
                    expansion of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> was insured when Indiana University in 1913 took it over
                    and contributed the services of Logan Esarey as editor. The support by the Historical Society
                    assumed the form of a subscription at reduced rate for each of its members. To Mr. Cottman, however,
                    belongs the credit for the creation of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and for its continuance
                    through the first difficult years. With the exception of a period of absence from Indiana in 1909,
                    1910, and 1911, he was editor, and virtual manager from 1905 to 1912, inclusive. All the issues of
                    the years 1906 to 1912, inclusive, and the March issue of 1913 were published by Edward J. Hecker of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Without formal historical training, Mr. Cottman had the most essential qualities of a
                    historian—appreciation of what had been done in the past, passion for accuracy, and
                    willingness to go through tedious research. He was for years a contributor of historical articles to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers: he was the author of <hi rend="i">Indiana—Its History,
                        Constitution, and Present Government,</hi> and of the <hi rend="i">Centennial History and
                        Scrap-book of Indiana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For some years, ill health kept him in retirement at the home of his son, Evan W. Cottman, on the
                    estate of Drusilla Cravens, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

            <p>The officers and members of the Indiana Historical Society, in the exercise of complete freedom in
                    the use of this section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History,</hi> desire to express
                    their gratitude to its retiring editor for his generous co-operation with the Society. In the
                    thirteen years which Professor William O. Lynch has edited the <hi rend="i">Magazine,</hi> it has
                    not only been the published product of work upon Indiana history in Indiana University, but the
                    vehicle for publication of worth-while articles written by others than professional historians and
                    graduate students. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> thus has greatly promoted interest in Indiana
                    history outside university and college walls. Doubtless a majority of the readers of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are men and women not directly connected with academic life. All the
                    members of the Indiana Historical Society receive the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in return for the
                    half of their annual membership fee which is sent to the University for this object. A very large
                    proportion of the members not only receive but read the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi>; they are
                    constantly expressing to the secretary their interest in some part of it or in all of it.</p>
            <p>The courtesy which the editor has shown to contributors and to those whose contributions for one
                    reason or another could not be used in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> has been noteworthy. No editor
                    escapes criticism; Professor Lynch's equitable disposition has enabled him to give fair
                    consideration to all criticisms without a trace of animosity toward the critic. The <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in both its pages and its management has reflected pleasantly the personality of
                    the editor. He has been a most effective liason officer between the University and the historically
                    minded public. His many friends in the Society hope that he will continue to contribute to the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and that they may enjoy association with him for many years to come:</p>
            <p>The membership of the Indiana Historical Society on June 16 stands at 1111; five honorary members,
                    eleven life members, eighty institutional members, thirty-two sustaining members, and nine hundred
                    eighty-three additional annual members. Usually a number of applications for membership are received
                    during the latter half of the calendar year. As the annual memberships run with the calendar year,
                    the arrangement <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-037-2-061"/> prevails for such applicants to take membership
                    for a year and half upon payment of a three-dollar membership fee. It is the expectation of the
                    Society that the total membership at the end of 1941 will be well over twelve hundred.</p>

            <p>John Lympus Barnett was born on October 23, 1830, near Edinburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. He went with his parents to a farm near Cicero, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Hamilton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1853. Before volunteering for the Union Army, he worked at many different
                    occupations. He was graduated from a commercial school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had been a school teacher. At times, he appeared in cases as a lawyer in justice of
                    the peace courts. He owned a daguerrotype outfit and took pictures. He owned a small hand press and
                    printed handbills for sale in Cicero. He also assisted his father who operated a warehouse in the
                    town. They purchased merchandise and sold it wholesale. The young volunteer was five feet, eight and
                    one-half inches in height and weighed about one hundred forty pounds. He had dark brown hair and
                    gray eyes.</p>
            <p>Barnett volunteered when Lincoln called for three-year troops and became a member of Company B,
                    Thirty-ninth Indiana Volunteers on August 29, 1861, though he was frail and not well suited for the
                    arduous marching and fighting which would be required of him in the Union Army. The Thirty-ninth
                    Indiana was one of the first Union regiments to enter <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. This regiment was a part of the Army of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> commanded by Don Carlos Buell. Buell possessed an exaggerated respect for the
                    enemy's armies. He was most noted for his procrastination and fear of bringing on a fight.
                    The Thirty-ninth was first a part of the Second Brigade, commanded by T. J. Wood. The Second Brigade
                    was part of the Second Division, commanded by Alexander McDowell McCook. In November, 1861, it
                    became a part of the Sixth Brigade, and was placed under the command of R. W. Johnson, of the Second
                    Division.</p>
            <p>Buell's Army of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, from October, 1861, until February, 1862. Grant's Army of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> took Forts Henry and Donelson and forced a general retirement of the enemy from <placeName>

                    </placeName> reached <placeName>

                    </placeName> unopposed on March 2, 1862.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Grant's army was assembled on the left on west bank of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> River near Pittsburg Landing. He was preparing to attack. The enemy had gathered in
                    large numbers at Corinth, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, an important Confederate railroad junction near the <placeName>

                    </placeName> line. Grant was waiting for Buell to reinforce him, as ordered. Buell moved with his
                    usual hesitancy. Before he reached Grant, the Confederates attacked the Union forces near Pittsburg
                    Landing, bringing on the historic and bloody battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Thirty-ninth Indiana was with the Second Division thirty-two miles from Pittsburg Landing when
                    Grant's army was attacked on April 6, 1862. The Division made a forced march of twenty
                    miles reaching Savannah on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> River at 11:00 P.M. that night. The men spent the night in the streets of Savannah in a
                    pouring rain. The next day (April 7, 1862) the division arrived at Pittsburg Landing by boat from
                    Savannah. The Second Division played a vital part in the defeat of the Confederate forces during the
                    second day's battle. Sherman, in his official report, said: "I concede that
                    General McCook's splendid division from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> drove back the enemy along the Corinth road which was the great central line of this
                    battle."</p>

                    </placeName>, the Thirty-ninth Indiana took part in the occupation of Corinth on May 30, 1862. The

                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> and occupied Bridgeport, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Union armies worked from June to August, 1862, repairing the railroad. Buell was

                    </placeName>, but that order he never carried out. He allowed the Confederates, under Bragg, time to

                    Buell's folly and made a dash for the <placeName>

                    </placeName> river. This compelled the surrender of much territory and brought on the celebrated
                    race towards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                    </placeName> before Bragg, although he started later. In retreating, he displayed great ability. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was swarming with volunteers from the farms and work benches of the <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-037-2-064"/> Middle West and Bragg, estimating their fighting ability correctly,
                    gave up the idea of taking <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and decided to return southward.</p>
            <p>Buell was about to be relieved for his glaring failures but he was given another chance. He went in
                    pursuit of Bragg. Part of his army caught up with the enemy at Perryville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and fought an indecisive engagement on October 8, 1862. Buell allowed a portion of his
                    army to stand by doing nothing to assist the engaged regiments. He sent the Second Division over a
                    road to Perryville which was twenty miles longer than the nearest road. It arrived too late to be of
                    assistance. A military court tried Buell and he was deprived of his command. The command of his army
                    went to William Starke Rosecrans. The Second Division, along with the remainder of the Army of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, arriving there in November, 1862.</p>
            <p>John L. Barnett remained with his regiment until December 26, 1862. One that dey, he was ordered to
                    go to a hospital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was broken in health and in a dying condition as a result of the long march from
                    Bridgeport to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His father, learning of his condition, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to secure his release from the army, and he was discharged for disability on February
                    14, 1862. He left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> a few days later for home, where he died on February 24, 1868, the day after his
                    arrival. Sometime before his break-down, Barnett was promoted to Sergeant. The date of the promotion
                    is not known, but his discharge paper dated February 14, 1863, indicates that he was a First
                    Sergeant in Company B, Thirty-ninth Indiana Infantry. His disease is recorded as "Organic
                    Disease of the Heart." Indorsements on the face of the certificate of discharge show that
                    he was paid in full at <placeName>

                        <p>Yours of some time ago came to hand all right. And although I have not much of
                                    interest to write, I pen you a few lines being happy to inform you that I am in
                                    first rate health and really hope that this may find you all in the enjoyment of
                                    that same priceless boon. You can have the money you spoke of until I return, if I
                                    ever do, so far as I know at present. Pay day will soon be here again and I intend
                                    sending some more home when I get it. This I think will be in about 3 weeks. Nothing
                                    of importance has occurred with us since my last. We have been out on Picket once
                                    only, Rosecran's brigade made a reconnaissance about 7 miles South over in
                                    Dixie some days since, but found nothing that far up. There is a body of Secesh
                                    though I suppose not far from the region they visited. Our troops are digging down
                                    the hills beyond the river so that the Artillery can pass up and down. I think when

                                            court-martialed Turchin August 6, 1862, and dismissed him from the army. The
                                            fact that Buell had ignored Turchin's successes in official
                                            reports, brought forth many protests from <placeName>

            <p>John L. Barnett did not keep a diary during his service until he went to the hospital at the
                    beginning of his fatal illness. He commenced his diary late in December, 1862, or early in January,
                    1863. It was written in pencil in a very small (4 × 2 1/2) black, leather covered, note
                    book. Under the impact of his final illness, his clear and readable handwriting lost much of its
                    vigor. The last entry was made on February 18, 1863, in <placeName>

            <p>The diary, which covers but a short period, has no entries after the first, which is not dated, until
                    February 16, 1863. The first entry could not have been written earlier than December 30, 1862, and
                    may not have been written until near the middle of February. The first sentence in the entry of
                    February, 1863, is: "I suppose that they have gone home." The implication is that
                    this entry was written very soon after the first one which ends with the sentence: "My
                    father left me this morning about 11 ock." The diary was not continued after February 18,
                    1863. It seems probable that the writer, whose hold on life was very precarious and who had various
                    things to do, could not well find the time nor had he the energy to make further entries.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>Work sheets from foreign cabinetmakers were used in our country in very early days, but this
                    home-made workbook, written in 1856 by William H. H. Johnson, a young Indiana cabinetmaker, for his
                    personal use, has few parallels. It was found some months ago by Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Millikan of <placeName>

                    </placeName> while they were looking over family papers stored for many years in Mr.
                    Millikan's family home near Monrovia, Indiana.</p>
            <p>William H. H. Johnson, born in 1837, was the son of Dr. Lawrence and Edith Rolls (or Ralls) Johnson.
                    The first members of the family to come to Indiana were Isaac and Mary Cool, who obtained a grant of
                    land in <placeName>

            <p>Dr. Lawrence Johnson was graduated shortly after 1826 and went almost at once to the newly organized
                    town of Belleville, Hendricks County, Indiana, where he practiced medicine. In 1834, he married
                    Edith Rolls, and to them seven sons and daughters were born. "Willie" (William H.
                    H. Johnson), born in 1837, began in 1856 to work first for McCurdy and later (1857) for Bland,
                    cabinetmakers.</p>
            <p>As the workbook<hi rend="sup">1</hi> was for his own use, he made no attempt to watch the uniformity
                    of spelling. He sat down measures and methods of procedure; he wrote down formulae for staining and
                    removing stains from furniture; he set forth schedules of wages for various classes of workmen, and

                    furniture notes are verses to one or more young ladies of his acquaintance and other rhymes,
                    denoting a deeply emotional nature, and revealing that he was not too happy in the work of his
                    hands.</p>
            <p>He left the cabinetshop to study medicine—possibly, he recognized his failing
                    health—in March, 1859. Two months later his father wrote in the family Bible:
                    "Willie died at 1 A.M. May 25, happy in the Lord." His notebook was preserved by
                    the doctor-father (Dr. Lawrence Johnson), and, after the latter's death in 1871, his widow
                    (Edith Rolls Johnson) took it with other family papers to her daughter's home near
                    Monrovia. There she lived during the rest of her life with her daughter, Mrs. Eleazer Bales
                    Millikan, and her husband. After Mrs. Millikan's death on May 25, 1938, the notebook was

                    Catholic Church in Indiana. In its broader aspects, it is a general treatment of the French

            <p>Dr. McAvoy has taken for his task the job of bridging the gap in the history of the Catholic Church
                    in Indiana from the days of the French missions to the later American Church. To assist him in
                    treating this neglected portion of church history, he has had access to newly found materials in the
                    form of letters and journals and in addition has made an extensive use of the published documents
                    bearing on the subject.</p>
            <p>The work deals largely with the French at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. To the author the story of the French under American rule elicits the deepest
                    sympathy. Theirs was the history of a culture that could not readily acclimate to American
                    institutions. Contact with the Americans caused a rapid decline in French economy. Their prosperity
                    was based primarily on the fur trade. But American competition, Indian wars, and the depletion of
                    the fur supply almost dried up their once lucrative occupation.</p>
            <p>Had the French been able to turn from fur trading to agriculture, they might have become a more
                    influential element in Indiana history. Such a change in occupation was impossible, partly because
                    many were deprived of their lands, and also because they lacked the necessary capital to engage in
                    profitable agriculture.</p>
            <p>Dr. McAvoy ably supports his primary thesis that in spite of economic reverses and long periods of
                    neglect by church authorities, the French in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
                    </placeName> valleys remained faithful to the Catholic Church. Because they held to the credo of the

                    they concerned with the spiritual welfare of their flock, but with their social advancement as well.
                    As a result, they struggled for educational and social facilities and made lasting impressions on
                    their contemporaries and their progeny.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Hoosier.</hi> By Heath Bowman. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1941. Pp. 360, illustrated, $3.00.</head>
            <p>In this volume, the author endeavors to draw a "composite portrait" of the Hoosier,
                    setting for himself a difficult task. There is no such composite, and the most that any writer can
                    do is to present the materials to the reader and let that overworked individual in turn have the
                    pleasure of trying to do the impossible. The story runs along (there is a thread to it) simply
                    enough, and the Hoosier communities are revealed as they change from one stage to another. All sorts
                    of conditions and incidents are presented with plenty of the early Hoosier speech thrown in. It is
                    not hard to discover that the author is no Bourbon, and, incidentally, he drops a bit of wisdom here
                    and there.</p>
            <p>The book is made up of three parts: "The Sowing"—"The
                    Ripening"—"The Harvest." However, these titles mean little
                    more than an invitation to readers to think of the flow of Indiana history as a moving poem. The
                    chapters, of which there are twenty-five, follow in a general way the historical development of the
                    state. While illustrating conditions that prevailed in succeeding periods and tracing some of the
                    events of Indiana's history, the author introduces a number of the larger actors who have
                    played parts in the Hoosier drama. Light is thrown on the qualities and achievements of these
                    actors, though one will not find much biographical material relative to the noted Hoosiers who find
                    a place in the book.</p>
            <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-037-2-084"/>
            <p>There is the danger that anyone, however gifted, who writes a volume like <hi rend="i">Hoosier,</hi>
                    will over-stress the crudities of the language and life of pioneers. Frontier communities were not
                    stereotyped and there were always many fine people with some education and more fine people without
                    education mixed in with the other elements of the population. Various elements made up frontier
                    society and were in turn profoundly influenced by pioneer conditions. In the general picture, all
                    types must appear, but there are those that have come all the way through unscathed. These have made
                    Indiana, and upon them depends the Hoosier future. These truths, Mr. Bowman has tried to set forth,
                    and he has achieved a large measure of success. All who read his story will enjoy it, and some who
                    study it more reflectively will discover deeper things.</p>

            <p>Like most of the states of the Union, Indiana boasts a quarterly journal of history. The title for
                    many years has been <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> Starting in March, 1905, the
                    quarterly will round out a period of thirty-seven years with the December issue of 1941. The founder
                    of the <hi rend="i">Magazine,</hi> George S. Cottman, brought out about twenty-seven issues, Dr.
                    Logan Esarey edited about fifty-five issues, in all, and Dr. Christopher B. Coleman, serving as
                    temporary editor at times, in the periods of both Mr. Cottman and Dr. Esarey, edited about twelve
                    issues. Taking up my editorial duties with the issue of September, 1928, and laying them down with
                    the appearance of the current issue (June, 1941), I have carried on continuously for thirteen years.
                    The new editor, Dr. John Donald Barnhart, assuming his duties on July 1, 1941, will bring out the
                    issue of September, 1941. Dr. Barnhart was recently appointed associate professor of history at
                    Indiana University. Born and reared at <placeName>

                    </placeName> State University. He will teach courses in American history, specializing in the
                    history of the Middle West and Indiana history.</p>
            <p>The task of editing a state historical journal on the side for thirteen long years has consumed a
                    vast amount of my time and energy. Commenting on the job a few years ago. I stated that my years had
                    resolved themselves into a rapid succession of four months each — March, June, September
                    and December, the months in which the issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> are scheduled to
                    appear. To bring out four issues a year, it has been necessary to start a new one each quarter the
                    moment the preceding issue is off the press. For example, it has been necessary each year, after the
                    mailing of the December issue, to hurry to the work of publishing the March number; then, in
                    succession, to the June, September and December issues in like manner. David Harum said that it was
                    good for a dog to have fleas because it kept him from "broodin' on bein'
                    a dog." By the same token, I presume that it was good for a professor to edit <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-037-2-086"/> the <hi rend="i">Magazine,</hi> since he had no time to worry about the
                    troubles that naturally fall to a professor's lot.</p>
            <p>When the hour arrived for me to take on the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> in August, 1928, I had no copy
                    on hand. One of my graduate students had just written a master's thesis on the
                    "Senatorial Career of Albert J. Beveridge." At the suggestion of Dr. A. L.
                    Kohlmeier, I divided this study into two parts and ran it in my first two issues. Through Dr.
                    Christopher B. Coleman, I received a biographical sketch of "Ephraim Samuel Frazer,
                    1824–1896." Soon afterwards, Elmore Barce of Fowler, Indiana, submitted a sketch
                    of Jesse Birch, and Mrs. Leola Hackett of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, an article on the local history of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie Canal. A former student, Roger C. Hackett, now professor of history in the
                    junior college of the Panama <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cz">Canal Zone</country>
                    </placeName>, furnished me with a copy of a short Civil War diary. In my barrel, I found some copies
                    of interesting letters, written from 1857–1860 to a member of Congress who was a Douglas
                    man by citizens of Indiana. Instead of making bricks without straw, I was fortunately in possession
                    of enough material in a very short time to enable me to plan two issues of the <hi rend="i">Magazine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the opening of the year, 1929, I have never lacked for copy. Usually I have had enough ahead
                    for two or three issues. It has been my policy to try to give to the contents of each issue the mark
                    of variety. I have tried to avoid filling each issue with long articles by graduate students and I
                    have published very few long studies, serially. Such studies are properly published as separate
                    monographs. In every issue, I have tried to present some document or documents not previously
                    printed or else difficult of access if in print. In the thirteen years of my service, I have
                    published many articles written by prominent authors residing outside of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Much material has been published which was poorly prepared when received and which could easily have
                    been returned to the writers. It has been my rule not to reject valuable matter even when it has
                    required much revision. I have tried to remember that the quarterly should be an aid to amateurs in
                    history possessing something of real worth to contribute. I have labored hours over many manuscripts
                    to improve their organization, composition and accuracy. I have, however, endeavored to retain the
                    style and expressions of and not lose the individuality of any <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-037-2-087"/>
                    author. It would be amiss not to mention how generally amateur writers of all ages have appreciated
                    the efforts that have been made to improve their offerings before sending them to the printer.</p>
            <p>It is possible that some of my editorial ventures during my thirteen years have been indefensible. I
                    feel that it was rather daring and unusual to carry autobiographical sketches through twelve issues.
                    At other times, I commented independently on various current political and economic problems. I knew
                    at the time, that editors of historical magazines are supposed to keep in the background, and no
                    doubt I followed an unusual policy. In defense, I may say that it worried me to see that dignified
                    and trained historians were so often passed up by the reading public for authors of less ability
                    whose writings made a stronger appeal. As I reflected on this fact, I was tempted to experiment some
                    with the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History,</hi> the purpose being to make it more attractive
                    if possible without lowering the standard. Perhaps, I erred, but, if so, it is too late to retrace
                    my course.</p>
            <p>I wish to add in conclusion that while I am glad to be relieved of the burden of carrying the <hi rend="i">Magazine,</hi> I regret to break off the many fine relationships that have attended the
                    editorship. I have deeply appreciated the friendliness and support extended to me by hundreds of
                    persons during my period as editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History.</hi> May this
                    quarterly live long and grow in value and interest.</p>

            <p>The book in which the marriage records for 1816 to 1826 printed below were entered was lost so long
                    ago that no one in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange</region>
                    </placeName> County Court House at Paoli, Indiana, knew of its existence until it was brought to
                    light last March in the furnace room of the building. A pile of papers brought down from the attic
                    about three years ago included the records. John Marshall, the custodian, discovered that it was
                    interesting reading, and, when he mentioned it to Attorney Arthur Dillard, the latter investigated
                    and restored the book to its place in the county archives. Previous to this discovery, the earliest
                    records in the clerk's office began in 1826.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Myrtle Maris Mavity (French Lick, Indiana) made a pencil copy of the marriage records in the
                    rescued book and, with the help of her husband, N. B. Mavity, made three type-written copies,
                    placing the original in the clerk's office, as the old record book is both difficult to use
                    and too valuable to be handled. A carbon copy was sent to the Genealogy Room of the State Library.
                    Some court proceedings are also recorded in the book but these were not copied. The spelling of
                    names found in the book was copied without change. Mrs. Mavity discovered the fact that after March
                    22, 1817, there is no record of licenses issued. It is possible that returns were not always made;
                    also that ministers making returns sometimes dated them when made, instead of using the actual date
                    of the marriage.</p>
