                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> territorial system properly begins several decades before the American Revolution. Many
                    of the ideas ultimately incorporated into the American territorial system first found expression, in
                    one form or another, some time during the half century or so before 1775. In this period
                    developments took place illustrative as antecedents of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which
                    created the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> territorial system, and of the companion Land Ordinance of 1785, which established the
                    characteristic American rectangular land survey system. These antecedents were encompassed in the
                    plans for settlement west of the Appalachians in colonial times and in the schemes for new British
                    colonies in the interior of North America. While none of the new colony schemes was ever realized,
                    their sponsors put forth some of the initial suggestions of elements in the later plan of the
                    territorial system. Their ideas and plans were known and carefully evaluated by the Continental
                    Congress during and after the Revolution.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Since they represented the first
                    proposed departure from the old pattern of expansion westward by the original colonies<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and the first indigenously American deliberations upon new colonization, the new colony
                    ventures merit consideration as a phase of the ideological growth and shaping of the territorial
                    system and of America constitutionalism. Upon examination, the proposals and schemes for new western
                    settlement in the late colonial period exhibit many tendencies and philosophies later expressed
                    again in the Ordinances of 1785 and 1787.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> For the purposes of this essay, two kinds of westward expansion in
                        colonial America may be noted: peripheral expansion into unoccupied areas by the existing
                        colonies without central direction from the imperial authorities; and unitary expansion, under
                        such central direction, through the creation of new colonies. Peripheral expansion was the only
                        kind actually undertaken in the period considered here, but the proposals for new western
                        colonies anticipated a system of unitary expansion such as was later provided in the territorial
                        scheme of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. One of the factors favoring unitary expansion was the
                        distance of the newly annexed parts of the existing colonies from their centers of government
                        and commerce. Another was their isolation either across natural barriers, such as the
                        Appalachians, or the intervening territory of another colony, as in the case of the <placeName>

            <p>The proposals for new western colonies originated with the accelerated growth of English America in
                    the decades immediately preceding the French and Indian War (1754–1760). During this time
                    almost all of the lands east of the Appalachian divide were either settled or owned by speculators.
                    The Indian traders’ frontier also advanced so far that by the middle of the 1740s it had
                    penetrated into the older sphere of French interest in the Ohio Valley. The result was increased
                    concern on the part of both the British and the French for their claims to the trans-Allegheny
                    region, which not only precipitated the showdown of 1754–1763, but stirred the English
                    colonists to plan for the future of their claimed western realm.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first steps toward an actual Anglo-American occupation of the transmontane district were taken by
                    Virginians. As early as 1716 Governor Alexander Spotswood led an expedition across the Alleghenies,
                    and two years later he suggested to the British ministry the establishment of permanent settlements
                    in the Great Lakes area.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> While no immediate action followed upon
                    Spotswood's proposals, the colonies’ interest in the western country was already
                    receiving recognition.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>The company in its subsequent program for colonization anticipated several considerations of the

                    status with traditional governmental organization for the new western commonwealth. The scheme also

                    extending the ideas and plans of the earlier proposals. As the hostilities closed in favor of
                    Britain and Anglo-America, the development and constitutional arrangements of the western country

                    the coveted interior region, at once discerned the necessity of formulating some regular western
                    policy. Accordingly, the royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763, setting for the time being a
                    westward limit to settlement, was issued as an interim measure, in order to gain time to make

                            were not contiguous to the older colonies, probably was a factor in the shift of interest
                            among the new colony advocates to the upper Ohio region. Johnson's negotiations
                            with the Six Nations were rather characteristic of Anglo-American bartering with the Indians

                            met on June 14, 1769, and soon thereafter organized a committee which on December 27, 1769,
                            became the Grand Ohio Company. This company was also called the Walpole Company and, later
                            on, the Vandalia Company. The name Grand Ohio Company was used to distinguish the new
                            organization from the old Ohio Company of <placeName>

                            with George Mercer, the older company's agent. Mercer's action, however,
                            dissatisfied other members of the old Virginia group, who were unhappy with the extremely

                    Council was directed to draw up a report on the grant and a draft of the charter for the new colony.
                    Lord Dartmouth presented the Privy Council's recommendations on May 6, 1773. Vandalia was
                    to comprehend all of the lands received from the Indians at Fort Stanwix, comprising the area
                    bounded by the Ohio and Louisa (now <placeName>

                    the establishment of the new colony was the preparation of its charter and grant. The solicitor
                    general and the attorney general, however, raised objections which delayed their carrying out the

                        government.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proposed government of Vandalia included a royally appointed governor and a legislature of two
                    houses, much as in the other royal colonies. The governor had "the like
                    Powers—Privileges and Authorities both Civil and Military as are given to the Governors
                    of other Colonies under [the British imperial] Government." The upper house of the
                    legislature consisted of "a Council consisting of twelve Persons to be appointed by [the
                    crown] in like manner as the Councils in other Royal Governments." The council should
                    "have the same Powers Privileges and Authorities and be subject to the same Restrictions
                    and Regulations as in other Colonies." The lower house, called the "House of
                    Representatives," comprised "two Deputies elected by the Majority of Freeholders
                    of each of the Counties" of the colony; but, until the province had been sufficiently
                    settled to warrant the organization of twelve counties, the lower house would have twenty-four
                    members "chosen by the Freeholders of the Province at large." To qualify for
                    election as a representative, a man was required to own one thousand acres of land in fee simple,
                    and adhere to a Protestant faith; a voting freeholder must similarly own two hundred acres and be a
                    Protestant. The legislature jointly held the "Power and Authority to make, constitute and
                    ordain Laws Statutes and Ordinances for the Publick Peace Welfare and good Government of the said
                    Colony." Parliamentary procedure should be as "is observed in Respect to the
                    passing Acts of Parliament in Great Britain." The governor was given the right of veto and
                    of convening and proroguing the legislature; and the Privy Council reserved the right to disallow
                    laws of the colony. The new colony was also to have a superior court and lesser courts of common
                    law; the judges of these courts shared with the governor the powers of appointing local <list type="footnotes">

            <p>In drawing up the Vandalia charter the Privy Council was erecting a new dominion equal in status and
                    similar in most governmental respects to the older colonies. The Council specified as its
                    controlling purpose in so doing "the Necessity ... for introducing some regular and uniform
                    System of Government" into the western country. In this and in most of its other aspects
                    the Vandalia program, like the earlier new colony schemes, anticipated the guiding principles
                    followed by the Continental Congress when it undertook to prepare instruments of government for the
                        hinterland.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> When granting the requests of the Vandalia proprietors-to-be,
                    the Council was, moreover, merely following the sort of advice which Americans like Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> had long been offering. This advice, expressed through the Privy Council in the
                    Vandalia charter, would presently find re-expression in the Continental Congress’
                    ultimate decision on statehood for the western country.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, as the efforts of the Grand Ohio Company were reaching their climax, another new scheme
                    appeared which represented, by and large, the final stage in the development of the new colony idea.
                    This concern, called the Transylvania Company, differed considerably in its <hi rend="i">modus
                        operandi</hi> from most of the other colonization schemes. Rather than dealing with the imperial
                    ministry through regular channels to obtain a land grant and a charter as the other companies had
                    lately been doing, the Transylvania Company acted on its own initiative, apparently without other
                    authority, to establish and organize under a new jurisdiction a settlement beyond the mountains. The
                    company was organized originally as the Louisa Company, a speculative enterprise, by Judge Richard <placeName>

            <p>The "compact" was surprisingly democratic in tone. It provided for annual elections

                    people"; the lower court judges were to "be recommended by the people, and
                    approved of by the proprietors." Finally, the "compact" decreed

                    members presumably remembered and utilized many of the ideas that had been promulgated. Like the
                    Ordinances of 1785 and 1787, the proposals for new interior colonies—far more than
                    representing merely the grasping of speculators—were proffered solutions to the western
                    problem. The theme of problem and solution was demonstrated <list type="footnotes">

                    Fundamentally, these arguments answered to three specific problems: the older colonies’
                    need for security against invasions and depredations; the problem of getting and maintaining
                    possession of the western claim; and the desire for a sphere for the continued growth of colonial
                    trade, settlement, and land speculation. The prospects for continued growth in the existing area of
                    the colonies no longer seemed satifactory. The proposed new colonies, as their backers pointed out,
                    offered solutions to all of these problems. The same problems, in only slightly different
                    circumstances, were dealt with presently by the infant Republic when it drew up the ordinances
                    creating the territorial system. Considerations of the Indian trade, of the Spanish and British
                    threats, and of the welfare of the original states and the western settlers alike always stood
                    before Congress and were part of the stimuli to establishment of the territorial system.</p>
            <p>Even more important, however, were the actual constitutional precedents offered by the schemes for
                    new colonies. Notable among these precedents was the introduction of the New <placeName>

                    </placeName> land system of townships, rectangular coordinates, and advance location, to replace the
                    old, haphazard method of metes and bounds and indiscriminate location earlier used on the Virginia
                    and Pennsylvania frontiers. The New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> system was specified in the proposals of Thomas Pownall, Samuel Hazard, the
                    Susquehannah Company, and William <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Illinois Company.<hi rend="sup">78</hi> Moreover, the plans of Hazard, the
                    Susquehannah Company, the Illinois Company, and the draft charter of Vandalia all reserved for
                    public use (as for the support of schools and churches) certain portions of the territories of their
                    respective colonies.<hi rend="sup">79</hi> These ideas in refined form composed much of the

            </p>
            <p>The schemes for new western colonies also anticipated in many important respects the design of the
                    Ordinance of 1787. Most important, the new colony exponents expected their colonies to stand as
                    equals with the older colonies—to enjoy the same prerogatives and autonomy. They cited

                    Spanish and Indian depredations and intrusions on the southern frontier, and had been accorded a
                    status equal to that of the other colonies.<hi rend="sup">81</hi> This anticipated that clause of
                    the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which declared that the new states "shall be admitted ...
                    on an equal footing with the original States."<hi rend="sup">82</hi> Moreover, by planning
                    new and separate governments for the western country, the new colony advocates announced their
                    conviction, born of experience, that the older colonies could not govern properly beyond certain
                    westward limits.<hi rend="sup">83</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new western colony schemes in addition presaged the Ordinance of 1787 in attempting to assure
                    that their prospective settlers would retain the privileges and rights they had enjoyed as
                    inhabitants of the older colonies. Except for the evangelical scheme of Hazard, the new colony
                    proposals, most notably Transylvania, were inclined to allow broad liberties of conscience although
                    they did usually restrict voting and officeholding to Protestants. In terms of property
                    qualifications, however, the Vandalia charter granted a suffrage no less liberal than that in most
                    of the older colonies.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> In Transylvania, which also promised "a
                    perfect religious freedom and general toleration," the suffrage belonged not merely to
                    freeholders, but to "the people."<hi rend="sup">85</hi> All of the colonization
                    ventures sought charters instituting the same forms of government that prospective settlers had been
                    used to in their home areas. Some proposals, like the Vandalia charter, actually spelled out the

            <p>There is some evidence that the proponents of the new colonies anticipated, in rough outline, the

                    provide for their rule until their independent status as colonies had been established.<hi rend="sup">88</hi> In every case, temporary arrangements while the colonies were being settled
                    and organized were implicit, if not explicit, in their proponents’ plans.</p>
            <p>Also implied in the proposals for new western colonies was the supposition that the western country
                    would eventually be subdivided entirely into new commonwealths. Several of the new colony schemes
                    proposed the establishment of more than one new colony at a time. If any one of the projected new
                    colonies had been erected, it seems likely that others would have followed upon the precedent set by
                    the first one.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> The suggestion of separate interior colonies constituted,
                    therefore, an important departure from the old process of irregular peripheral expansion by the
                    individual colonies, in favor of an organized advance approach to western settlement. This was an
                    important step in the direction of the future territorial system.<hi rend="sup">90</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proposals for new western colonies reflected, moreover, a growing tendency in American political
                    thinking. Basically, this was the abandonment of provincialism in American politics in favor of the
                    view that all the colonies formed integral parts of a single national community and their
                    inhabitants one people. With regard to the western country, this meant that the land should belong
                    not in parcels to the individual colonies (or some of them), but to the whole union.<hi rend="sup">91</hi> This trend of thought would give birth after the Revolution to the federalized

                    </placeName>, and to the territorial system as well. The destiny of the western country had become
                    an issue inseparable from the other questions arising in the years just before the eruption of the
                    Revolution: the future of American governmental institutions, and the relations of the individual
                    colonies to each other and to the central authority of the empire as a whole.<hi rend="sup">92</hi>

            <p>By the close of the 1870s British agriculture, which had recently enjoyed a period of almost
                    unparalleled prosperity, was rapidly approaching a state of crisis. Many of the causes were local,
                    but a major factor was the increased competition from <placeName>

                    of Commons to survey the entire problem in an effort to discover possible legislative solutions, and
                    two members of Parliament, Mr. Claire Read and Mr. Albert Pell, were sent to America to investigate
                    the competition at first hand.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The commissioners were, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, "two great ornaments

                    member of a prominent Norfolk farming family, was successfully managing large properties before
                    reaching his majority. Elected to the House of Commons in 1865 as a Tory, he held his seat until
                    1880 when he was defeated by a single vote. Read sat in the House again in 1884–1885 but
                    was an unsuccessful candidate in 1886. His major concern in the House was agricultural affairs, and
                    during his tenure he served on almost every important agricultural committee. Read wrote several
                    prize essays on agriculture, and he worked actively in various agricultural societies. Appointed
                    parliamentary secretary to the Local Government Board in February, 1874, he resigned two years later
                    when the government refused to extend to <placeName>

                    his indignant demands for action to combat the cattle plague brought him to the public's
                    attention. Elected to the House of Commons three years later, he served in that body until his
                    retirement in 1885. Though politically a Tory, Pell was considered radical in several areas in which
                    he sought reforms. His particular interests included the poor law, county government, local
                    taxation, social reform, and agricultural improvements. Pell was active in writing and teaching

            <p>The British commissioners saw Indiana's agriculture in an especially good year. An
                    agricultural revolution had been wrought within the generation by better transportation outlets,
                    improved farming techniques, and increased use of machinery.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The acres devoted
                    to corn had increased from 2,627,980 in 1872 to 3,517,808 in 1879, although the yield per acre had
                    remained almost constant at 32–33 bushels per acre. But the production of wheat had
                    soared from 1,902,599 acres in 1872 to 2,422,480 acres in 1879, and the 1879 yield of 20.3 bushels
                    far exceeded the decade's average of 12.9. The number of cattle had declined from 1,211,246
                    in 1872 to 1,065,143 in 1879, but by the latter year Indiana breeders were convinced that they were
                    at last producing cattle equal to those found anywhere in the country.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Although

            <p>Students of recent history are frequently handicapped by a lack of some of the source materials
                    available to their colleagues who research in earlier periods of history. Conversing by telephone
                    has substantially replaced the writing of confidential letters; the ubiquitous copying machine has
                    made some people wary of revealing their thoughts on paper lest unauthorized copies stray into
                    unknown hands; and the pace of modern life is such that it seems fewer people trouble to keep a
                    diary. The result is the loss of much personal information necessary for a better understanding of
                    historical events. Projects in oral history attempt to compensate to some degree for this loss by
                    using other means, usually tape-recorded interviews, to preserve individuals’ thoughts
                    and reminiscences. In responding to the questions put to him, the person interviewed is encouraged
                    to converse at length about events he has witnessed, events or movements in which he has
                    participated, and people he has known. It is the interviewer's task to guide the discussion
                    along profitable paths by asking intelligent questions, a responsibility which often requires a
                    great deal of advance preparation. After taping, the conversation is usually transcribed, edited,
                    and made available to scholars. However, the person interviewed may place any restriction he wishes
                    on the dissemination and use of the information he has given.</p>
            <p>The employment of oral history techniques has steadily increased since Allan Nevins organized the
                    first oral history project at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in 1948. A national Oral History Association having over 700 individual and
                    institutional members holds an annual colloquium, and a directory published by the association lists
                    230 oral history projects in operation in 1971 with more being planned.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Yet the
                    impressive growth of oral history during the last twenty years has not completely overcome
                    skepticism as to its value. Some historians, preferring to depend upon written sources, claim that
                    the information gained in an oral history interview may be tainted either by efforts of the
                    interviewee to cover up his mistakes and glorify his successes or by lapses of memory due to the
                    passing of years. Yet it must be conceded that diarists have not always committed the whole truth to
                    paper and that archives do hold letters <list type="footnotes">

                    to test the value of oral history is to study and use it.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1971 the Indiana State Library asked every library and known archival repository in
                    the state, including many business and private organizations engaged in preserving their own
                    histories, for information about the tape recordings in their possession. The responses to that
                    inquiry, from which the following listing was compiled, show that oral history is being practiced by
                    a variety of organizations scattered throughout Indiana. As a whole, the interviews that have been
                    collected are strongest in the fields of education and politics. Of the three largest collections in
                    the state—those at Indiana University, Purdue University, and the Indiana State
                    Library—the first two stress the histories of their institutions, while the state library
                    has spent considerable time interviewing political figures. The rapidly growing collection at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> University concentrates on persons in southwestern Indiana and southeastern Illinois
                    with emphasis on events during the Great Depression. The smaller libraries and historical societies,
                    as might be expected, are especially concerned with the histories of their own localities. Since
                    oral history lends itself to nearly every aspect of human endeavor, more work could well be done in
                    such areas as religion, labor, black history, the arts, and business. It should be noted that the
                    bulk of taped materials collected in Indiana seems to consist of passive recordings of speeches,
                    sermons, minutes of meetings, and the like, rather than planned oral history interviews. Such
                    materials are not included in the present listing but may be separately inventoried at a later date.</p>
            <p>The information given below for each taped interview is organized as follows: the name of the
                    interviewee, his background, a synopsis of the contents of the interview, the date of the taping,
                    the length of the transcript, and the name of the interviewer. In a few instances not all of this
                    information was available for a given tape. The absence of a transcript at the time of the survey is
                    indicated by the notation "In preparation" or "Not transcribed."
                    Since the use of many tapes and transcripts is restricted, researchers are strongly advised to
                    determine the status of the material they wish to examine before visiting a repository.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Delaware Indians: A History.</hi> By C. A. Weslager. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nkc">New Brunswick</region>
                    </placeName>: Rutgers University Press, 1972. Pp. xix, 546. Maps, illustrations, notes, appendices,
                    index. $17.50.)</head>
            <p>Nineteenth century critics of federal Indian policy often used the example of the Delaware Indians to
                    demonstrate the destructive effect of repeatedly removing tribes from one location to another.
                    Modern scholars often mention the dramatic decline of Delaware population before 1867 while the
                    Indians were being moved gradually from the Delaware Valley to Indian Territory, where they were
                    merged with the Cherokee and ceased to exist as an independent political entity. Yet despite this
                    interest and the obvious importance of the tribe in the colonial and early national periods,
                    Weslager's new book is the first modern history of the Delaware people.</p>
            <p>Although Weslager has attempted to develop an ethnohistorical account of the Delaware and does
                    describe their culture at the time of white contact, this is primarily a tribal history presented in
                    the general chronological framework of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history. It is not a well balanced survey. Occasionally he presents more background
                    material from <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history than necessary, and, although he carries his story to the present, the emphasis
                    is on the early and best known period of the tribe's history, which also falls within the
                    area of Weslager's previous research. About two thirds of the text is devoted to the period
                    before 1783. This is unfortunate because, although the author indicates that an entire book could be
                    written about the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>'s sojourn in Indiana, only a chapter is devoted to this subject. Little
                    attention is given to the history of the Delaware in the twentieth century. Moreover, one might
                    debate the inclusion of an entire chapter on the Walam Olum, the wood or bark tablets that some
                    believe is a record of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>'s past and others discount as a fake. Weslager believes they are authentic.</p>
            <p>Weslager writes with a loose, folksy style, and includes details that will be of interest to local
                    historians. He is careful to include precise geographical locations and to identify various <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName>, a difficult task considering the variety of English spellings of Delaware words and
                    the fact that the English, Dutch, and Swedes had different ears for recording Indian names. In these
                    and other areas he has been assisted by Delaware informants. Attention to local details, however,
                    apparently prevented the author from giving fuller accounts of more important events.</p>
            <p>Portions of the history of the Delaware have been presented before and often in greater depth,
                    especially in Anthony F. C. Wallace's <hi rend="i">Teedyuskung, King of the Delawares</hi>
                    and <placeName>

                    of the citations are from previously published primary and secondary works. It is most unfortunate
                    that he has chosen not to include a bibliography. As ethnohistory, it falls short of the high
                    standards set by Wallace or John Ewers; as tribal history, it does not match the quality of recent
                    tribal studies by historians such as Donald Berthrong, Arrell Gibson, or William Unrau. However, it
                    is the only modern history of the Delaware and will serve as a guide until a more balanced history
                    is written.</p>

            <p>The Iroquois were indeed an unfortunate people, who were forced to enter the Revolutionary War in
                    which they did not have the remotest interest. What made the Revolution so crucial for the Iroquois
                    was ironically not the losing side they chose but the great sufferings they had to go through. Even
                    pro-American Iroquois who sought American protection in Schenectady in 1780 experienced unusual
                    misery, suffering famine, cold, and disease. Physical devastation, a civil war, and the
                    disintegration of the confederation accelerated the eventual decline of Iroquoian power. Such is the
                    story Professor Graymont tells in great detail. In writing mainly a narrative history, she makes two
                    important contributions. First, the book explores the Iroquois’ political and military
                    activities during the Revolution as has never been done before. The author tells the story well
                    through such colorful figures as Sir William Johnson, Samuel Kirkland, Sir John Johnson, Philip
                    Schuyler, Cornplanter, Blacksnake, and, above all, her hero, Joseph Brant. Second and more
                    important, she fully examines the cultural dimension of the Iroquois, showing how native myth,
                    symbol, and tradition played a significant role in their dealings with the whites.</p>
            <p>When the Revolutionary War broke out, the Six Nations of the Iroquois confederacy were determined to
                    remain neutral and resisted pressures from both sides. Graymont points out that the
                    Iroquois’ ultimate reasons for supporting the English were not only their traditional
                    friendship with the British but generous supplies of British goods. Totally lacking in such
                    supplies, the Americans failed even to keep the natives neutral. Once the natives fought in the
                    battles of Fort Stanwix and Oriskany in the summer of 1777, their <pb n="340" id="VAA4025-068-4-058"/> commitment to the war fully regenerated itself because of the Indian revenge psychology. The
                    General John Sullivan expedition against the Six Nations in 1779, which succeeded in devastating a
                    number of the Iroquoian villages, did not achieve its objective of humbling the Indians and of
                    forcing them to sue for peace. Instead, it made the Indians determined to have their revenge upon
                    the Americans.</p>
            <p>Graymont explains the Iroquoian view about the treatment of prisoners, which horrified both Americans
                    and the British. The Indians regarded torture of captives as a religious rite. By the
                    prisoners’ pain and sufferings, the Indians believed they could remove the pain and
                    torment from the spirits of their war dead. But those captives who were adopted by the Indians were
                    treated with fairness and even deep affection. With equal feeling and understanding, the author
                    analyzes the fate of the Iroquois, who were doomed no matter which side they chose, as their lands
                    were gradually encroached upon by the whites. Graymont maintains that a British victory might have
                    postponed but would not have prevented their decline. For the pro-British Iroquois who migrated to
                    the Grand River region in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="onc">Ontario</region>
                    </placeName>, the process was the same, only slower.</p>
            <p>Graymont has produced a well balanced and useful work, one which merits frequent citation. The
                    author's indiscriminate presentation of material, however, makes the reading somewhat
                    monotonous. Her enthusiasm for details leads her to neglect the larger context of problems. The
                    footnotes and bibliography, which do not apparently include some recent general works, also reflect
                    this weakness. Should not, for example, the loyalists’ remarkable success in winning
                    Iroquois support be conceived more broadly? What is the significance of the war with the
                    Six Nations, which is treated almost as a separate war in this book, in relation to the entire
                    war? The consideration of such questions could have added more value to this solid work.</p>

                    paper to politics in a broad sense, and in their hands it became a product of a very personal sort
                    of journalism. Expressions of their editorial opinions were frequent and normally forthright.</p>
            <p>Generally staunchly devoted to Jeffersonian Republicanism in its early years, the paper sided with
                    the National Republicans against the Jacksonians when new parties surfaced in the 1820s.
                    Nevertheless, it maintained an independence and consistency of editorial viewpoint which
                    occasionally found it disagreeing with friends or supporting opponents. At times it merely chose the
                    lesser of two evils, as in the 1840 presidential campaign when it advocated the election of Harrison
                    more out of dislike for Van Buren than from any fondness for "Old Tipp." Under
                    such circumstances the <hi rend="i">Intelligencer</hi> developed a character truly its own and many
                    read it as much for its opinions as for the information it published.</p>
            <p>A major contribution of the <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi> was the extensive publication in
                    its columns of public documents concerning the operation of the federal government. The high
                    editorial standards employed in presenting the texts of documents was one of the paper's
                    hallmarks, and those standards were generally matched in attendant commentary which put the
                    documents in perspective. Newspapers throughout the country quoted the commentaries almost as
                    faithfully as they did the documents themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">National Intelligencer</hi> was in financial straits for most of its existence,
                    despite the large sums it took in as printer to the federal government. During a twenty-six year
                    period when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers almost monopolized federal printing contracts, the <hi rend="i">Intelligencer</hi> received at least $1,000,000 in revenue therefrom. This was in
                    addition to $650,000 Gales and Seaton received for the printing of the <hi rend="i">Annuals of Congress</hi> and the <hi rend="i">American State Papers</hi> before 1845, at which
                    time major portions of both series remained incomplete (p. 282). Notwithstanding this welcome
                    federal largess, the editors maintained their high degree of political independence.</p>
            <p>Ames has written an informative book about a newspaper whose story amply deserved the telling. His
                    account is well organized and interestingly presented, and the history of the <hi rend="i">Intelligencer</hi> is effectively interwoven with that of the country. The volume is based upon
                    substantial research, and many readers will be happy to find that the numerous citations are on the
                    same pages as the text to which they refer.</p>

            <p>In the American political tradition persons holding elective office often have to contend with
                    recurring pressures. How best to serve constituents, the difficulty of providing for their families,
                    and ascending within their respective parties cause politicians anxiety during their careers. While
                    there is this common ground among elected officeholders, how they respond to these responsibilities
                    determines, in large measure, their individuality. These common political pressures and different
                    individual responses provide an excellent vista from which to study man and society.</p>
            <p>The pressures thrust upon Congressman James K. Polk and his responses can be viewed in the more than
                    800 letters in this volume. Editors Weaver and Bergeron indicate that of the 512 letters published
                    in full, over 100 represent family matters, over 100 are of a national political nature, while 20
                    are from Ephraim Beanland, the overseer of Polk's plantation in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. Also included is the welter of correspondence relating to the needs and appeals of
                    Polk's constituents. Despite the editors’ gathering of Polk materials from more
                    than fifty depositories, the majority of the correspondence is from the Polk Papers, Manuscript
                    Division, Library of Congress.</p>
            <p>The controversy over the rechartering of the Second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> always has intrigued historians. The jacket of this work indicates that Polk served as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s floor leader in the House when the President decided to withhold federal
                    funds from the bank. Despite Polk's role in the effort, Amos Kendall was the thinker and
                    coordinator of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s attack on the bank. The correspondence of Polk reinforces what Lynn L.
                    Marshall stated in his article, "The Authorship of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>

                        Review</hi>, L (December, 1963), 466–77, that Kendall was the Jacksonian director in
                    the Bank War. The Tennessean took his cues from Kendall. In the volume there are just three letters
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Polk and in the first one <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> closes his letter, "I write in haste. Present me to Mrs. Poke and all the
                    family ..." (p. 106). Fortunately the Polk name fares better in the two subsequent letters.</p>
            <p>The editors and the publisher, Vanderbilt University Press, are to be congratulated for maintaining
                    the high standards set in the publication of Volume One. To be sure, the political star of Young
                    Hickory will shine brighter in later volumes.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Kansas City</settlement>
                    </placeName> are probably aware that these trains are part of a transcontinental network of
                    railroads stretching from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. The present transcontinental
                    connections, however, are not those envisioned by the promoters of the predecessor lines that
                    provided the nucleus for today's Frisco. The original route was intended to make <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> a terminal where a "snow free" line along the thirty-fifth parallel
                    from the Pacific would connect with carriers operating to the East. Though these plans are still
                    reflected in the corporate title, the Frisco as constructed became a regional carrier that is part
                    of a transcontinental system more by geographical accident than through the traffic patterns
                    designed by its promoters.</p>
            <p>The thirty-fifth parallel project was embodied in no less than five corporations in the period from
                    1853–1890. In the process of its evolution it enriched the purses of a few people at the
                    expense of many. Farmers, shopkeepers, widows, and various governmental units were all in one way or
                    another engaged in the financing—involvements that often led to the loss of savings and
                    tax funds. The only people who appeared to profit from the line were the attorneys who defended the
                    companies in court and lobbied for them in the state legislatures. At times the same lawyers were
                    involved in the bankruptcy proceedings of one predecessor road while simultaneously assisting in the
                    organization of a corporation to take over the defunct company's operations.</p>
            <p>The type and quality of railroad management varied considerably during the mania of expansion in the
                    latter half of the nineteenth century. Some operators treated their rail lines as serious business
                    operations that could be used to expand and develop the vast areas of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to the mutual advantage of its citizens and its government. Others treated their
                    railroads solely as means of gaining an economic stranglehold on some unfortunate group. The
                    thirty-fifth parallel project experienced both types of management as it captured the attention of
                    such leading speculators of the period as Clovis P. Huntington and Jay Gould.</p>
            <p>This book does a commendable job of analyzing corporate resources in detailing the financial and
                    operational problems of the various companies. The use of current periodicals of the era has
                    enriched the narrative with much local flavor. A unique aspect of <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-068-4-062"/> Professor Miner's treatment is his discussion of the opposition of the Indians of the
                    Indian Territory, who had been promised that the land would be theirs until the waters ceased to
                    flow and the moon rose no more, to the granting of land for the railroad. Too few authors have given
                    recognition to the efforts minority groups have made in their own behalf throughout American
                    history.</p>
            <p>Miner's book provides a valuable insight into the early history of a rail line that
                    historians had previously ignored or discussed with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. Students of
                    railroad and financial history will find both value and enjoyment in it.</p>

            <p>Few authors have been more successful in developing the institutional history of a particular aspect
                    of American higher education than Professors Johnson and Johanningmeier, whose work is a refinement
                    and extension of their recent doctoral dissertations. <hi rend="i">Teachers for the <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> is a penetrating study of the development of teacher education at the
                    University of Illinois to 1945. The description of the university's involvement with
                    teaching in the public schools of Illinois and the campus rivalry between the old, established
                    disciplines and the upstart known as pedagogy is both dramatic and insightful. Perhaps the
                    authors’ most unique contribution is their illuminating and largely successful attempt to
                    place their subject within the context of the larger problem of education in American culture. Their
                    efforts to relate the relevance of the subject to social trends and general cultural and
                    intellectual movements of the. time are commendable. The right questions are raised; and plausible,
                    if not completely authoritative, answers are provided.</p>
            <p>The authors’ essential conclusion is that throughout Illinois the university's
                    relations with the public schools and its imperial attitude toward other institutions of higher
                    education, particularly the normal schools, created a host of difficulties. In their words:
                    "The University, as the apex’ of the state's school system, did (and
                    cared to do) little to improve the ‘base.’ The schools were on the whole more
                    used than aided, let alone led" (p. 445). The university, they conclude, must accept some
                    blame for the fact that Illinois has lagged behind other states in both the quantity and quality of
                    public education at all levels in spite of its quantitatively superior status in wealth and numbers.</p>
            <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-068-4-063"/>
            <p>Johnson and Johanningmeier make good use of the wealth of manuscript material dealing with their
                    subject in the University of Illinois archives. Beginning with their first chapter which concerns
                    nineteenth century Illinois schools as revealed in Charles Shamel's
                    "Diary" and concluding with a dramatic final chapter climaxed by the involuntary
                    retirement of Dean Thomas E. Brenner, the authors employ the personal papers of university
                    presidents, deans, and alumni to develop their essentially biographical approach to the subject.
                    While handled in a thoroughly competent fashion, this biographical treatment tends to preclude the
                    inclusion of other important aspects of the subject to which the authors only allude in passing.
                    Little attention is given to demographic factors, to political, legislative, and financial
                    developments, or to the role of private and parochial education in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>—subjects which should be included in any definitive treatment of the
                    material. In short, the book is too much an internal study of the dean's office and not
                    enough a study of certain external factors bearing on the subject. In all fairness, however, it
                    should be noted that Johnson and Johanningmeier recognize these limitations. After carefully
                    delineating in the Preface what they intend to do, they then proceed to do it in a narrative that is
                    both well written and scholarly in nature.</p>
            <p>On occasion the book seems a bit wordy and even circuitous in its approach. Important and perceptive
                    points are occasionally buried in a plethora of biographical and institutional facts. But on balance
                    the book is a solid piece of historical research which should serve as a model for other
                    institutional histories in the field of American higher education. <hi rend="i">Teachers of the <placeName>

                    and for the personal gallantry of soldiers in the field. The War Department, on the contrary, has
                    been the persistent target of severe criticism. Its highest civilian and uniformed officials have
                    been charged with gross mismanagement, ineptitude, and even corruption. Indeed, they have been held
                    responsible for everything from defective strategy and obsolete <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-068-4-064"/>
                    weaponry to inadequate sanitation facilities and "embalmed beef" rations. Graham
                    A. Cosmas, the author of this impressive volume, contends that this traditional interpretation rests
                    largely upon the works of soldier-memoirists and newspaper correspondents who possessed little first
                    hand knowledge of the inner workings of the War Department or the pressures which influenced its
                    decisions and policies. Through extensive research in the voluminous files of the department,
                    especially those of the offices of the adjutant general and quartermaster general, Cosmas presents
                    "the War Department's story of the war" (p. 2), which substantially
                    modifies the view based upon the works of such field observers as Theodore Roosevelt and Richard
                    Harding Davis.</p>
            <p>Appropriately the first third of this volume is devoted to an analysis of developments in
                    organization and strategy which influenced the War Department during the twenty years before the <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                        </placeName>
                    </hi> exploded in Havana harbor. Despite repeated economy drives in Congress, the disruptive effects
                    of national guard lobbyists, and conflicts in the command system, the department in 1898 approached
                    the war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> with competent if not brilliant professional soldiers in charge of its administrative
                    bureaus and with a "well worked-out plan" for the mobilization and employment of
                    the land forces. But as Cosmas points out, the department also entered the crisis with several
                    important weaknesses: the highest leadership—Secretary of War Russell A. Alger and
                    Commanding General Nelson A. Miles—left much to be desired in terms of ability and
                    character; supply stockpiles were inadequate; trained commanders and staffs for large forces were
                    not available; and the established theories of organization and strategy in the regular army ran
                    counter to the political, diplomatic, and naval realities of the developing conflict. Both army and
                    navy planners assumed that the political objective of a war with <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> would be to assist the Cubans in driving out the Spaniards and in establishing an
                    independent nation. They therefore considered such a war primarily a naval problem with "no
                    major ground action" required of the army. But changes in the diplomatic situation and in
                    political objectives, as well as pressure from state militia organizations regarding a volunteer
                    army, forced the War Department to abandon its original plan and embark upon a wholly new course at
                    the last minute.</p>
            <p>In assessing the department's performance during the war, Cosmas carefully analyzes each
                    military decision regarding the raising and deploying of troops within the fluid political and
                    diplomatic context in which such decisions were made. The army, he insists, suffered from the
                    constantly changing demands imposed upon it by President William McKinley's vacillating
                    strategy and war aims. Without obscuring the errors committed by the War Department or <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-068-4-065"/> claiming for its officials virtues which they did not possess, Cosmas
                    argues convincingly that "the Army's wartime misfortunes resulted less from
                    fundamental mistakes in policy than from efforts to implement sound policies too rapidly with too
                    few trained men and with inadequate stockpiles of supplies" (pp. 3–4). Despite
                    all the charges of incompetence, he concludes, the hardworking, conscientious officials of the War
                    Department had by late 1898 solved most of the problems responsible for the "comedy of
                    blunders" enacted during the invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName>. Largely through improvisation they developed an efficient military administration and
                    forged "an army of empire," providing a solid base for Alger's successor,
                    Elihu Root, to build a modern staff and command system.</p>

                    on authorities, index. $7.95.)</head>
            <p>Even as some southern Negroes sought to achieve personal security, civil rights, and political power
                    during Reconstruction, many black laborers were becoming mired in a system of debt known as peonage.
                    Regardless of its origins—whether it grew naturally out of antebellum slavery or whether
                    employers distorted customs and laws to create debt servitude—peonage was quietly
                    accepted by most southerners. For employers, it represented a way of controlling workers; for those
                    caught in its grip, it was a bewildering system which could not be escaped without the risk of
                    beatings, imprisonment, or perhaps even death.</p>
            <p>Professor Daniel's book is about this largely ignored form of twentieth century slavery. In
                    a series of case studies and histories, the author recreates the harsh and frightening world of
                    peonage. He reveals vividly how debt servitude denied numerous black workers the fundamental right
                    to move about and seek higher wages in an effort to escape from grinding debt and poverty.</p>
            <p>Daniel's study is also in part "the record of an American failure —the
                    inability of federal, state, and local law-enforcement officials to end peonage" (p. xi).
                    Though debt servitude was outlawed by federal statute in 1867, government officials moved timidly
                    against peonage and continually failed to stamp it out. In attempting to <pb n="348" id="VAA4025-068-4-066"/> explain this failure, Daniel observes: "Perhaps these men were
                    convinced that the progression of successful yet inexorable court cases signified that peonage was
                    dying out, or possibly they were traduced by the notion of American innocence that precluded slavery
                    by definition, or more likely they were simply blinded by institutional apathy" (p. xi). In
                    any event, those peonage cases that did go to court were frequently characterized by disappearing
                    witnesses and acquitted employers.</p>
            <p>The author notes that the federal Justice Department still receives numerous peonage complaints each
                    year, few of which are actually investigated. He maintains that peonage persists for several
                    reasons: racist traditions in the South, the apathy—and sometimes
                    corruption—of law enforcement officers, and the impotence of various government agencies
                    in prosecuting this particular violation of federal law.</p>
            <p>In preparing this study, Daniel has drawn extensively on the complaints, correspondence between local
                    federal attorneys and the attorney general, trial transcripts, clippings, briefs, and miscellaneous
                    material in the peonage collection of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Justice. Much information was derived from state and federal reports,
                    annotated codes, briefs and records of Supreme Court cases involving peonage, contemporary magazine
                    articles, and assorted manuscript collections. Utilizing such materials to the best advantage,
                    Daniel has produced a readable and informative work which contributes to an understanding of a
                    little known form of modern day slavery.</p>

            <p>The extensive list of studies dealing with American intervention in the First World War has been
                    enhanced by Professor Gregory's small volume. Although he does not claim to present a great
                    deal of new information, the author, who has written the book primarily for students rather than
                    specialists, believes it is justified because it may shed light on how the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> got to its present position in world affairs and where it is headed. What makes this
                    brief study especially worthwhile is Gregory's realization that American <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-068-4-067"/> policy did not take place in a vacuum. Decisions made by Sir Edward
                    Grey in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Bethmann Hollweg in Berlin affected decisions made in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> as he clearly demonstrates.</p>
            <p>Although the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> did not enter the war until 1917, long before that time American policies had an impact
                    upon the conflict. Gregory submits that the timing of American entrance was significant and argues
                    that the course of the war would have been different if the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had entered at a different time or not at all. Gregory demonstrates that commerce
                    played a major role in gradually drawing the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> into a web from which it could not extricate itself without choosing war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>. Had the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> severed all economic ties with Europe it might have been able to remain neutral, but
                    such a course would have been economically disasterous by 1916. The American desire to continue
                    commerce with the warring nations inevitably helped the allies who controlled the seas. Gregory
                    believes that Wilson and most Americans may have been suspicious of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> militarism even before the war, but that they were willing to tolerate <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> brutality and "uncivilized" warfare (e.g., the burning of Louvain) as
                    long as it did not affect American interests. Submarine warfare was the main reason for
                    intervention, but if the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had not traded with the allies <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> would have had no reason to use it. The problem with Americans, as Gregory points out,
                    was that they believed that they could have trade and peace too. They did not really understand that
                    commerce would lead to war.</p>
            <p>Gregory disagrees with "realist" scholars like George Kennan who suggest that since
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> was destined to enter the war it should have done so earlier. The author argues
                    correctly that Wilson, whom he treats sympathetically though judiciously, could not have accepted
                    such an assumption and that there was insufficient popular and congressional support for an earlier
                    entry. Gregory believes that Wilson's personality was exceptionally complex and should not
                    be overgeneralized. Throughout, Wilson appears as a man not fully aware of the power at his
                    disposal, struggling to avoid a dreaded war, irritated with Britain's arrogant handling of
                    American rights, enraged by <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>'s infringements on the seas and elsewhere. There is pathos in
                    Wilson's agony as he hoes a faltering, though generally pro-ally, neutral line and carries
                    on a tortured diplomacy searching for an honorable way out.</p>

            <p>William E. Borah is among that small band of senators who have left their names etched on the
                    nation's memory. Noted for his courage and eloquence in defending unpopular causes, he
                    reached the peak of his prominence during the 1920s. It is with this period in Borah's
                    senatorial career that LeRoy Ashby deals.</p>
            <p>Opening with a splendid summary of recent thought on the nature of progressivism, Ashby analyzes
                    Borah's record and his relations with other progressives from the beginning of the Harding
                    administration through the election of 1928. Ashby's objective is to demonstrate, by
                    examining the Idaho senator's career, the internal causes of progressivism's
                    failure during the 1920s. He finds many of them. In program, Borah and the other progressive leaders
                    were unable to devise proposals that would both satisfy their rural, individualistic ideals and meet
                    the challenges of modern technology and big business. The progressives could condemn the evils of
                    American society, but they were often reluctant to demand the use of government power and funds to
                    cope with the nation's problems. As a group, they were unable to forge effective alliances
                    with urban liberal forces or even enduring ones among themselves. The progressives were suspicious
                    of power in the hands of others, even other progressives. Moreover, they were frequently distracted
                    by side issues such as prohibition and immigration restriction. They were seldom defenders of the
                    rights of racial minorities.</p>
            <p>Borah, the most prominent of the progressives after La Follette's death in 1925, is a case
                    in point. He was both reluctant to seize leadership and unwilling to accept it from others. A
                    magnificent orator and a skillful publicist, the Idaho senator too often substituted rhetoric for
                    deeds and dashed off on quixotic crusades. He was no organizer, was personally very much the loner,
                    and frequently wavered in his commitments. Moreover, he merchandised pre-World War I ideas in
                    response to the needs of the 1920s. Borah reflected, in brief, the prime shortcomings of
                    progressivism during that decade. He was a prima donna and he was rapidly becoming politically
                    obsolescent.</p>
            <p>In preparing this book, Ashby has used an impressively wide range of manuscripts, newspapers,
                    periodicals, and books. And he has generally used them well, although it is strange that while he
                    delved into fifty-five manuscript collections, he did not make use of materials in the National
                    Archives. One may question his summary treatment of state and local progressive movements. It is
                    also plain <pb n="351" id="VAA4025-068-4-069"/> that he knows considerably less about other American
                    political groups—especially their high degree of disunity during the
                    1920s—than he does about the progressives. Nevertheless, Ashby's volume is an
                    excellent and stimulating analysis of Borah and the problems of progressive leadership. It deserves
                    to be read not only by students of the 1920s and of progressivism but also by those interested in

            <p>This is not a modest, humble book. In it, Lee Benson, professor of history at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, republishes seven of his essays from the years 1957 to 1971 and publishes for the
                    first time a long essay he completed for the book. The essays are arranged chronologically to
                    illustrate the development of his ideas and to suggest the influences that have affected it. He
                    obviously assumes that his work is important. It is. Benson is the most militant advocate in our day
                    of a scientific historiography. He assumes that history can and must be scientific, attempts to
                    demonstrate that it is not, and tries to explain and remedy this failure.</p>
            <p>The author develops a very negative appraisal of the historical profession. His targets include some
                    of the giants, such as Frederick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Turner, who, he argues, developed a myth rather than a thesis. His attack becomes quite
                    angry and extends to the profession's reward system. Benson is especially critical of
                    "Middle Period" historiography, the field he knows best. Arguing that it has
                    failed to supply generalized and useful knowledge, he focuses much of his attention on its failure
                    to explain the causation of the Civil War. He challenges suggestions that explaining the war is
                    "beyond Man's powers" and insists that it is only "beyond the
                    powers of men working within the confines of the established historiographic and social scientific
                    systems" (p. 307).</p>
            <p>Involved in Benson's critique is a protest against the large influence of
                    "ideological convictions" on the work of historians. He finds each ideology
                    equally harmful and its influence an obstacle to progress, but he does not believe that such
                    influence is unavoidable. Instead, it is a consequence of the present "historiographic
                    system." The system "permits scholars to impose their ideological convictions on
                    the past, unconstrained either by scientific methodology or by the <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-068-4-070"/> sanction of effective penalties if exposed as ideological warriors
                    masquerading in academic garb" (p. 287).</p>
            <p>While very critical of present practices, Benson is an optimist. He assumes that history can become
                    scientific, progressive, and useful. Proposals for change are scattered throughout the essays. They
                    include more systematic efforts to collect data; greater use of quantification; more systematic
                    attention to time, space, and rate dimensions and to problems of concept formation, theory building,
                    and index construction; the development of an adequate methodology for studying the formation,
                    distribution, and political impact of public opinion; the building of good theoretical and
                    analytical models; the rejection of the tradition of "proof by haphazard
                    quotation" (p. 220); the establishment of new organizational structures for research; and a
                    substantial increase in the financial resources devoted to it.</p>
            <p>One need not accept all of Benson's strictures and proposals to conclude that he is an
                    enormously valuable historian. Other members of the profession have accomplished more than he
                    suggests, and he has not demonstrated that the scientific school can produce history that is
                    superior to what we now have. Nevertheless, he and others like him deserve the opportunity to give
                    their claims a fair test.</p>

                    history. In 1858 a crowd in the Western Reserve prevented two Kentucky men from carrying off a Negro
                    identified as an escaped slave. As a result, thirty-seven citizens of the towns of Oberlin and
                    Wellington were indicted in federal court for violating the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. In turn, the <placeName>

                    </placeName> "kidnappers" were indicted under the Ohio statute of 1857 which
                    provided that Negroes could not be removed from the state until the validity of a claim for their
                    service had been established in court. The trials were a cause of general excitement for several
                    months before both prosecutions were discontinued by mutual agreement of the two courts.
                    Shipherd's compilation of newspaper accounts, speeches, digests of court proceedings, and
                    other materials pertaining to the cases appeared shortly after the settlement. From these documents

                    transpired before and during the trials. It is clear from the thoroughly engaging nineteenth century
                    polemical style, however, that what is to be gleaned is a feeling of outrage at the Fugitive Slave
                    Act, which "enforces itself against the conscience and sense of justice which everywhere in

                    reached "its highest <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-068-4-074"/> functional development"
                    (p. 1). Excellent line drawings and photographs illustrate the art of construction and the
                    "uniqueness of certain indigenous forms as well as ... the versatility" of the axe
                    (p. 58). Also interesting and informative are a portfolio of collectors’ axes, a
                    directory of American axe makers since the eighteenth century, and notes on the care and use of
                    axes. It is to be hoped that this volume—touted as an American historical
                    "first"—will be followed by others on this and similar topics. <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> as "The Great Emancipator"; at least one black historian has
                    described him as the "embodiment ... of ... a racist tradition" (p. [ix]); and
                    almost every shade of opinion between these two extremes has been expressed by one or more scholars.
                    In this collection of documents Zilversmit has assembled a varied selection of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s writings, along with statements of his contemporaries, to help readers draw
                    their own conclusions about the President's attitudes toward slavery and race. Included are
                    personal letters to and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, speeches, debates, messages to Congress, editorials, and official proclamations from
                    the period 1837 to 1865. At one debate during his senatorial campaign in 1858 <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> told an audience: "I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in
                    any way the social and political equality of the white and black races ... and I will say in
                    addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I
                    believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political
                    equality" (pp. 47–48). At another time, however, he stated: the Negro
                    "is not my equal in many respects—certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral
                    or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat bread, without leave of anybody else, which his

                    appendix. $12.50). Described on the book jacket as a classic of American Indian reform
                    literature, this volume —first published in 1880—discusses the relationship
                    between whites and Indians from their first contacts on the Atlantic coast through the 1870s.
                    Manypenny, commissioner of Indian affairs from 1853–1857 and chairman of the Sioux
                    Commission in 1876, believed "that from the time of earliest settlement in America, Indian
                    wars had been caused by the white man's rapacity ..." (p. xvii). His book records
                    the many broken treaties, successive removals, and uprootings during the nineteenth century,
                    dishonest government officials, destruction of the buffalo, and proposed extermination of
                    recalcitrant tribes. Manypenny opposed any attempt to transfer the Indian Bureau from the Department
                    of Interior back to the War Department and in <hi rend="i">Our Indian Wards</hi> set out to
                    illustrate from the historical record that the army was unsuited to take any part in Indian affairs.
                    He also suggested that the federal government adopt a policy of dealing with Indians as wards rather
                    than recognizing chiefs as spokesmen for quasi-independent nations and he proposed land-in-severalty
                    legislation to make homesteaders of Indians within reservations. The value of this reprinted volume
                    is underscored by the fact that Manypenny's plea in the 1880s is even more pertinent today:
                    "Is is not time that a change should take place? Is it not time that the
                    government and people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should resolve that justice and fair dealing shall be substituted for coldness, sordid
                    selfishness, and cruelty which the native race has endured in all the years of the past"
