            The Impact of the Civil War upon Hoosier Society
            KENNETH M. STAMPP
            
            The morning of May 3, 1865, found the Republican 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal in a pensive mood as it looked back over the Civil War years which had so
                    recently closed. "We wonder at what we have endured, we wonder at what we have
                    achieved," it reflected. "We know as never before why we are blinded as to the
                    future. Could we have… anticipated the great price we would have to pay for the
                    maintenance of our integrity, we would have shrunk in dismay from the contest, or entered upon it
                    with hearts unutterably heavy."
            In sharp contrast was the gay holiday spirit which permeated Indiana in the spring of 1861 as the
                    state bustled about the business of mobilizing for war. Amid the early martial enthusiasm there were
                    few who anticipated the long and sanguinary struggle ahead. The eager volunteers who filled the
                    three months' regiments—and the politicians who sanctified their
                    cause—envisioned a war of short duration, a pleasant summer campaign, followed by the
                    swift collapse of the Confederacy. With that accomplished, they expected a quick return to peace, to
                    "the Union as it was," and to the suspended but still unsettled political issues.
                    The war was being prosecuted only to preserve the Union, "with all the dignity, equality,
                    and rights of the several States unimpaired" ran the Crittenden resolution which was
                    endorsed, in July, 1861, by every Indiana congressman.1 Thus, having little
                    cognition of the social dynamics implicit in the war itself, the Hoosiers were hardly prepared for
                    the profound changes that were soon to overtake Indiana and the nation.
            As the months wore on, however, and the prospect of

                            222–23.
               
                     peace and reunion appeared ever more remote, the citizens of
                    Indiana ultimately perceived that the old order was changing—that "the Union as
                    it was" would be no more. Denied a clear perspective by the distraction of clashing armies
                    and angry politicians, few men grasped the full meaning of those momentous changes. It became
                    increasingly clear that "hence-forth the Americans will be a different people,"2 and that the country was entering upon "a new stage of
                        being."3 Thus, while the war experience was being woven into the
                    fabric of state and national heritage, its impact was transforming every aspect of Hoosier society.
            The local beneficiaries of change welcomed these revolutionary appurtenances of military strife and
                    pronounced them good. The war too they blessed as a "refining ordeal" which would
                    develop "the virtues of the American people." Denying that it would have any ill
                    effects upon popular institutions, they insisted that the nation would "from the crucible
                    of war and the sacrifice of blood, present a more perfect civilization… than the world
                    has ever seen."4
            
            This happy picture of a regenerate people with souls cleansed by a bath of blood, however, was at
                    best a distortion of the Indiana scene during those four long years of war. Instead the state
                    presented a variegated mosaic of heroic, self-sacrificing patriotism and unblushing avarice, of warm
                    idealism and calloused cynicism.
            Noble indeed was the general devotion to the soldiers' welfare portrayed by the untiring
                    zeal of state sanitary workers, the sanitary fairs, the women's auxiliary societies, the
                    church organizations of every denomination, and the independent activity of young and old alike.5 Commendable too were the efforts stimulated by Governor Oliver P. Morton in
                    behalf of the destitute families of the volunteers.6 For that purpose
                    soldiers' aid societies were formed, thousands of loaves of bread were distributed from the
                    state bakery, theaters presented benefit performances, and farmers frequently

                     brought in generous contributions of food and fuel in long
                    processions of heavily laden wagons.7 Such endeavors were the manifestations of
                    a social consciousness and cooperative spirit which in that individualistic age prior to the war had
                    been all but dormant.
            In contrast there was, unfortunately, in this war-time society a grim and morbid motif which predominated throughout the conflict. It was revealed in the suffering and
                    privation of broken families deprived of their means of support, and in the many tragic letters to
                    the governor appealing for material aid.8 It appeared again in the terrible
                    anxiety about the safety of loved ones after every battle, in the growing lists of native sons who
                    were killed in action or died of disease, and in the desperate efforts of relatives to visit the
                    sick and wounded in military hospitals.9 At home the original horror at the
                    sight of mutilated men and of the coffins which so frequently lined the walls of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     depot was gradually deadened as people became hardened and habituated to such
                    incidences of war.
            Moreover, the appeal to arms appeared to be at least as conducive to the development of vice as it
                    was of virtue. In Indiana's bustling capital city the business of war preparations brought
                    in its wake a decided slackening of moral standards. Gambling and heavy drinking were common;
                    painted women plied their trade unmolested except for the occasional invasion of their premises by
                    mobs of drunken soldiers who turned them into shambles. Crime grew apace. Newspapers were filled
                    with accounts of street brawls, of the depredations of bands of lawless men, of murders and
                        thefts.10
            
            Behind the lines, in Indiana as elsewhere, people witnessed the unhappy spectacle of men growing rich
                    from their ccuntry's misfortunes, too often without scrupling about the means by which they
                    amassed their wealth. When state bonds were sold to raise money for military purposes complaints

                     were heard that local bankers and capitalists dealt too harshly
                    with their government by demanding excessive discounts.11 The unsavory practices
                    of men connected with the early business of the state commissary and quartermaster departments
                    revealed a confusing mixture of inexperience, incompetence and actual peculation.12 Hoosier soldiers and civilians knew well the sordid story of shoddy contractors who made
                    huge profits by swindling state and national governments in filling the much coveted war orders.
                    Governor Morton's complaints about guns that could be shaken to pieces and about Austrian
                    rifles that became worthless after a week's use sketched a shameful picture of the rankest
                    knavery. To have sent men to the field with such weapons, he once protested, would have been
                    "little better than murder."13 Small wonder then that some
                    defined the conflict as a "contractor's war" and cried out against the
                    patriots who had "enriched themselves out of the… very miseries of the
                    country." But the Democratic 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel mourned that when one protested against fraud and corruption, Such
                    scoundrels "set upon him with the howl that he is ‘disloyal,’ that he
                    ‘sympathizes with the rebellion.’"14
            
            Meanwhile, heavy taxes and the inevitable war-time inflation brought distress to men with fixed
                    salaries and to soldiers who had to support their families upon an income of thirteen dollars a
                    month. Governor Morton described the situation succinctly in an appeal to Congress in November,
                    1862, which urged an increase in pay for the volunteers. He

                     noted that clothing prices had risen 120 per cent, while food
                    prices had risen 60 per cent.15 Hence the war was a time of stringency for many
                    Hoosier families who were often obliged to subsist upon food substitutes such as parched rye in
                    place of coffee.16
            
            These destitute families made an unhappy contrast with the men who prospered and lived accordingly.
                    Indeed, for some the war was a period of lavish living, elaborate entertainments and material
                    abundance. The dissatisfied called it an era of "criminal extravagance… without
                    a parallel" and asserted that the (Lresources of the nation are being wasted in riotous
                        living."17 These were inauspicious beginnings for the
                    nation's "new stage of being."
            While it appeared thus doubtful that the war would produce a purified people, it was clear enough
                    that vast economic changes were sweeping across Indiana and the nation. The ancient struggle between
                    the dogmas of Democracy and Whiggery had not abated, but the former's concepts of political
                    economy, so long predominant, were forced to yield before the onslaughts of triumphant
                    Republicanism. Ruefully the Hoosier Jacksonians watched the bulwarks of their system crumble away as
                    the hated principles of their foes emerged to rule the country.
            In southern Indiana the devotees of the old order—the boat builders, the merchants and
                    farmers whose prosperity had long hinged upon the river trade—complained bitterly against
                    the obstruction of their river outlet, and occasionally they defiantly engaged in contraband trade
                    with the South. They refused to abandon their abiding suspicion of railroad transpbrtation and
                    attributed all their adversities to grasping Eastern capitalists.18 During the

                     regulation which foreshadowed a new field of political
                    controversy and the post-war revolt of Western farmers.19
            
            Yet the declining river interests could not ignore the fact that the paths of commerce were changing,
                    that the demands of Europe and the East had diverted much of their trade, and that consolidating
                    railroads were growing up to the needs of the country. Nor did they miss the fact that the war would
                    strike a deadly blow at their Southern market, for they saw that the South would be impoverished and
                    its old economy destroyed.20 The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal mocked those who clung to the tradition of Western dependence upon the
                    South. It pointed to the rapid growth of northern Indiana where there was no prejudice against the
                    "Yankee," and noted that the Eastern and Southern markets could not be compared
                    "with the arithmetic of five years ago."21 Manifestly, in the
                    debate between river and railroad interests the former group appeared more and more to speak only
                    from a sentimental attachment to a tradition that was fast losing its bearing upon fact.
            Additional evidence of economic change appeared in the transformation of banking institutions during
                    the war period. Secession had been a severe blow to Indiana's free banks which had invested
                    heavily in Southern state bonds.22 The state bank too had difficulties when the
                    depreciation of legal tender notes caused a rapid rise in the value of gold and forced that
                    institution, in the spring of 1862, to suspend specie payments.23 These blows to
                    local banking and the issuance of large quantities of "greenbacks" grated upon the
                    sensibilities of Jacksonian Democrats who were apprehensive about further departures from their
                    cherished economic principles. They protested against the growth of a "political money
                    power" whose financial policies were allegedly based upon "a foundation of
                    sand," and predicted the imminence of economic ruin and the collapse of government
                        credit.24

            The dismay of Indiana Democrats reached its climax early in 1863 with the establishment of a new
                    system of national banking. To them it epitomized the abandonment of Democratic economic doctrines
                    and the resurrection. of the most detested of all Whig heresies. Other Hoosiers, however, including
                    some wealthy Democrats, welcomed the new banking system. Beginning with the First National Bank of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , directed by William H. English, a network of these institutions quickly covered the
                    state. By 1862 Indiana possessed thirty-one national banks which had all but won the field from the
                    state institutions. Indeed, most branches of the state bank ultimately obtained national bank
                        charters.25 Nothing more clearly exemplified the role of "war
                    necessity" as an instrument of social revolution than did these changes in the American
                    banking system.
            Meanwhile the foes of economic change nursed a bitter resentment against the revival of the
                    protective tariff. The Morrill tariff of 1861—"a model of political
                    thieving"—received censorious treatment in countless Democratic resolutions, and Western
                    Republicans who accepted this and subsequent tariff increases were branded as apostates to their
                        section.26 Thomas A. Hendricks and Daniel W. Voorhees repeatedly scourged
                    the Eastern manufacturers who exploited the West with the protective tariff and sought to make its
                    people "the ‘hewers of wood and drawers of water’ for the capitalists
                    of New England and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ."27
            
            Lumping together these portentous economic developments, the defenders of the old order pointed to
                    the destruction

                     of their so-called "sound principles of political
                    economy" as proof of the hypocrisy of Republican professions of wartime
                        non-partisanship.26 "The spirit of our institutions have [sic] been
                    changed since the war began," observed the Sentinel,
                    "… and revolutions never go backward."29 Indeed, in
                    the opinion of this newspaper, the Republicans prosecuted the war "solely with the hope
                    that a new order of things… will be its end."30 "A
                    long war is their elysium," it added, for without it "all their fancy schemes for
                    taxing, banking and plundering would pass away…."31 Demo
                    crats predicted the growth of a Northern financial aristocracy as the end result of current
                    Republican policies. "Mr. Chase says the aristocrats of the South lord it over black
                    men," observed the Sentinel, "but what will the people gain if
                    there is substituted in its place an aristocracy that will domineer over white men?"32
            
            In spite of the dolorous Democratic predictions that the nation was heading toward economic collapse,
                    the sponsors of the new order increased and prospered. With all its accompanying changes and
                    dislocations, the war still brought an unprecedented degree of prosperity to Indiana. Widening
                    markets meant high prices for the products of her farms, and agriculture flourished and expanded as
                    never before. The recruiting of armies left a shortage of man power which improved the bargaining
                    position of labor.33 Local railroads, like all other commercial enterprises, did
                    a thriving business and made handsome profits. The closure of the rivers and the transportation of
                    troops and military supplies enabled many lines to extinguish long-standing debts and to appreciate
                    greatly the value of their stocks.34
            
            The invigorating influence of the war was especially noticeable at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . As the center of the state's war activities the capital city more than
                    doubled in size, untii, by the end of 1864, it boasted a population of 45,000. Old industries
                    expanded rapidly, and new establishments sprang

                     up in mushroom fashion. The city's growing business
                    section invaded older residential districts, new buildings shot up, and hundreds of houses were
                    erected to meet the needs of the fast growing population. 
                        Indianapolis
                     was indeed a roaring, booming, prosperous Western metropolish.35 In
                    the midst of all this activity the Journal noted contentedly that "the
                    nation wages war and prospers!"36
            
            That Indiana was undergoing an economic transformation was thus apparent enough even to
                    contemporaries; that, the time-honored precepts of agrarian economy were being destroyed was clearly
                    perceived by the friends of the old order. Jefferson's Democracy might still idealize rural
                    virtues and envision Indiana's future in terms of prosperous farms and peaceful villages;
                    but the dreams of others were woven with ribbons of steel, colored by the smoke of factories and
                    filled with humming machines. Enterprising Hoosiers were not slow to catch the dynamic spirit of
                    industrial capitalism, nor to transform the fabric of dreams into the tough web of fact. Sturdy
                    farmers were feeling the mettle of their industrial rivals as Indiana marched with the nation toward
                    a new economic era.37
            
            With the conflict assuming the proportions of a protracted and gigantic struggle accompanied by
                    significant modifications of American institutions, the original concept of a war based upon the
                    Crittenden resolution appeared somewhat puerile. Hence, to counter their critics, the local
                    protagonists of war and national change proceeded to formulate a greater moral justification for
                    their cause. Gradually their propaganda organizations unfolded and described before Hoosier citizens
                    a series of issues and objectives which placed the war upon a high level of moral grandeur.

                     sons fought and died thereafter for something fa:. more sublime
                    than the mere preservation of the Union.
            President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation afforded the local war propagandists an
                    opportunity to raise one grand moral issue. Despite their early conservatism upon the slavery
                    question, by the summer of 1863 Indiana Republicans and their party press had passed from the
                    argument of "military necessity" to. a justification of the act on the principles
                    of human liberty. They discovered in the slave system the basic cause of the war and began to speak
                    in terms of an irrepressible conflict between slavery and freedom.
            Governor Morton first took this higher ground in defense of emancipation in a speech at an 
                        Indianapolis
                     meeting held to celebrate the fall of Vicksburg.38 The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal marked its advance to the new position with the assertion that
                    Lincoln's proclamation "made the present contest… a struggle in behalf
                    of human liberty and against slavery." Moreover, it contended, "between the
                    hostile principles of Freedom and Slavery… there can of necessity be no permanent
                        peace."39
            
            More than freedom was at stake, however, for it appeared that the nation fought also for
                    self-preservation, for the very existence of its government and constitution.40
                    The war, too, supposedly involved the great issue "between tlic Democratic principle and
                    the aristocratic principle."41 The South had gone to war, asserted
                    Governor Morton in a Fourth of July oration, to subvert the very foundations of the Declaration of
                    Independence and to destroy democratic institutions.42 Thus, summarized the Journal, the North fought "against one of the most cruel and profligate
                    despotisms in the history of time—against a blasphemous

                            and, like the abolitionists, "he is for a new Union, a new Constitution, a new
                            bible and a new God." July 9, 1863.

                     attempt to rear an empire on the corner stone of human slavery.
                    We are fighting for national existence, for good government, for law and order, for liberty and
                        civilization."43
            
            With such a complete monopoly of human virtue, who could doubt where God's sympathies lay?
                    In noting certain facts worthy "the gratitude of every Christian," the Journal observed that "the unanimity of the pulpit… in
                    prosecution of this war… is itself an assurance of the justice of the war."
                    Surely it revealed "the presence of God's own spirit."44 General Carxington, in a public letter to the Legion of Johnson county, also insisted that
                    "God is with us," and that the South fought against Him as well as against the
                    North. "If one with God be a majority," he exulted, "how are we fortified
                    by the belief that God has brought this war upon us to purify the nation…. "45 Indeed, cried Morton, "we are now fighting in the holiest cause that
                    ever engaged the attention of the world."46
            
            Yet, despite the contemporary justification of the conflict in terms of great moral issues, the Civil
                    War had a strange and appalling effect upon the minds of Hoosiers. The bitter dispute between the
                    champions and opponents of social and economic change, the inevitable physical and mental distress
                    experienced by a nation at war, and the effectiveness of Union propaganda transformed many people
                    into blind and intransigent fanatics. The war itself unleashed the forces which too often overcame
                    the powers of rational thought. Behind the lines men ceased to think and only hated, for the virus
                    of war psychosis poisoned the minds of leaders and people alike.
            The first effect of Northern propaganda was to give to Southerners the shape of human monsters, and
                    to raise among loyal patriots a burning desire for national revenge. After a few short months of war
                    the usually mild mannered Senator Henry S. Lane harangued an 
                        Indianapolis
                     audience with a venomous attack upon the South. "Blood must be shed,"
                    he ranted, "and rebel blood profusely shed, for we read that there is no remission of sins
                    without the shedding of blood."47

            Overcome by the miasma of war, Republican speakers and newspapers unfolded, after each battle, a
                    familiar and repetitious pattern of atrocity stories. They began with the first battle of Bull Run
                    where the "rebel barbarians" were alleged to have robbed the Union dead, fired
                    upon hospitals "with their freight of groaning wounded," and
                    "pierced… with their bayonets" the wounded on the field. The loyal
                    press described the execution of this diabolical work as so systematic as to leave no doubt that it
                    was done by the orders of rebel commanders whose purpose was extermination.48
                    After numerous rehearsals of such accounts, the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Gazette concluded that no people in history "ever exhibited that fiendish
                    malignity, that savage cruelty, and that utter want of honor and respect for the laws and customs of
                    war, that have characterized the people of the South…."49
                    Southerners "are only about semi-civilized," raged the Journal,
                    "and do not therefore understand that war is not necessarily barbarous."50
            
            The effects of such outpourings upon an agitated people were shown in the numerous printed letters of
                    angry patriots who found release for their malevolence in demands for punitive measures of
                    retaliation, perhaps "a little more shooting, and not quite so much capturing."51 When, early in 1862, Confederate prisoners were brought to Camp Morton,
                    complaints were heard that the rebels were being treated too well.52 Such bitter
                    feelings were deepened by Union officers who returned from Confederate prisons to lecture upon their
                    inhuman treatment during their confinement in the South."53 These were
                    the sinews which strengthened the will to fight.

                        were pampered. At Camp Morton they were housed in barracks constructed from lumber used for
                        cattle sheds, provided only with inferior clothing, and fed with the "utmost

            War psychosis was not only manifested in the Hoosiers' attitude toward the South, but also
                    in a morbid suspicion of those at home whose opinions did not coincide with their own. Men whose
                    political ends were served by inoculating the community with tales of domestic treason often
                    succumbed ultimately to the infection of their own puissant drug. Loyal citizens lived in panicky
                    fear of their own neighbors, and lumped all dissenters in the single category of traitors.
                    Intellectual tolerance was not the order of the day.
            With the assurance that peace could come only "through the red gates of war,"54 the Journal informed its readers that unless a man gave
                    unqualified support to the war and was "openly, heartily, and intensely loyal, he is
                    suspected of secession proclivities…."55 Upon that premise
                    Union party advocates repeatedly indicted the Democracy with disloyalty. The evidence advanced by
                    excited partisans was that Democrats divided northern councils and thus prevented the suppression of
                    the rebellion, that they supposedly made no contribution to the sanitary commission, that they cried
                    out for free speech only to enable them to spread their treason, that all Knights of the Golden
                    Circle were Democrats, that all rebels were Democrats—indeed, that it was a Democratic
                        rebellion.56
            
            The columns of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Journal were filled with accounts of the military drills and traitorous plots of secret
                    Democratic societies to illustrate "that the State is, as Governor Morton strikingly
                    expressed it, ‘perfectly cavernous’ with disloyal organizations."57 The Republican press printed every rumor and wild report sent in by frenzied
                    patriots of conspiracies being hatched among their neighbors, of secret aid to the rebels, and of
                    the shameful persecution of Union men. The authors of these letters expressed horror at men who
                    boldly wore copperhead emblems, and who were so depraved as to "glory in being
                    butternuts." There were numerous demands that all such traitors be arrested and

                    out" through the action of Vigilance Committees.58 In stumping the
                    state for the Sanitary Commission the ebullient Chaplain Lozier vowed that "wherever I find
                    a ‘copperhead’ I shall, in the name of God and the Hoosier soldiers,
                    ‘bruise the serpent's head.’"59
            
            Additional alarming letters poured in upon the governor from every quarter of the state. They
                    described the activities of Democrats who cursed Union men and cheered for "Jeff"
                    Davis, and reported the drills and meetings of treasonable societies in adjoining townships and
                    counties. Some professed to possess large stores of information with which they hoped to aid the
                    governor in the exposure of the Knights of the Golden Circle. It was characteristic of these
                    letters, filled as they were with rumors in the absence of facts, to reflect numerous local feuds
                    and the agitation and illiteracy of their authors rather than the treason they pretended to
                        expose."60 The general war hysteria was equally well portrayed in
                    the correspondence of Republican secret societies whose members appeared to regard themselves as the
                    last bulwark against domestic revolution.61
            
            Public leaders were at least as great alarmists as were their constituents. In the summer of 1862
                    Governor Morton wrote a panicky letter to Secretary of War Stanton which described a secret
                    treasonable society in Indiana with 10,000 members organized to "circulate and foster
                    newspapers of extremely doubtful loyalty." The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Sentinel, he declared, was "as thoroughly opposed to our Government as
                    the 
                        Charleston

                    private secretary that domestic conditions were such that no additional troops could be spared

                        emergency.63
            
            Similarly, military officials in Indiana often succumbed to the general excitement and conducted
                    themselves as though they resided in the heart of the Confederacy. Conrad Baker, assistant provost
                    marshal general for Indiana, reported to his chief that the "disloyal element under the
                    name ‘Democracy’" was having great success in its efforts to arm and
                    drill its friends.64 General Carrington, who also received a full quota of
                    communications regarding domestic treason,65 reported to the president and
                    secretary of war, early in 1863, that the local Knights of the Golden Circle were organized
                    "to break up the army." He sent them an elaborate description of that
                    society's secrets and objectives which embodied most of the current newspaper reports. It
                    was his belief that the local Knights had a membership of 92,000, and that Vallandigharn could have
                    raised 20,000 armed traitors in the state without trouble.66
            
            From this welter of rumors concerning domestic disloyalty there emerged nothing more substantial than
                    isolated instances of local disorder, and these—the Republican press
                    notwithstanding—were the fruits of the general hysteria, of lawless bands associated with
                    neither party, of refractory soldiers and personal feuds, rather than of any widespread treasonable
                        conspiracy.67 Whatever significance was attached to the Dodd conspiracy of
                    1864 by Union party politicians, the fact still remained that no insurrection ever materialized and
                    that the subsequent "treason trials" failed to reveal the evidence of an overt
                        act.68 Secret Democratic societies there were, but they were equally popular
                    among Republicans, and each group claimed to have organized for defense against the other. To a

                        Malta
                     and defunct Know Nothings. In Indiana, then, the everlasting cry of treason had meaning
                    only in terms of war psychosis and of political strategy. It was hardly the manifestation of a
                    people purified by war.
            In all these unfortunate incidences of a war-time society Indiana fared no better than other states.
                    The hardening of men by their close association with suffering and death, the lowering of moral
                    standards, the intensity of partisanship in a period of swift social change, and the evidences of
                    war psychosis were as grim as the war itself. If any elements of "a more perfect
                    civilization" were mixed in the "crucible of war," they were bought at a
                    staggering price.

                        Indianapolis
                    , which became the permanent capital of the Hoosier state in 1825, was one of the best
                    planned cities of the American Middle Western wilderness. This was due. to the location of the
                    capital in the unsettled part of the state, to the grant of four sections of land by the federal
                    government, to the plans evolved by the men employed to lay out and survey the site, and to the
                    accomplishment of these ends in advance of the actual rise of the city. The origin and location of
                    the federal land grant and the revenues arising therefrom during the first decade of statehood made
                    possible the expenditures necessary to the achievement of this early instance of state planning. The
                    record of this development is an interesting and important part of the history of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and of the state.1
            
            When the last territorial Assembly, in December of 1815, petitioned Congress for admission into the
                    Union the latter body was requested to grant donations of land to the future state for various
                    purposes. One of these requested donations was for thirty-six sections of land as a site for a
                    permanent seat of government, which would be located near the center of the state following the
                    removal of the Indian title therefrom.2 In the Enabling Act Congress offered the
                    embryo state but four sections of land as a capital donation, along with other valuable land grants,
                    subject to Indiana's agreeing that Hoosier land thereafter sold from the public domain
                    would be exempt from all taxation for five years from the date of its sale.3 The
                    Corydon Convention accepted

                            , 1916, 1930), I, 69–72. The petition read: "As it is deemed
                            good policy that every State should have its seat of government as nearly central as the
                            local situation of the country will permit, and as such site proper for the permanent seat
                            is not at this time at the disposal of this territory or the general government, it is
                            expected that congress will whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished, grant us a
                            township of 6 miles square to be selected by such persons as the future State may
                            appoint."

                            Ibid., 76–77: "That four sections of land
                            be… granted to the said State for the purpose of fixing their seat of government
                            thereon; 
               
                     the donations and their quid pro quo.4 Indiana was probably the first state to receive a grant of land for a capital
                        site.5
            
            Sundry citizens of 
                        Harrison County
                    , in an attempt to keep the capital at Corydon as long as possible, promised the
                    constitutional convention money and other considerations if Corydon were retained as the capital.6 The details of this oHer are not known, but it apparently induced the
                    constitutional provision that "Corydon, in 
                        Harrison County
                     shall be the seat of Government of the State of Indiana, until the year eighteen
                    hundred and twenty-five, and until removed by law."7 This mandate would
                    probably not have been adopted if its framers had known that the Harrison citizens would fail to
                    fulfill their part of the understanding,8 nor if the constitutional fathers
                    could have foreseen the rapidity with which both the Indian and colonizing frontiers of the state
                    would shift northward.
            
               which four sections shall, under the direction of the legislature of said State, be located,
                        at any time, in such township and range as the legislature aforesaid may select, on such lands
                        as may hereafter he acquired by the 
                            United States
                         from the Indian tribes within the said Territory: Provided, That
                        such locations shall be made prior to the public sales, of the lands of the 
                            United States
                         surrounding such location… Both the 1815 petition and the Enabling Act
                        assumed that the capital could be located on what was then Indian territory. Note that the grant
                        received was not nearly as liberal as that which was requested.

            When Indiana was admitted into the Union the Indian title had not yet been extinguished from the
                    northern and central parts of the state,9 while the territorial census of 1815
                    had reported a population of less than 64,000.10 Following the War of 1812 a
                    flood of immigrants swarmed into Indiana and neighboring states so that the Hoosiers numbered nearly
                    148,000 in 1820.11 By 1830, despite the depression, debts and diseases of the
                    twenties, the total jumped to approximately 345,000 or between five and six times the 1815 count.12 Under these circumstances the Indian frontier was rapidly pushed northward.
                    The New Purchase Treaty of 1818 cleared the Indian title from nearly all of Indiana south of the 
                        Wabash
                    , as well as to some land along the west bank of the same. This cession made it possible
                    for the state Assembly to ponder about the location of the capital, although the Indians were
                    allowed three years to move from the ceded area.13
            
            Governor Jonathan Jennings, one of the three commissioners who negotiated the New Purchase Treaty,
                    advised the 1818–1819 Assembly that it would not be possible to secure the full benefit
                    from the expenditures of the three per cent or internal improvements fund until the new capital was
                        situated.14 Apparently it was realized that many of the main roads should
                    converge at the capital. Early in 1820 the Assembly appointed ten commissioners to select and locate

                            68–69, quoting from Annals, 14 Cong., 1 Sess., 460, gave the total population as
                            63,897. Clarence E. Carter (ed.), Territorial Papers of the 
                                    United States

                                Washington
                            , 1939), 364, indicated a total population of 63,609. Adding to the confusion,
                            Carter indicated, in brackets, that the figure should be 63,809. The Kettleborough statement
                            is based upon a certified statement of William Hendricks, Clerk of the Indiana House of
                            Representatives, while that in Carter is based upon a certified statement of Dennis
                            Pennington, speaker of the Indiana House. Both figures are in substantial agreement,
                            although the returns for individual counties have considerable variation. When statehood was
                            achieved Indiana's population was probably approximately 75,000.

                            p. 22. The 1821 appropriation of —100,000 from the three per cent fund was not
                            made until after the permanent seat of government had been selected.
               
                     a site for the new seat of government.15 The
                    commission performed its task in May and June following and Jennings, although not a member of the
                    commission, accompanied the commissioners in their travels. The site approved was at the junction
                    of, 
                        Fall Creek
                     with the West Fork of White River.16
            
            There were various factors which contributed to the selection of this particular spot. It was
                    reasonably near the geographical center of the state; here the West Fork of White
                    River had elevated banks, an advantage which the commission reported could not be found
                    at a less distance than thirty miles southward; the public land of the surrounding area had not yet
                    been opened to sale; and it was hoped that this place could subsequently be made a point on the
                    National Road. Perhaps the committee was also influenced by a belief that White
                    River would be a navigable stream.17
            
            Incidentally, about the time the capital was being located another commission was busy in 
                        Monroe
                     County selecting an eminence on which there was a spring of water as a suitable place
                    for the location of what soon became the state university.18
            
            Early in 1821 the Assembly approved the location recommended by the commission and decided that the
                    new capital "shall be called and known by the name of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ."19 Tradition has it that some of the old Indian fighters
                    preferred the name "Tecumseh" in honor of the red warrior who died while fighting
                    with the British against the Americans.20 The choice of the legislature was much
                    ridiculed by a 
                        Vincennes
                     newspaper which commented:

                            report was dated June 7, 1820. Commissioner John Tipton kept a journal of the labors of the
                            commission, for which see Indiana Magazine of History, I, 9–15,
                            74–79. B. J. Blythe, clerk to the commission, kept a journal, but it has not been
                            found.

                            363–64; Esarey, History of Indiana, I, 271. According to Dunn:
                            "Gen. Marston G. Clark had proposed ‘Tecumseh,’ before the
                            legislature met, and it had been advocated by some of the newspapers; but this and several
                            other names 
               
                    
                    
                        One of the most ludicrous acts, however, of the sojourners at Corydon, was their naming of
                            the new seat of state government. Such a name, kind readers, you would never find by
                            searching from Dan to Beersheba; nor in all the libraries, museums, and patent-offices in
                            the world. It is like nothing in heaven nor on earth. It is not a name for man, woman, or
                            child; for empire, city, mountain or morass; for bird, beast, fish, nor creeping thing; and
                            nothing mortal or immortal could have thought of it, except the wise men of the East who
                            were congregated at Corydon. It is composed of the following letters:—
                        I-N-D-I-A-N-A-P-O-L-I-S!
                        Pronounce it as you please, gentle readers—you can do it as you
                            wish—there is no danger of violating any system or rule, either in accent,
                            cadence, or emphasis—suit your own convenience, and be thankful you are enabled
                            to do it, by this rare scholastic genius of the age. For this title your future capital will
                            be greatly indebted, either to some learned Hebraist, some venerable Grecian, some sage and sentimental Brahmin, or some
                            profound and academic Pauttowattimie.21
                  
                    
            
            The statute which named the capital also appointed Christopher Harrison, first lieutenant governor of
                    the state, and two others a committee to lay out the donation having "specially in view the
                    health, utility and beauty of the place."22 Alexander Ralston and Elias
                    P. Fordham were engaged to survey the donation. Ralston had previously aidecl in platting the
                    federal capital at 
                        Washington
                     City, while Fordham was an Englishman from Birbeck's 
                        Illinois
                     colony. The design followed was probably suggested by Ralston, perhaps 
                  were rejected by the House, and ‘
                                Indianapolis
                            ’ was adopted." Esarey wrote: "Nothing came up
                            during that session of the General Assembly that provoked such acrimonious debate and such
                            merriment as naming the new capital. A strong effort was made to name the new town Tecumseh.
                            Some of the old Indian fighters, as Marston Clark of 
                                Salem
                            , urged that name. The name ‘
                                Indianapolis
                            ’ is said to have been suggested by Jeremiah Sullivan of 
                                Madison
                            , and accepted as a compromise." Neither Esarey nor Dunn make any
                            citations to supporting references. The name Tecumseh does not appear to have been voted cn
                            by either housq of the Assembly; see Journal of the House,
                            1820–1821, and the Journal of the Senate of Indiana,
                            1820–1821. The writer has gone through the files of several early Indiana
                            newspapers, but has not found any paper which discussed the name Tecumseh. The Tecumseh
                            tradition, however, may have a factual basis.

                     survey.23 Ralston was reported as saying that,
                    "‘it could make a beautiful city, if it were ever
                        built.’"24 The circle, near the center of the grant, was
                    reserved as a suitable place for the erection of a house for the chief executive of the state. The
                    present converging avenues of

                        Massachusetts
                     were laid out and named. Nearly every state, then in the Union, was recognized in the
                    naming of the other principal streets, while the two streets which intersected at the circle were
                    called Market and Meridian. Space was reserved for the subsequent erection of a state capitol, a
                    county courthouse, and other public buildings.25
            
            The lots of the donation were numbered and were rectangular save for the necessary exceptions such as
                    caused by the meandering of Pogue's Run and the irregularities resulting from the four
                    converging avenues. Harrison and the other commissioners were authorized to advertise and sell as
                    many lots as they deemed expedient, "reserving unsold every second odd number."
                    Lots were to be sold at auction to the highest bidder and purchasers were required to pay one-fifth
                    in cash, with the residue payable in four equal annual installments. An eight per cent discount was
                    to be allowed on each yearly payment received on time and six per cent interest was to be collected
                    on all delinquent payments.26
            
            An 
                        Indianapolis
                     Agency was organized with an officer in charge who was usually designated as the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Agent or the Agent of State for 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It was his duty to attend sales of lots, receive revenues of the agency, keep proper
                    records, prosecute those who wasted timber on unsold lots and resell forfeited lots. The agent was
                    to receive an annual salary of —600, which was more than the compensation then allowed to
                    either the auditor or treasurer

                     of state.27 Finally, it was stated that,
                    "The monies arising from the sale of lots shall remain in the treasury and constitute a
                    fund for the special purpose of erecting the necessary public buildings of the state."28 Thus arose the first, public building fund of the state which was generally
                    called the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund.
            John Carr, an early settler of 
                        Jeffersonville
                     who fought with Harrison at 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , was elected the first agent.29 He supervised the initial sale of
                    donation lots in October, 1821, at which time three hundred and fourteen lots were sold for a total
                    purchase price of about —35,500, or at slightly more than —113 each.30 In 1822, Carr was authorized to lease a ferry across White
                    River, to rent that portion of the donation on the west bank of the same, to lease unsold
                    lots to persons agreeing to clear the timber therefrom and to sell not exceeding two acres to any
                    person or persons who would make brick for the improvement of the town. This legislation also
                    reduced the agent's salary to —300 yearly.31
            
            With a suddenness that is startling 
                        Indianapolis
                     became conscious of its claims upon the state for what the pioneers commonly called the
                    loaves and fishes of office. After the August, 1822, election Carr resigned and the recently
                    established 
                        Indianapolis

                        of

                        Washington County
                    , as the new agent. In this same issue one who called himself "Mentor"
                    complained: 
                        We learn, by the Indiana Gazette, that his Excellency Jonathan Jennings has again shown his

                                    then received —400 yearly. The act organizing the agency required the
                                    keeping of certain records by these two officials. Because of this work the
                                    treasurer was allowed one per cent of the revenue of the 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     Fund: the auditor one-half of one per cent. These percentages and the
                                    pay of the agent were payable from the revenue of the

            "Mentor" made specific charges to show how Carr hail neglected the duties of his
                    office, stating that the latter had kept his office at 
                        Salem
                    , 
                        Charlestown
                    , 
                        Vincennes
                     or elsewhere in the lower end of the state. It was claimed that Carr had notified
                    Jennings in April that he intended to resign the office because of the salary reduction, and that
                    local residents had offered their services to the governor, who allegedly flattered all with their
                    prospects until after the August election. Then, safely elected to Congress he had appointed his
                    tool Milroy! "Many People" also expressed resentment of the practice of importing
                    officers from other parts of the state and served notice that redress would be demanded at the next
                    legislative session.32 These protests came before the first installment was due
                    on the original purchases of lots!
            For some time the Gazette kept its readers informed concerning the arrivals and
                    departures of Milroy. He was reported as having arrived in town on October 8, remaining in seclusion
                    at a private house for a few days, and then departing for the south, perhaps because the 
                        Indianapolis
                     climate was too cold for his "delicate constitution." The newspaper
                    told of a sick man who was forced to pay a penalty of "seventy five
                    cents" because his daughter could not find the agent on time, although she had
                    inquired of his whereabouts at every public house in the town.33
            
            Agent Milroy was soon succeeded by Bethuel F. Morris who was the first president of the Indiana
                    Temperance Society, a member of the Indiana University Board of Trustees and the first recording
                    secretary of the Indiana Historical Society.34 In 1823 the Assembly authorized

                     two additional brick yards, of two acres each; the cutting down
                    of timber on unsold lots, but trees were not to be allowed to remain as obstructions in streets or
                    alleys for longer than ten days; and the renting of improved land on the donation.35 In April the two brick yards were sold for a total purchase price of —263 or
                    nearly —65.75 an acre, despite the fact that the most convenient of them was located more
                    than "three fourths of a mile" from the center of the town!36
            
            Two years later, on the same terms as the 1821 auction, fifty-seven additional lots were sold for a
                    total purchase price of nearly —6,800 or approximately —120 each.37 No additional lots appear to have been sold until after the end of the period
                    under consideration. In January of 1826, Governor James B. Ray approved an act for the relief of
                    those who had purchased lots before October 31, 1821, and pursuant to this legislation more than
                    half of such lots were relinquished to the state.38
            
            From 1821 to 1826 inclusive, a total revenue of approximately —22,000 was received at the
                    state treasury from the proceeds of the capital donation. Nearly all of this amount came from the
                    sale of lots and brick yards, although a meagre amount was derived from the collection of rents and
                    perhaps a negligible amount arose from the sale of timber.39 Had there been no 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund, as the revenue of the donation was designated, the state building program would
                    undoubtedly have been much more meagre than it was prior to 1827 for, although the total state
                    expenditures averaged less than —30,000 annually during the first decade of statehood,
                    the state was never free from a somewhat burdensome public debt.40

            In referring to the capital grant Governor Jennings told the 1820–1821 Assembly: 
                        The property thus secured, by timely care and prudent management, will in due time produce
                            ample resources, without resorting to taxation, to meet the expenditures necessary for the
                            erection of all public edifices of state character.41
                  
                    A few years later Governor William Hendricks expressed similar views to another Assembly.42 During this period the revenue of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund was faithfully applied to the purpose for which it was reserved.
            The State Prison, at 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , was the first public building financed from the proceeds of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund. Governor William Henry Harrison had advised the territorial Assembly of the need
                    for a prison and by the early twenties the state prison movement was general.43
                    In January of 1821, only three days after he had approved a law organizing the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Agency, Governor Jennings endorsed an act for the location of the state prison at or
                    near 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . The institution was to be supervised by a board of managers, but the convicts were to
                    be under the more immediate care of a prison agent who, with the consent of the managers, was
                    empowered to contract with the directors of the 
                        Jeffersonville
                        Ohio
                     Canal Company for the employment of able bodied inmates on the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls canal project which was then receiving considerable attention.44 A 
                        Vincennes
                     newspaper assented to this location with the sarcastic suggestion that "a mill
                    should always be erected where it is most needed; in fact any building should be
                        central, eligible, and convenient to the purpose for which it is
                        intended…."45
            
            The prison was financed as a partnership affair between the state and private individuals in which
                    the profits were to be divided in proportion to the amount of stock owned.

                            important factor in causing the prison to be located au 
                                Jeffersonville
                            . On this point see: Laws of the State of Indiana,

                                Gazetteer (

                     The state appropriated the sum of —3,000 as its
                    initial con. tribution, specifying that the profit arising therefrom was to be invested in stock of
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls canal enterprise.46 It is perhaps needless to add that the
                    prison was a financial liability from the very beginning. On October 2, 1821, the governor
                    proclaimed the prison ready for the reception of inmates and about two months later he advised the
                    Assembly that the prison builders were entitled to further legislative consideration.47 Following this the Assembly appropriated an additional —500 to Reuben H.
                    Murray and Robert Gray, the prison contractors.48
            
            About one year later Governor Hendricks told the legislators that another appropriation was necessary
                    for the penitentiary, "not only for its prosperity, but for its existence."49 The lawmakers seem to have agreed for they appropriated the sum of
                    —2,500 for the erection of a prison wall.50 In 1824, provision was
                    made for the digging and walling of prison wells, the erection of workshops and other prison
                        needs.51 At this time the management of the institution was changed and Ira
                    Westover, who later met his death at the Battle of the 
                        Alamo
                    , was appointed superintendent.52
            
            An analysis of the annual reports of the state treasurer reveals that a minimum total of about
                    —10,800 was expended on account of the state prison to the close of the year 1826. Much
                    the greater portion of this total, probably at least four-fifths, was supplied from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund, but some of it was provided from tax revenue since some of the expense was for
                    other than building purposes.53
            
            Several months after the initial appropriation had been made for the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     prison the Assembly set aside

                     County courthouse, which was also to be used as a state captiol.54

                    Gazette staunchly defended it, pointing out that other counties had obtained
                    liberal grants of land or money from individuals to aid in the construction of their courthouses,
                    while 
                        Indianapolis
                     citizens had paid high prices for their lots.55 Another
                    appropriation in 1824 brought the total expenditure on account of the 
                        Marion
                     courthouse to approximately —14,000.56 Charles H. Test,
                    a member of the 1826–1827 Assembly, wrote his wife that this capitol was "much
                    the hand-somest public building in the state."57
            
            An 1824 statute transferred the capital from Corydon to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and specified that the next Assembly, which normally would have met in December of
                    1824, would not convene until the second Monday of January, 1825. This act reserved the use of the 
                        Marion
                     courthouse to the state Assembly for a period of fifty years and also reserved the use
                    of the same to the Indiana Supreme Court and the federal courts.58 Samuel
                    Merrill, then state treasurer, was appointed to superintend the removal and he was authorized to
                    sell all furniture and other items which he believed could not be advantageously Pursuant to this
                    legislation moved.59 Merrill sold goods bringing, all told, —52.52.
                    The transfer of the remaining goods was reported as costing a total of —118.07, or only
                    —65.55 after subtracting the amount received from the proceeds of the Corydon sale.60 For some unknown reason the Assembly allowed Merrill but —60.55
                    for moving the furniture and other state property, but allowed him —100 for his personal
                    trouble and expense in making the midwinter trip from the old to the new capital,61 and "Though the distance was only 125 miles, such was the state of [the] roads

                    to Merrill's official report only two wagons were required to move the property of the
                    state to the wilderness capital.
            By 1825, when 
                        Indianapolis
                     became the permanent capital, the depression clouds were clearing, the price of land
                    was rising, the financial situation of the state treasury was improving, and the flow of immigrants
                    was rapidly increasing.63 Such factors induced agitation for additional public
                    buildings at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Governor Hendricks advised the 1825 Assembly that the buildings to be located on the
                    circl'e and the statehouse square should be commenced as soon as practicable, claiming that
                    the public faith of the state was pledged to such a policy.64 This Assembly
                    appropriated the sum of —1,000 to build "a substantial brick house for the
                    residence of the treasurer… and auditor, and a fireproof vault for the better security of
                    the funds and records of the state…."65 No further
                    appropriation seems to have been made from the

                     Fund until after 1826.
            The appropriations on account of the 
                        Marion
                     County courthouse and the building for the treasurer and auditor totaled nearly
                    —15,000. Salary allowances to the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Agent and percentage allowances to the auditor and treasurer, along with other possible
                    miscellaneous items, raised the total appropriations from the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund, apart from those on behalf of the state prison, to about —18,000. The
                    appropriations from the fund were somewhat greater than the receipts of the same prior to 1827.
                    Perhaps some of the appropriations were not paid until after 1826, while transfers may have been
                    made from other sources to the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Fund.66
            
            When Indiana became a state the site of the future state capital was in the possession of the
                    aborigines. Early in 1827 the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal reviewed the history of the capital village. The Journal
                    reported that Indianapolis then had about one thousand "souls," living in
                    twenty-five

                    Mention was made of the county courthouse, a county jail and of meeting-houses belonging to the
                    Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist societies. Although the Presbyterians had a membership of only
                    about thirty they had a "settled" preacher and the three denominations together
                    supported a Sunday School which had about twenty teachers and from one hundred to two hundred
                    scholars. It was stated that there were weekly schools with teachers who would not have been a
                    discredit to their profession anywhere in the 
                        United States
                    . Similar praise was bestowed upon members of other learned professions. The town was
                    reported as having a favorable climate and moral advantages. It was also pointed out that
                    Indianapolis was located at the crossroads of the 
                        Michigan
                     and National roads. The Journal's account manifested a
                    pardonable spirit of pride concerning the growth of its free and self governing city, which had been
                    transformed from a howling wilderness to the capital of a commonwealth in much less than a
                        decade.67
            
            The members of the first 
                        Indianapolis
                     Assembly, all but one of whom were born outside of Indiana,68
                    realized something of the significance of such achievements, for in inviting the aged General 
                        Lafayette
                     to visit the West they said: 
                        They feel persuaded, that he will take a deep interest in this part of our country, which,
                            though not the actual theatre of his generous labors, has emphatically grown out of the
                            glorious resulis of his revolutionary services. On the west of the Alleghany mountains, our
                            illustrious guest will behold extensive communities of freemen, which within the period of
                            his own recollection, have been substituted for the trackless wilderness. Where, forty years
                            ago, primeval barbarism held undisputed sway over man and nature; civilization, liberty and
                            law, wield the mild sceptre of equal rights; it is here, that our illustrious friend will
                            find his name, his services, and we trust, his principles flourishing in perennial verdure.
                            Here too, may he enjoy the exulting prospect of seeing them, in the language of a favorite
                            son of the West, "transmitted with unabated vigor down the tide of time, to the
                            countless millions of posterity."69

            The Northwest Indians and the British Preceding the War of 1812.1
            
            CECIL K. BYRD
            
            Public officials of the Indiana, 
                        Michigan
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                     territories, private individuals, and the press, believed in the decade before 1812
                    that the British in 
                        Canada
                     were encouraging the Indians of the Northwest to resist land sales to the 
                        United States
                     government. They thought, too, that the Indian depredations and warlike activities
                    prior to the War were supported and fomented by the British Indian department, or by other British
                    agents from Malden, Upper 
                        Canada
                    . A comparison of the accusations that were made against the British with the official
                    British Indian policy as it affected the Indians in the territories of the 
                        United States
                     in the decade prior to the War of 1812 will afford a test of the validity of the
                    accusations.
            When Westerners arraigned the British as the instigators of their frontier difficulties with the
                    Indians, using precedent as their guide, they were not altogether on unhistorical ground. During the
                    period when 
                        England
                     still retained the Western posts, English officers gave material assistance and direct
                    encouragement to the Indians in their wars against the 
                        United States
                    .2
            
            Shortly after the Indiana Territory was created reports were sent out that the British were tampering
                    with the Indians. Reports of such nature continued to emanate not only from Indiana but from 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     territories as late as the close of the War of 1812. They varied only in their
                    intensity and directness. As early as July, 1801, William Henry Harrison, governor of Indiana
                    Territory, wrote Henry Dearborn, Secretary of War, that "the British have. been unremitting
                    in their exertions to preserve their influence over the Indians resident within our
                    territory…. " He feared conversations by the British among the Indians would
                    weaken the little influence he had over them, and stated that his informants reported that the
                    British were especially assiduous

                    interest, as a means of assisting them in any designs they may form against 
                        Louisiana
                    …."3
            
            When the Indians complained to Harrison early in 1802 about the treatment they were receiving from
                    the Americans, saying that the Americans used them for their own selfish aggrandizement, Harrison
                    could explain the complaints in no other manner than that such ideas had been suggested to the
                    Indians by Britishers. He believed the Indian jeremiads to be above the capacity of the Indians, and
                    said "they must have been put into his mouth [the Indian's] by the said
                        M'Kee,4 or by some of the British merchants." The Indians
                    lamented that the 
                        United States
                     was seeking to destroy them and to take possession of their land. Harrison stated that
                    the British had been the instigators of this report, and that, they had "even attempted to
                    make the Indians believe that the 
                        United States
                     intended to destroy them by means of the small-pox…." transmitted
                    by goods received from government agents.5
            
            William Hull, governor of the 
                        Michigan
                     Territory, reported to 
                        Dearborn
                     in October, 1805, that there was considerable activity among the Indians; that the
                    Western Indians on the 
                        Mississippi
                     had been sending messengers to the Chippeways, Ottawas, Potawatomies, and Shawnee
                    telling them that the people of the 
                        United States
                     meant to exterminate them. The Western Indians advocated a common war. Hull could not
                    place blame for the stir among the Indians on the British government or on any of the officers high
                    in command, but he did believe "there are many individuals, who have great influence with
                    the Indians, [who] would give encouragement to it."6 Probably the
                    "many individuals" to whom Hull referred were the numerous British traders who,

                    British traders to spur them to action cannot be underestimated.7
            
            By the summer of 1807 there was an acute state of nervosity among the settlers and public men of the
                    Indiana and 
                        Michigan
                     territories, due to the activities of Tecumseh and the Prophet. In 1806 these two
                    Indians had gathered the remnants of the Shawnee tribe about them at Greenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , where the religious fanaticism and eloquence of the Prophet, combined with the
                    practicability and statesmanship of Tecumseh, caused Indians from many tribes to flock around
                        them.8 Their influence was felt not only in the immediate neighborhood of
                    Greenville, but especially in the region of the Great Lakes. "All the Ottawas from
                    L'arbe au Croche adhere strickly [sic] to the Shawney Prophets
                        advice…."9 Dawson states that the Indians "were
                    assembling in ceuncil day and night, and belts of wampum, and pipes, were sent in all
                    directions…. An extensive correspondence

                                frequently employed in stirring up the Indians against the

                                their avengers against the property and persons of their rivals.

                    M'Kee…. "10 The ebullition and movements of the
                    Indians were thought to be caused by their attempt to form a union or confederacy among themselves.
                    Such a union, it was feared, would be hostile to the 
                        United States
                     because it was believed that the British were the real promoters of the movement. At
                    this time the Shawnee tribe and part of the Potawatomies, Chippeways, and Ottawas were friendly to
                    the British.11
            
            Captain I. Dunham, Commander at Michilimackinac, was convinced that the intentions of the Prophet and
                    Tecumseh were hostile to the 
                        United States
                     and that they were meditating "to Strike somewhere, a desperate and decisive
                        blow."12 Governor Hull did not know by whose influence they were
                    moved, possibly by their own.13 But he did report increased activity of the
                    British Indian agents at St. Josephs, where "all the Northern Indians are to be
                        collected…."14 He likewise noted that "Large
                    bodies of Indians from the westward and southward continue to visit the British post at
                    Amherstburgh, and are supplied with provisions, arms, am munition…. " and that
                    "Much more attention is paid to them than usual."15 In October
                    he reported that there were about two thousand Indians at Amherstburg, nine-tenths of whom resided
                    in the 
                        United States
                    . "The British," he stated, "seem to be making every
                    preparation for War, and It is the general opinion, with them, that it will take place."16 Indian chiefs on their way home from Malden were examined by Hull. From them
                    he was informed that the British talked of a near war with the 
                        United States
                     and told the Indians they "must take up the hatchet in their
                        favor."17
            
            Hull sent speeches to the Indians of the Territory and environs in an effort to counteract the
                    British influence. His efforts, however, were of little effect, for he reported that the Indians

                    the Frontier," he reported, "is such that I have thought it my duty to fortify
                    this Town in the strongest manner possible agst Indians."18
            
            To the citizens of the Territory of 
                        Michigan
                     the journeys of the Indians to Amherstburg, the passing of the war-pipe and the
                    execution of war dances was proof enough of an offensive alliance between the Indians and the
                    British. By public resolution they unanimously resolved "That any attack from the Indians
                    upon our settlements, shall be considered as actuated by the British Government and that We shall
                    act accordingly."19
            
            The gathering of Indians at Greenville aroused great apprehension among the settlers of the Indiana
                    Territory. William Wells, Indian agent, informed Harrison that the Prophet kept a communication with
                    the British at Malden. Moreover, he was telling the Indians that the Great Spirit was going to
                    destroy every white man in America, and as a result the Indians were preparing for war. "It
                    is my opinion," he stated, "that the British are at the bottom of all this
                    Business and depend on it that if we have war with them that many of the Indian tribes will take an
                    active part against us…."20
            
            Harrison believed the cause of the "stir and commotion" was the attempt of the
                    Indians to "cement a more perfect union and friendship amongst themselves….
                    " but he felt the real spirit behind the movement was British influence. The confederacy
                    was part of a general coalition against thc 
                        United States
                    .21 In a pungent letter to the secretary of war he gave vent to his
                    spleen: 
                        The British could not have adopted a better plan to effect their purpose of alienating from
                            our government the affections of the Indians than employing this vile Instrument (the
                            Prophet). It manifests at once their inveterate ranmur against us and their perfect
                            acquaintance with the Indian character.22

                     part of the Potawatomies only waited for a sign from the British
                    agents to commence an attack on the settlements.23 The plan of confederation had
                    not yet been communicated to the Miamis, Weas, Delawares, and the Kickapoos.24
                    Word was sent by the governor to the Shawnee to scatter the warriors gathered around the Prophet,
                    but the governor's command went unheeded.

                    Western Sun, with "Truth its Guide-Liberty its Object," was loud
                    in its denunciation of British intrigue in 1807. An article signed "Veritas"
                    answering an earlier one by "An Elector," accused the latter of being pro-British
                    in sympathy and went on to denounce 
                        England
                     "which even now has her agents stirring up the numerous tribes of Indians to
                    make war."25 "Shandy," one of Editor Stout's
                    many anonymous correspondents, "From information recently received," could state,
                    "there is every reason to believe that the Indians in the neighborhood of 
                        Canada
                    , entertain the most hostile designs against us." British agents, he continued,
                    especially McKee and Elliott,26 were working among the Indians within the
                    borders of the Indiana Territory. Further, the Prophet was called a tool of the British and, it was
                    asserted, British agents "are sulking amongst us."27 As was
                    the editorial custom in those days, Editor Stout worked as vigorously with the scissors as with the
                    pencil. From the National Intelligencer came a clipping that informed the readers
                    of the Western Sun why the Indians considered the Americans as objects of hatred:
                        
                        It is impossible to view such extravagance as flowing from the unprejudiced mind of the
                            savage. It can only be ascribed to the interested views of a foreign trading company, or to
                            the instructions or countenance of the government from which that company emanates.23

                     may fairly be imputed to the machinations and influence of
                    British agents and traders."29
            
            Because the possibility of war with 
                        England
                     seemed less likely in 1808 than in 1807, there was comparative quiet, on the frontiers
                    during the later year. Harrison did make a significant observation in his report to the secretary of
                    war in April, 1808, when he stated that one constant source of friction between the Indians and the
                    settlers was the presence among the former of British traders and agents. These men constantly
                    counteracted the influence of the Americans among the Indians and would do so until a law
                    prohibiting their residence among Indians was passed.30 From 
                        Detroit
                     in July of that year J. R. Williams, a 
                        Detroit
                     trader, wrote a letter that was so typical of the belief held by Westerners that it
                    will bear quoting. In part, went the epistle:

            In 1809 the initial success enjoyed by the Prophet seemed to be on the wane. Wells apprised Harrison
                    that the Indians were leaving him, especially the Chippeways, Ottawas, and the Potawatomies. The
                    loss of prestige was in part caused by the Prophet's strong advocation of the extermination
                    of the whites of the Indiana Territory.32
            
            Harrison, in spite of the enthusiastic report from Wells,

                     was none too credulous about the Prophet's loss of
                    influence. Nor did he give credence to the reports that the Chippeways and Ottawas were so at odds
                    with the Prophet that they were going to wage war against his followers. Such reports he thought to
                    be strategies suggested by the British. The Chippeways and Ottawas were on their way to join the
                    Prophet on the 
                        Wabash
                    ; together they would then fall upon the settlements.33
            
            Could Harrison have read a report sent in that same year by William Clark, governor of the 
                        Louisiana
                     Territory, he would have been even more pessimistic. Clark wrote from 
                        St. Louis
                     that he was convinced that the British were interfering with the Indians of the
                    Northwest. He had evidence to prove that four British subjects had wintered at Rivière
                    à la Roche [Rock River] in disguise. While there they had tried to get the Indian nations
                    together and send them against the American frontiers.34
            
            For the years 1808, 1809, and 1810, there were in the Western Sun numerous articles and letters
                    stigmatizing the Prophet as a British pawn, and branding the British with reproach for their
                    intrepidity in encouraging the Indians to resist land sales.35 The confederacy
                    that had been under way among the Indians gave the editor considerable worry because it
                    "was the effect of British intrigue—and we have never doubted that the secret
                    agents of that power, which are known to exist in every part of America but particularly in the
                    Indian country, gave it all the countenance in their power."36
            
            In April, 1810, Harrison wrote to the secretary of war in a great state of agitation. He had
                    "lately received information from sources which leave no room to doubt its correctness,
                    that the Shawnee Prophet is again exciting the Indians to Hostilities against the 
                        United States
                    ." The Prophet had an estimated one thousand Indians under his command, of
                    which 350 or 400 were warriors. They consisted of Kickapoos, Winnebagos, Potawatomies, Shawnee,
                    Chippeways, and Ottawas. Again Harrison was certain "that the

                     present hostile disposition of the Prophet and his Votaries has
                    been produced by British interference." The Indians had received a large supply of
                    ammunition from Malden, refusing to buy any from the American traders because "they could
                    get more without paying for it…. " Though the British were behind the activities
                    of the Prophet, Harrison did not entirely despair of peace. He thought 
                        it probable that the British agents in 
                                Canada
                             have anticipated the orders of their government in their endeavors to set the
                            Indians upon us, and that the first account of a favorable change of disposition towards
                            America in that Government will induce them to countermand the orders, which have been given
                            to their Indian allies.37
                  
                    
            
            In spite of the many reports brought in by scouts and friendly Indians of the Prophet's
                    intentions of going to war, Harrison in May could still report that there would be no Indian war
                    unless 
                        England
                     and the 
                        United States
                     went to war. He was, however, concerned about the possibility of the Indian
                    disaffection extending to the tribes of the 
                        Illinois
                     River. That would double the number of the Prophet's warriors and enable them
                    to do great damage to frontier settlements.38
            
            One month later the dispatches of the governor took on a new note. He believed that the British might
                    urge the Indians to hostilities even though they had no intention of going to war themselves. That
                    "corrupt Government" might do it just "for the purpose of increasing our
                    difficulties and embarrassments…."39 The Indians were ripe
                    for war, many were only restrained by fear. Proper and timely urging would send them down on the
                    settlements. Harrison did not want to create undue alarm, but he considered events of such a
                    threatening nature that defensive measures should be taken. Accordingly, after consulting the public
                    officers and some important merchants of 
                        Vincennes
                    , he called two companies of the militia into actual service and established alarm
                        posts.40
            
            Shortly after the defensive measures had been taken one of Harrison's informants reported
                    that the Prophet's

                     plan of confederation included all the tribes on the 
                        Mississippi
                     and also the Southern tribes, especially the Creeks (the Prophet's mother
                    supposedly was a Creek), and the Choctaws. The Prophet was urging confederation by telling the
                    Indians that unless they unified and made a stand against the whites they would lose their land. 
                        Detroit
                    , 
                        Chicago
                    , Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , 
                        Vincennes
                    , and 
                        St. Louis
                     were to be destroyed. Again Harrison accused the British of being the authors of the
                    plan. Having given the impulse to the movement, the British now "found it difficult to
                    regulate the after movements of their tawny allies."41
            
            Governor Clark, in July, complained that the Sacs and the Kickapoos were visiting both Malden and 
                        St. Joseph
                     and that a great number of them were then visiting the Prophet.42
                    Harrison in the same month reported that Matthew Elliott was scattering presents with a lavish hand
                    among the In diana.43 He estimated the value of the presents to exceed the value
                    of all the peltries taken from the country inhabited by the tribes. The presents were not given for
                    commercial reasons, "But from a desire to retain in their influence the most warlike of the
                    Tribes, as a kind of barrier to 
                        Canada
                    ."44 John Johnston, 
                        United States
                     Factor at Fort 
                        Wayne
                    , reported that the Sauks had just returned from a visit to the British. The party had
                    received "forty-seven rifles and a number of fusils, with plenty of powder and
                        lead."45
            
            The inhabitants both of the Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     territories were greatly disturbed over the activities of the Indians in 1810. The
                    people between the Big and Little 
                        Wabash
                     rivers, inhabiting the prairies, were "very much fluctuated [sic] of late concerning a talk of an Indian War…." Out of forty-two
                    families in that region only fifteen were determined to stay and those that stayed had erected a
                    fort for protection.46 The citizens of Indiana Territory sent the following
                    petition to 
                        Madison
                    :

                        It is a matter of regret that even we so far in the interiour cannot be shielded from the
                            effects of the more than savage policy of Britain—in constantly keeping
                            commissaries for the corruption of our aboriginal neighbours—and it is still more
                            lamentable that strong grounds of presumption exist that there are those resident amongst us
                            engaged in the nefarious design.47
                  
                    
            
            In December Harrison reported that the chiefs in a council at Brownstown had entered into a
                    resolution to make no more land sales. The "British Agent [Matthew] Elliott strongly
                    recommended this measure to them, and informed them that the English and French had made peace and
                    would soon unite their arms to dispossess the Americans of tho lands they had taken from the
                        Indians."48
            
            The year 1811 brought with it more reports of "hostile Indians urged on by the
                    British" and the long-expected Indian war culminated in the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    . But before that battle many were the denunciations of British perfidy. Harrison told
                    the secretary of war that if the intentions of the British were "pacifick the Indian
                    department of Upper 
                        Canada
                     have not been made acquainted with them…."49
                    Johnston derived the same information he had "been in possession of for several years, to
                    wit: the intrigues of the British agents… in creating an influence hostile to our
                    people…." and urged the establishment of a fort near the Prophet's town
                    on the 
                        Wabash
                    .50 Matthew Irwin, 
                        United States
                     Factor at 
                        Chicago
                    , wrote that Indians were assembling on a branch of the 
                        Illinois
                     under the influence of the Prophet.51 This
                    "banditti," wrote Harrison, "is now about to be let loose upon us,
                    and… nothing but vigorous measures will prevent it."52 The
                    Indians were destroying the property of people who lived on the frontiers and insulting the families
                    left unprotected. A Potawatomie War Chief told Harrison that a British agent had delivered a message
                    to the Prophet telling him the time had come to take up arms.53 Benjamin Parke,
                    Captain of the Light Dragoons, asked to make a report by Harrison, confirmed rumors that the

                     Prophet's party was greatly increasing. More alarming,
                    he found the disaffection to extend to all of the tribes between the 
                        Wabash
                    , 
                        Mississippi
                    , and Great Lakes. The "language and measures of the Indians indicate nothing
                    but War…. " To dissolve the confederacy and "silence the turbulent and
                    unprincipled," a force of several thousand men ought to be marched into the country.54
            
            Another of Harrison's informants, Touissant Dubois, Indian trader, reported that all of the
                    Indians of the 
                        Wabash
                     had been or were on a visit to Malden. The British were distributing goods with
                    abandon. Dubois examined the goods of an Indian (not a chief) and "found that he had
                    received an elegant rifle, 25 pounds of powder 50 of lead 3 blankets 3 strouds of cloth, ten shirts
                    and several other articles."55 The amount of goods sent over for that
                    year exceeded by twenty thousand pounds sterling the goods for ordinary years.56
            
            The Western Sun informed its readers that so great was the fear of the Indians in
                    the 
                        Illinois
                     Territory that citizens there were moving into forts, and Editor Stout feared that
                    "there is little room to hope that a rupture with the Indians can be avoided."57 In August, 1811, a gathering of citizens of 
                        Knox
                     County, Indiana Territory, "Resolved that we are fully convinced that the
                    formation of the combination headed by the Shawanoe Prophet, is a British scheme, and that agents of
                    that power are constantly exciting the Indians to hostility against the 
                        United States
                    ."58 The resolution with a letter was directed to the
                    President asking that vigorous measures be taken. When Tecumseh made a visit to 
                        Vincennes
                     late in July, 1811, and in the course of his speech to Harrison denied affiliation with
                    the British, Editor Stout paraphrased his remarks to read, "In obedience to the orders of
                    my masters (the British), I have now succeeded in uniting the northern tribes of Indians in a
                    confederacy for the purpose of attacking the 
                        United States
                    ."59
            
            We have seen, then, that Westerners were open in denouncing the British of 
                        Canada
                     as the fount of their Indian

                     troubles. Attacks such as those above described did not cease
                    with the Battle of 
                        Tippecanoe
                    , but grew in violence and frequency and continued down to the declaration of war in
                    June, 1812. In fact, these reports as they emanated froiu Indiana, 
                        Michigan
                    , and 
                        Illinois
                     territories were taken up by the presses of 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , and 
                        Tennessee
                     and were of primary importance in shaping Western opinion and building up a war
                        psychosis.60 These reports were reiterated in the halls of Congress by the
                    "War Hawks" or the "Liberty Boys': from the frontier regions and
                    they gave as one of the reasons for desiring a declaration of war the fact that the British were
                    urging the Indians to hostilities against the American frontiers.61
            
            When Westerners accused the English of plotting with the Indians and urging them to war against the
                    Americans and to resist further land sales, they thought they had a genuine grievance. By studying
                    the correspondence and papers of British officials we can gain some insight into the nature of the
                    official British Indian policy. It is well to remember, however, that official British Indian policy
                    is one thing, whereas unofficial Indian policy might bear no relation to it. The home government
                    might pursue one policy while the many British traders who circulated among the tribes, and who
                    wielded no mean influence over them, might, to protect their economic interests, be conducting
                    programs antipodal with those of the British government. The official policy shall be described
                    here; the Indian relations of British traders will be dealt with in the future.
            That the British cultivated the friendship of the Indians in the Northwest from the close of the
                    American Revolution to the cession of the Western posts, and that they encouraged the Indians to
                    make war against the moving line of American settlers has been shown by Andrew C. McLaughlin.62 We are here concerned with the British attitude toward the Indians in 
                        United States
                     territory after 1796. What was

                     the policy of the Canadian Indian department toward Indians
                    resident in 
                        United States
                     territories?
            For some twelve years following the cession of the Western posts by 
                        England
                     the Indian department of Upper 
                        Canada
                     pursued an extremely passive policy toward the Indians of the Northwest. They, of
                    course, continued the practice of giving them a few annual presents, for to do otherwise would have
                    meant the loss or curtailment of their trade among the various tribes. But the expenditures of the
                    department had been cut, for, "Retaining their attachment to the King's Interests
                    has not of late years been thought an object worthy of consideration…."63 If the British were actively urging the Indians to war on the Americans, such
                    persuasions must have been indeed secretive, for the Canadian archives contain no evidence of such
                    incriminating character.64 In fact, on several occasions when Indians poured out
                    their grievances against the Americans to the British Indian agents and talked of going to war, the
                    agents recommended peace.65
            
            Beginning in 1807, when war between the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        England
                     seemed likely, the English again started taking an active interest in the Indians. The
                    purpose of this renewed interest in them is revealed in a letter written by Sir James H. Craig, the
                    governor-general of 
                        Canada
                    , to Francis Gore, lieutenant-governor. Craig was concerned about the position of the
                    Indians in event of an Anglo-American war, for he knew "If a war takes place, they will not
                    be idle. If we do not employ them, there cannot exist a moment's doubt that they will be
                    employed against us…. " He feared that unless the Indians were brought over to
                    the British side, the chain of friendship would be broken and "All our valuable commerce
                    now carried on in the Indian country would be lost and it would be years before our traders could
                    venture to the parts necessary to resume it." He urged that much caution be used in
                    conversations with the Indians and even suggested that negotiations should wait until war became

                     65 At an Indian council held at Amherstburg in June, 1805, the Indians
                            pledged to take up the hatchet any time for the British, but McKee strongly urged that peace
                            be maintained between Indians and the people of the 
                                United States
                            .

                     more likely. If, however, the Americans made direct. proposals
                    to the Indians, the British Indian agents were to lose no time in sending messages to the different
                    Indian nations and putting the question of aid to them point-blank. But if the Indians were to be
                    used, "They should never be suffered to act alone if it can be avoided, but always with
                    some of our people…. " Craig had heard something of the Prophet and suggested to
                    Gore that the British purchase his aid in case of war.66
            
            The same sentiment Craig expressed to Castlereagh. He explained that the Indians were valueless as
                    friends, but dangerous as enemies. He, therefore, thought it politic to attempt to secure them to
                    the interests of Great Britain. For some time the Indian department had been under the jurisdiction
                    of the civil authorities. Craig suggested that better results could be obtained if it could be again
                    placed under military command.67
            
            Castlereagh was quick to agree with Craig upon his proposed Indian policy: "Under an
                    undefined relation with the 
                        United States
                     of America, I entirely concur in your Position, that attention must be kept up to
                    conciliate the Indian Tribes upon the following Principle; that if in a contest they are not
                    employed to act with us, they will be engaged to act against us…." Furthermore,
                    he let it be known that if the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        England
                     ironed out their difficulties he would be willing to enter into some joint system for
                    the treatment of the Indians as the basis of a permanent arrangement.68
            
            As a guarantee that the Indians would ally with them in case of a future war, the British took steps
                    to cement the alliance. Members of the Indian department felt that the task of winning over the
                    Indians after such a long period of neglect was a difficult one. Steps were taken for the conduction
                    of a pressure campaign on the Indians. Everything that would aid in such a campaign was used by the
                    department, even to bringing a surgeon to Amherstburg to minister to the ailing Indians as they came
                        in.69 Craig ordered Gore

                    advance of the land-hungry Americans. He stated that the officers "of the Indian Department
                    must be diligent and active, the communication must be constant…. " The idea
                    that the English were the only source of protection for them "must be held up to them not
                    merely in Great Councils and public Assemblies, they should be privately urged to some of their
                    leading men, with whom endeavors should be used to lead them to a confidence in us…

            Gore realized the great effort that would have to be put forth by the Indian department completely to
                    win back the Indians. As a step in his plan of conciliation he made Amherstburg the residence of the
                    Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, because that was the principal gathering place of
                    the Western Indians,71 and readmitted into the Indian department Matthew Elliott
                    who had much influence over the savages. From Amherstburg messages were sent to the Indians in all
                    parts of the Northwest inviting them to come there for councils.72 While
                    assembled they were given presents of many kinds including guns, gunpowder and lead. Elliott
                    reported to William Claus, deputy superintendent of Indian affairs for Upper 
                        Canada
                    , that by November, 1810, he had already given 6,000 Indians their annual presents and
                    had issued 70,770 rations.73 In councils the British spoke to the Indians of the
                    differences that existed between the two governments and told the Indians that they could regain the
                    country taken from them by the Americans.74

                  74 At a conference in Amherstburg in 1808, Claus using James Girty as his
                        interpreter told Captain Johnny, Blackwood, and Buffaloe, three principal Shawnee chiefs that
                        "You must be sensible & must see and feel the conduct of the Americans towards
                        you when compared with that of your Great Father the King, whose affection for his Indian
                        Children is as warm as it ever was & you cannot think otherwise, for altho' far
                        removed from you, yet he every year thinks of their necessities & sends to this country
                        for their use cloathing, and a great variety of other necessary articles, besides arms &
                        ammunition for the young men—All that you have ever received from the American
                        Government has been as a payment for Land wrested from you by unfair means."

            The members of the Indian department were skeptical about the success of their campaign to win the
                    Indians. Gore especially was pessimistic. In a letter to Craig he attempted to correct the optimism
                    of Elliott, by stating that the only way the co-operation of the Indians could be relied upon was by
                    sending a great regular force to Upper 
                        Canada
                    . When the Indians were reassured by the presence of such a force, they might
                        co-operate.75 Major General Isaac Brock thought the British would first have
                    to capture De troit and Michilimackinac before the Indians would join forces with them.76
            
            When Westerners in the press and by dispatch accuse? the Prophet and Tecumseh of holding constant
                    intercourse with the British at Amherstburg they were not far from correct. Shortly after the
                    Prophet moved to the 
                        Wabash
                     in 1808, he sent a message to Claus assuring him of his friendship.77 In June of that year Tecumseh was at Amherstburg and Claus reported that he held a
                    three-hour conversation with him,78 but the purport of the conversation was not
                    given. Two years later Tecumseh again visited Amherstburg and assured the British of his friendship,
                    and told them he was going to war against the Americans: 
                        Your Fathers have nourished us and raised us up from Childhood, we are now men, and think
                            ourselves capable of defending our Country, in which cause you have given us active
                            assistance and always advice. We are now determined to defend it ourselves, and after
                            raising you on your feet leave you behind but expecting you will push forward towards us
                            what may be necessary to supply our wants.79
                  
                    
            
            While attempting to assure themselves of the aid of the Indians, the British keenly realized that
                    their Indian activities would arouse criticism in the 
                        United States
                    . Craig wrote to Gore in 1808 advising him to conduct Indian affairs with extreme
                    circumspection. Though he wanted to preserve the attachment of the Indians he did not want to do
                    anything that would irritate the public mind in the 
                        United States
                    .80 In talks with the Indians there was, if possible,

                     to be no mention made of possible hostilities. This procedure
                    was to be adopted to prevent the Indians from reporting that the British were trying to force them
                    into a war with the 
                        United States
                    .81 "I beg leave to assure you," went the reply to
                    one of Craig's letters, "that I have been particularly careful in guarding the
                    officers of the Indian department from taking any measures at present, that might tend to initiate
                        [sic] the government of the 
                        United States
                    ."82
            
            When Tecumseh told the British that he was going to war they tried to stop him. Craig advised the
                    members of the Indian department to "use all their influence to dissuade the Indians from
                    their projected plan of hostility, givinq them clearly to understand, that they must not expect any
                    assistance from us."83 Brock did all he could to hold the hand of the
                    Indians from war: 
                        My first care upon my arrival in this Province [York, Upper 
                                Canada
                            ] was to direct the officers of the Indian Department to exert theit. whole
                            influence with the Indians to prevent the attack which I understood a few Tribes meditated
                            agst the American frontier. But their efforts proved fruitless, such was their infatuation
                            the Indians refused to listen to advice and they are now so deeply engaged that I despair of
                            being able to withdraw them from the contest in time to avert their destruction, a high
                            degree of fanaticism which has been for years working in their minds has led to the present
                            state of things.84
                  
                    Gore advised Claus to withhold the supply of arms and ammunition from those tribes that
                    insisted upon going to war, but prudently to compensate the Indians with non-military supplies. He
                    wanted the Indian department so conducted "that His Majesty's Government as far as
                    may be, should preserve its faith with the 
                        United States
                     of America, and its relations with the Indian Nations unimpaired, by the most liberal
                    construction of neutrality towards the former, and benevolence to the latter."85 In urging the Indians to peace, "The officers however should be
                    extremely cautious in pointing out to them, that it is for their own good only, that this advice is
                    given to them, and not from any dirilection [sic] of that regard, with which we
                    always view their interests."86

                        Tippecanoe
                    , the British government working through Augustus J. Foster, British minister, at 
                        Washington
                    , did all it could to repel the attacks made by the American press and Congress on 
                        England
                     as the instigator of the warfare.87 Sir George Prevost,
                    governor-general, had published in many 
                        United States
                     newspapers, especially the Federalist press, an article signed
                    "Philalethes" which attempted to refute accusations made against the British. The
                    following which was written to the editor of the Quebec Mercury gives us some idea
                    of Philalethes: 
                        I have been led to these remarks, Sir, by observing that the opprobrious system of national
                            slander, this new species of warfare, against which neither virtue, nor valour can always
                            furnish an adequate defence [sic] has been transplanted with other noxious
                            productions from the polluted soil of 
                                France
                             to the political Hotbeds of the United. States, where they have for some time
                            been shooting and spreading with a sort of forced and unnatural exuberance.
                        That the British Government in North America has instigated the Indians to make war upon the 
                                United States
                             and has actually furnished arms for that purpose has not only been frequently
                            advanced in the public prints, but has been more than insinuated in official papers and
                            roundly asserted in the speeches of their legislators.
                        If I had access to these vehement Declaimers, I would beg leave to say to them, Where,
                            gentlemen, are we to look for the source of this unmeasured enmity to 
                                England
                            ? Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard hearts? If you really wish
                            to go to war with us is it manly previously to vent your hostility in endeavoring to traduce
                            our character? Do you not see that the unmerited reproach, that you would cast upon us, will
                            recoil, with double force, upon yourselves? Is it politic, if you are bent upon fighting us
                            to irritate a future enemy by unworthy artifices and fabricated charges, which must put his
                            feelings to the rack? To labour to provoke a great and powerful people to forego their
                            natural moderation and to rise into more than ordinary resentment by injurious and insulting
                            invective? By accusation heaped upon accusation without consistency, without probability,
                            without even the shadow of proof?88

                     they furnished the Indians with weapons of war,89 and promised that they could regain land given up to Americans by joining with them in war.
                    When they found that the Indians were going to make war they attempted to dissuade them. Such
                    attempts must have been paradoxical to the savage mind. For on the one hand they were given
                    armaments to wage war, and on other occasions they were told not to commence hostilities. Americans,
                    therefore, were accurate when they reported that the Indians were receiving arms from the British,
                    and that the British were encouraging the Indians to resist land sales. But when they reported that
                    the British were urging the Indians to hostilities they were incorrect.

                         sent in two requisitions for annual Indian presents. One was for peace time, the
                        other was to be used in case of war. The war requisition for 1809 contained orders for 1700
                        firearms, 18,000 pounds of powder, 300 pistols, 20,000 pounds of tobacco, and myriad other
                        items.

            Indiana's Population, 1850–1940, Sources and Dispersal
            STEPHEN S. VISHER
            
            The study in this Magazine
               1 of the source (place of birth) by
                    state or foreign country of the non-Hoosier population of each Indiana county as shown by the Census
                    of 1870 aroused considerable interest and helped to initiate the making of several supplementary
                    corresponding maps. The first four maps which accompany the present article show conspicuously the
                    source by states of Indiana's American born, non-Hoosier population in 1850, 1880, 1910,
                    and 1930. These maps apply to the population of the state as a whole, not to that of specific
                    counties.
            Figure 1 shows that according to the census of 1850,2 Indiana contained many
                    natives of states to the eastward, and also of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        North Carolina
                    , and 
                        Virginia
                    . 
                        Ohio
                     supplied the most people to Indiana, 120,000, or more than one-eighth of
                    Indiana's population. About one-fourth of the state's population was born in 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        Virginia
                    , 
                        North Carolina
                    , and 
                        New York
                    . One-half of the state's population was born in Indiana and the remainder in
                    many other states or in foreign countries. Each of the other Eastern states contributed to
                    Indiana's 1850 population.
            Figure 2 shows that at the 1880 census, 
                        Ohio
                     stood higher among the states than in 1850, with 186,000 natives living in Indiana. But
                    Indiana's population had approximately doubled since 1850, and 
                        Ohio
                    's contribution had declined from one-eighth to one-ninth, approximately. The
                    contributions of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and 
                        New York
                     in 1880 were approximately as great absolutely as in 1850, which meant that they also
                    constituted about half as large a share of the state's population. The emigration from 
                        Virginia
                     and 
                        North Carolina
                     declined considerably. On the other hand, natives of 
                        Illinois
                     were more numerous in Indiana in 1880 than were the natives of 
                        Virginia
                    . Moreover, natives of 
                        Michigan
                     had become more numerous than those of 
                        Maryland
                    . All of the states were represented in Indiana in 1880.

            At the 1910 census3 (Figure 3), 
                        Ohio
                     still led, contributing more than in 1850, but as Indiana's population had
                    increased to 2,700,000, the 
                        Ohio
                     contingent represented sonic six per cent of Indiana's population instead of
                    one-eighth as in 1850. There were, likewise, more natives of 
                        Kentucky
                     in Indiana in 1910 than there were in 1850 or in 1880, while natives of 
                        Ohio
                     were fewer than in 1880. 
                        Illinois
                    , however, had in 1910, as many of its sons and daughters in Indiana as 
                        Kentucky
                    , while 
                        Michigan
                     had two-thirds as many as 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and more than 
                        New York
                    . The contribution of the South showed no substantial increase, but 
                        Missouri
                    , 
                        Iowa
                    , 
                        Kansas
                    , and 
                        Nebraska
                     showed large gains. The latter two of these gains reflected the exodus from those
                    states following dry years there.
            Figure 4 shows that by 1930, 
                        Ohio
                     had been surpassed by 
                        Illinois
                     and especially by 
                        Kentucky
                     as the birth-state of people living in Indiana; 
                        Tennessee
                     supplanted 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and equalled 
                        Michigan
                    ; and 
                        Missouri
                     supplanted 
                        New York
                    .4
            
            Figures 5, 6, and 7 show conspicuously the sources of Indiana's foreign-born population in
                    1850, 1890, and 1930.5 The very high but decreasing rank of 
                        Germany
                    , and the comparative numerical importance of natives of other countries is shown
                    clearly by this series. The spheres in this series represent fewer people than do spheres of
                    corresponding sizes on Figures 1–4 and 11–14. There were about 25,000 Germans
                    in Indiana in 1850, about 85,000 in 1890, 60,000 in 1910, and about 25,000 in 1930. 
                        Ireland
                     was second, with about 15,000 in 1850 and 20,000 in 1890; 
                        Poland
                     was second in 1930 with about 20,000. In 1930 there were in Indiana about 5,000 natives
                    each of 
                        Ireland
                    , 
                        Scotland
                    , 
                        England
                    , Sweden, and 
                        Czechoslovakia
                    . There were 3,000 or 4,000 from each of nine other European countries.
            The following series of maps (Figures 8–11) make conspicuous the numerical contribution
                    which Indiana has made to the populations of other states. In 1850 (Figure 8) about 30,000 native
                    Hoosiers were living in 
                        Illinois
                    , about 20,000

                        Iowa

                        Missouri
                    , 
                        Ohio

                        Kentucky

                        California
                     presumably were part of the Gold Rush of the previous year. By 1880 (Figure 9). the
                    number of Hoosiers living in other states almost equalled the number of natives of other states who
                    lived in Indiana.6 Hoosiers were present in every state but the largest numbers
                    were immediately to the west. 
                        Illinois
                     had nearly 100,000; and 
                        Kansas
                    , 
                        Iowa
                    , and 
                        Missouri
                     each had from 50,000 to 75,000. Likewise, 
                  Ohio, Michigan
               , and 
                        Kentucky
                     each had about 15,000 to 27,000, and 
                        California
                    , 
                        Oregon
                    , 
                        Texas
                    , 
                        Arkansas
                    , and 
                        Minnesota
                     each from 5,000 to 10,000. Relatively little eastward migration was evident, except to 
                        Ohio
                    .
            At the 1910 census (Figure lo), a few less than 150,000 natives of Indiana were living in 
                        Illinois
                    , while about half as many were living in each of the states of 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Kansas
                    . and 
                        Missouri
                    , and less than a third as many, in each of the states of 
                        Michigan
                    , 
                        Oklahoma
                    , 
                        Iowa
                    , and 
                        California
                    .7
            
            At the 1930 census (Figure ll), although the states which contained many Hoosiers in 1910 continued
                    to rank high, five to the east of Indiana's longitude (
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Michigan
                    , 
                        Florida
                    , 
                        New York
                    , and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    ) had gained relatively. The West, except 
                        California
                    , had less appeal; the decline in the 
                        Prairie
                     and Great Plains states was notable; and the South, except 
                        Florida
                    , had not gained. 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     gained approximately as many Hoosiers as did 
                        California
                    . 
                        Illinois
                     gained about 20,000, although the greater gains of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Michigan
                     produce an optical illusion that Illinois lost between 1910 and 1930.
            These maps illustrate four great principles or laws of population spread: 1) Nearby areas, unless
                    they have few people, tend to supply relatively many migrants. For example, most of the people
                    migrating into Indiana were born in an adjacent or nearby state, except that 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     supplied few to Indiana until their own population became considerable. 2) Migration
                    tends to take place along parallels of latitude rather than north-south. In the earlier years, the
                    movement was predominantly westward; in recent, years, the eastward component is significant. The
                    migration of many tens of thousands of families from 
                        Kentucky
                     into Indiana is partly an illustration of the westward movement

                     rather than of northern movement, because the southern part of
                    Indiana, into which most Kentuckians migrated, is west of the northern half of 
                        Kentucky
                    . (An appreciable movement from the South before the Civil War into Indiana reflected,
                    in part, a special political condition, a movement from slave states into a free state.) 3) Migrants
                    make up a decreasinp percentage decade by decade of the total population. In early years, nearly
                    everyone in Indiana was born elsewhere; in recent years, such people comprise only a relatively
                    small percentage of the state's population. 4) A fourth generalization supported by these
                    maps is that a large share of the population of the 
                        United States
                     is relatively mobile. Instead of spending their lives within a few miles of their
                    birthplace. as is true for most of the world's people, many natives of Indiana live in each
                    of the other states, and each of the other states have sent numerous representatives to Indiana.
            Thus, by way of summary: In the early decades, many non-Hoosiers migrated to Indiana. At the 1850
                    census, for example, about one-half of the state's population had been born in other states
                    or in foreign countries. Soon, however, many natives of Indiana migrated to other states. By 1880,
                    this number almost equalled the number of natives of other states living in Indiana. By 1900, about
                    650,000 Hoosiers were living in other states, and at the 1930 census, about 930,000. Although
                    corresponding data for the 1940 census are not yet available, it is quite probable that more than a
                    million Hoosiers were living in other states, or more than a third as many as were living in
                    Indiana. The number of natives of other states living in Indiana increased much more slowly. In 1850
                    there were about 390,000, in 1900 nearly 500,000, in 1940, perhaps, about 650,000. Thus while in
                    1850 only one-half of the people of Indiana were born in Indiana, eighty years later about
                    three-fourths were born in this state. and many more Hoosiers lived in other states than the natives
                    of other states who lived in Indiana (264,000 in 1910, 281,000 in 1920, and 227,000 in 1930). The
                    largest sources of migrants to Indiana have been 
                        Ohio
                    , 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        Illinois
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 
                        New York
                    , and 
                        Germany
                    . Conversely, the states to the west, notably 
                        Illinois
                    , 
                        Missouri
                    , 
                        Oklahoma
                    , and 
                        California
                     have received relatively many native Hoosiers, as have in recent years 
                        Michigan
                     and 
                        Ohio

                    through the various parts of the Country, being highly conducive to this end, it shall be the duty
                    of the General Assembly to provide, by law, for the improvement of such lands as are, or hereafter
                    may be granted, by the united States to this state, for the use of schools, and to apply any funds
                    which may be raised from such lands, or from any other quarters to the accomplishment of the grand
                    object for which they are or may be intended. But no lands granted for the use of schools or
                    seminaries of learning shall be sold by authority of this state, prior to the year eighteen hundred
                    and twenty; and the monies which may be raised out of the sale of any such lands, or otherwise
                    obtained for the purposes aforesaid, shall be and remain a fund for the exclusive purpose of
                    promoting the interest of Literature, and the sciences, and for the support of seminaries and public
                    schools. The General Assembly shall from, time to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to
                    encourage intellectual, Scientifical, and agricultural improvement, by allowing rewards and
                    immunities for the promotion and improvement of arts, sciences, commerce, manufactures, and natural

                    morality.
            Sect. 2. It shall be the duty of the General assembly, as soon as circumstances will permit, to
                    provide, by law, for a general system of education, ascending in a regular gradation, from township
                    schools to a state university, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.
            Sect. 3. And for the promotion of such salutary end, the money which shall be paid, as an equivalent,
                    by persons exempt from militia duty except, in times of war, shall be exclusively, and in equal
                    proportion, applied to the support of County seminaries; also all fines assessed for any breach of

                    cent to be reserved out of the proceeds of the sale of town lots, in the seat of Justice of such
                    county, for the use of a public library for such County, and at the same session, they shall
                    incorporate a library company, under such rules and regulations as will best secure its permanence,

            Civil War Recollections
            HENRY C. BARNETT
            
            When Abraham Lincoln went to 
                        Washington
                     in March, 1861, he was accompanied by a young man by the name of Ellsworth who had been
                    residing in the city of 
                        Chicago
                     for a short period of time. Soon after his arrival he went to 
                        New York
                     City and organized a number of young men, who had been on the 
                        New York
                     force of fire-fighters, into a company which later took the name of
                    "Zouaves." After they had marched to the city of 
                        Washington
                     they became celebrated for their splendid ability and fighting qualities. Ellsworth
                    became their Colonel, although at that time only about 23 or 24 years of age.
            One day there was observed flying from a hotel, in the city of 
                        Alexandria
                     on the opposite side of the Potomac, a new flag, the "Stars and
                    Bars," being the one adopted by the Confederacy. No sooner was this discovered than the
                    young officer, Ellsworth, proceeded to cross the river, and, ascending bhe stairway, pulled down the
                    flag. As he came down he was shot and killed by the hotel proprietor. This murderous outrage so
                    fired the Northern mind that the boys from cities, towns, and farms flocked to the banner of the
                    North, and armies were rapidly assembled.1 A little later that memorable and
                    inspiring song, "John Brown's Body Lies Molding in the Tomb," which was
                    being sung throughout the land, was frequently changed to "Colonel Ellsworth's
                    Body Lies Molding in the Tomb."
            During the conflict, many other songs, such as "Dixie's Land," were
                    composed and sung by almost everybody who had a voice, from the youngest to the oldest. Though of
                    Southern origin, "Dixie's Land" was sung by both the North and South, and
                    was played on fife and drum throughout the whole years of the war. Other songs were composed and
                    sung later on, such as "Marching Through 
                        Georgia
                    ," "Just Before the Battle, Mother," and "The Vacant
                    Chair." Among the Northern armies such songs as "Yankee Doodle" and
                    "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground" were popular. The South sought to woo the state
                    of 
                        Maryland
                     with the catchy song, "
                        Maryland
                    , My 
                        Maryland
                    ."

                            New York
                        ), VI (1931), 109–10.
            
            
            One song in particular was sung just after the battle of Laurel Hill and Cheat River. This fight was
                    one in which the three-month soldiers from Indiana took a prominent part. General Bob Garnett was in
                    command of part of the forces on the Confederate side.2 During the fighting he
                    got up on a log lying on the opposite side of a stream of water that separated the two armies, and
                    to show his defiance of the Northern soldiery, made a speech in which, like Goliath of old, he
                    defied the enemy. The result was the same, for he was shot. As the Northern soldiers were victorious
                    here someone composed a song, a portion of the words being as follows: "Ha, ha, ha, first
                    families of 
                        Virginia
                    , can't stand a Hoosier gunner, but like a stud of noble blood, you'll
                    make a splendid runner." Another song, similarly inspired, contained these words:
                    "Bob Garnett of the Confederate States of America has got his courage sticking, and bravely
                    swore the day before, he'd give Uncle Sam a licking."
            Because 
                        South Carolina
                     had passed an ordinance of secession in December, 1860, shortly after the election of
                    Lincoln to the presidency, there arose in the South a belligerent, sentiment against him and the
                    incoming administration, based on the assumption that there would be interference with slavery.
                    President Lincoln, to allay this bitterness on behalf of his Southern brethren, in his Inaugural
                    Address in March, 1861, declared that he had no intention of interfering with that institution. But
                    this was not enough, for the agitation went on gaining force, being fanned by hot-headed orators,
                    until the fury went beyond all bounds, and one state after another followed the example of the state
                    of 
                        South Carolina
                    .
            The most stunning shock to the whole country came on April 12, 1861, when the news was heralded from
                    one end of the country to the other that General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, who became famous
                    afterwards as a fighting rebel, had bombarded Fort Sumter and had shot down "Old
                    Glory." Sumter fell and the flag went down on the 14th day of April, after being bravely
                    defended by Major Robert Anderson and his eighty soldiers.
            The reaction of the people upon receipt of this distressing news was most awe-inspiring. Our father
                    had prepared some 
                  
                     2 Armistead C. Gordon, Jr., "Robert Selden Garnett,"
                            in Dictionary of American Biography, VII (1931), 158.
               
                     ground in which to sow oats, but none was sown that day. All
                    quit work as if the day of doom was at hand. Men gathered in groups with troubled faces. They were
                    much distressed as they tearfully met on the streets or came together at the yard fences. Civil war
                    now became inevitable, and the sound of the fife and drum was heard all over the land, North and
                    South. The President had been counseling forbearance and bidding for a peaceful solution, but to no
                    avail. Many favored allowing the South to go, saying it would solve the slavery question. Indeed,
                    some of the public press advocated the same. But as defiance of federal power grew more intense in
                    the South, this submissive attitude of the people changed. War was declared and the North and South
                    were at arms—the conflict was on. Lincoln called for 75,000 men, which number was soon in
                    camp and on the road south. Governor Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, in short order, tendered
                    Indiana's quota to the President. The men were called for three months, as the
                    Administration thought it would be all over in that time. Some of these men who were released in
                    July, came home, but others did not.
            People from all parts of the country-side gathered in schoolhouses or in the open air for the purpose
                    of hearing orators and recruiting officers who called for volunteers to serve for three years, or to
                    the end of the war. At all such meetings the ever present fife and drum, playing "Yankee
                    Doodle" and (‘The Girl I Left Behind Me’ inspired the younp and old
                    alike with military spirit. At one of these gatherings held on the commons near the creek that ran
                    through our farm, I saw as many as thirty or more boys fall in line within a space of a few mintes.
                    Saloons were open in those days and many of these boys had imbibed a little too freely and were a
                    part of Uncle Sam's army while under this excitement, but they made good soldiers for they
                    were not drunkards. This was Company B, 39th Indiana Infantry. My oldest brother, John L. Earnett,
                    was one of this company whose life was offered as a sacrifice for his country.
            Among the men who were prominent in raising an army was a native Irishman by the name of Reeves. In
                    his fiery speeches calling for volunteers, he closed by saying, "We know the danger but
                    before I will let these foul traitors triumph, they shall pass over my dead body, and that flag
                    [pointing to the Stars and Stripes] shall be my ‘winding  sheet.’" He became a Captain and came through the
                    War. but some of the boys under his command now sleep at Chickamauga and on other battle-fields.
            The time of departure was at hand. There were present a great number of people, including all classes
                    of citizens, old men and women, young boys and girls, and those who were going to the front. The
                    train rolled in, men went aboard. Mothers, fathers, and sisters were bidding their loved ones
                    farewell with tear stained faces. Among the crowd were weeping children whose fathers had joined the
                    army, for many men of families were among those leaving little ones at home. The steam was turned
                    on, and with the signal of the whistle, the train grew less distinct, as we gazed down the tracks,
                    until it finally was out of sight. Returning to their homes, friends took up the thread of life
                        again.3
            
            The long freight trains from northern Indiana and from 
                        Michigan
                     came down the old Peru railroad track bound for the South. In and on top of these
                    old-fashioned cars were hundreds of men, who, as they passed through town, stood cheering. Onward
                    they went, many never to return, and the "tumult and the shouting ceased" as the
                    train disappeared.
            As the war progressed, filling the ranks of volunteers became more difficult and when a township
                    failed to furnish its quota the government resorted to the draft until the required number was
                    secured. The ages included were eighteen to forty-five. No attention was given, as in the World War,
                    as to whether these men were single or were married. On the date of the drawing, the whole community
                    was wrought up until the result was known and the unlucky ones were notified of the selections. It
                    was not considered any special honor to be drafted.
            Men were allowed to hire substitutes, and many did so, in some instances they paid as high as one
                    thousand or twelve hundred dollars for others to go in their places. The usual price, however, ran
                    from two hundred to five or six hundred dollars. Many of these substitutes made very poor soldiers.
                    There were conscientious men, however, who refused to hire substitutes, for it would have been an
                    unpleasant remembrance 
                  
                     3 The writer has in his possession a replica of one of these war
                            meeting pictures, showing the dress of the soldiers and citizens of that day, including the
                            women's apparel. It is the work of artist W. L. Taylor, and is true to life,
                            showing the parting of lovers, serious minded young men, recruiting officers, and a weeping
                            mother.
               
                     afterward had the substitute died in the service either of
                    disease or in battle.
            In some counties the county commissioners offered bounties of different amounts for substitutes to
                    fill the ranks. These offers were accepted in good faith by many soldiers who served their term, but
                    the temptation enlisted many adventurers and professionals, who got their money from the county,
                    entered the army, and then deserted to go to some other county and repeat the performance. This gave
                    rise to the term "Bounty Jumpers." It was very difficult to do anything with these
                    men, for if they finally landed in the service and were making good, the government, needing their
                    services, could not afford to hunt up the matter in order to punish the crime. The practice of
                    allowing substitutes gave the man of means an advantage over the poor man, but the offering of
                    bounties worked the other way, for it taxed the man of wealth for the benefit of his poor neighbors.
            Some men, who had volunteered while this offer was in effect but without knowing of the offer, were
                    held to be entitled to the bounty. Probably twenty years after the close of the war, the firm of
                    which I was a member brought suit against 
                        Johnson County
                     for the bounty and recovered. to the best of my recollections, —200 in each
                    case. The Supreme Court, however, finally decided that the limitation had run against such claims.
            There was another temptation the government allowed, which was to pay men for securing volunteers.
                    This led some unscrupulous men to report certain names to the military authorities, which greatly
                    embarrassed these persons. I have personally known of men, by reason of this deception, who left
                    their homes and slept on beds of straw in the dense forests that then existed in the neighborhoods.
                    There may not have been any real danger, but they believed that there was and kept watch for
                    officers for days at a time.
            Deserters from the army became numerous during, and after, the year 1862, and the fastnesses of 
                        Brown
                     County became a rendezvous for these escaped soldiers. Mrs. Bar nett, who was then a
                    small girl, told me that she saw some of these men passing her home in 
                        Nineveh
                     township, tied in some manner to their captors or the horses on which they rode. One
                    night, immediately after the Battle of Perryville, 
                        Kentucky
                    , we heard a knock at the door of our home, and  on
                    opening, there stood three men in uniform who asked to stay all night. My father invited them in.
                    They said they were making their way to their homes but did not care if they could only have the
                    privilege of sleeping on the floor as they had for some time not been in the habit of using beds. Of
                    course, there was nothing to do but tell them they might stay, which they did, sleeping on the floor
                    immediately in front of a warm fire in the open fireplace.
            The next morning after my mother had given them their breakfast and they were ready to go, they asked
                    one of my older brothers whether he would like to exchange some of his clothing for one of their
                    army coats. He was glad to do this for the army coat was much better than the one he gave the
                    soldier. These men departed and we saw no more of them. but they left the impression with us that
                    they had only been in the army a few days before the Battle of Perryville and in that battle they
                    had been badly defeated. We surmised that they were deserters from the army. The army coal was not
                    of very much use to my brother for the reason that the government had forbidden civilians to wear
                    army clothes, and upon being apprised of this fact, my brother took his new found coat, dug a hole
                    in the straw stack, put the coat, in the hole, and stopped it up.
            One thing we all then realized was that war existed just across the 
                        Ohio
                     River, and men were liable to go into battle at any time after crossing it. Although
                    the regular army of the Confederacy was farther away, guerrilla bands were everywhere in 
                        Kentucky
                    , only awaiting opportunity to attack and destroy.
            Coming home from school one evening with others, we observed a new-made grave in the cemetery on my
                    father's farm. We stood around it in silence. It was the tomb of Arthur Turner, a neighbor
                    boy, who went away in high spirits. Soon afterward we saw a second, and this was the grave of
                    another boy from an adjoining farm, George Deakyne. This was the first fruit of war, and we began to
                    understand what war meant.
            The prcpaganda of hate soon developed in both North and South, for no war can be carried on
                    successfully without it, and all kinds of stories were put afloat to foster the war spirit. It was
                    not long until the people of the North regarded the rebels of the South as hideous beings, wholly
                    devoid of  any human sympathy and glorying in the misery of
                    others. We children used to say that we should like to meet a rebel to see what one looked like. We
                    thought they were a race of men entirely different from ourselves. Boys with guns would point at an
                    imaginary foe and pretend that they were killing Jeff Davis or other rebels.
            The Northern Methodists were bitterly opposed to human slavery. They were unlike the Friends or
                    Qualrers, who were equally opposed to slavery, but would not fight. About the time the war broke
                    out, the children of our family were going to school to a very prominent Methodist teacher, who.
                    very soon after his school closed, volunteered and went through the war.
            Besides the real soldiers who went to the front, there were many junior organizations of boys from
                    the ages of teri to twelve who played soldier. They elected officers, armed themselves with some
                    semblance of ornamentation, and drilled after the example of the army officers. Major John H. Tadton
                    told me he was captain of a company organized in th:. neighborhood of Greenwood. This company was
                    armed with cornstalks. I, too, played the captain of a company, some of whom had wooden swords and
                    other equipment of a similar character, while the captain possessed a cap of military imitation. My
                    brother, D. C. Barnett, who has been practicing law in the state of 
                        Missouri
                     for many years, was one of the boy soldiers.
            A boy about sixteen years of age of very poor family and of scant education disappeared on a frosty
                    morning in the fall of 1861. Just at daylight as I came out of our home this boy came through a
                    dense wood along the creek bottom, all alone, wearing an army cap and a blue army overcoat, with a
                    gun over his shoulder. He came up the creek and passe? over the bridge going toward the railroad,
                    where I suppose he boarded a train for the South.
            A soldier had left his family living in an abandoned schoolhouse in our little town of Cicero. The
                    boys heard he was home and hastened to see the first returned soldier. The door of his little humble
                    home was open, and there he sat at dinner with his family, uniform of blue still on, while many
                    neighbors gathered around the building. He was an object of adoration for all the town, and a hero
                    in the eyes of every boy.
            
            Large drafts upon the charity of the county were necessary. Families of small, helpless children were
                    left when their fathers enlisted, but the home folk were very kind in seeing that they did not
                    suffer. There were also several refugee families that came north from 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                     in the early years of the war. These people had left in great numbers, usually with
                    large families and without any means of support. They were, however, upright and law-abiding
                    citizens, many of whose descendants became permanent residents of the state. They had left the South
                    to escape persecution because of their sympathy with the North. So far as is known, all these people
                    and their descendants have voted the Republican ticket, which fact is not surprising when we
                    remember that the slave-owning population of the South belonged to the other party.
            In July, 1863, the guerrilla, John Morgan, with his band of followers crossed over the 
                        Ohio
                     River into Indiana, coming as far as 
                        North Vernon
                    , frightening the people, forcing the women to cook their meals, exchanging their worn
                    out horses for good ones, and creating consternation generally throughout the whole southern part of
                    the state. The report was current for a day or so that this band of "free-booters"
                    had come as far north as 
                        Columbus
                    , but they soon left the state, crossing over into 
                        Ohio
                     where Morgan was captured and imprisoned at 
                        Columbus
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    .
            In January, 1863, my father, Ambrose D. Barnett, passed through the lines to secure a furlough for my
                    brother, John L. Barnett, who was badly sick in a hospital at 
                        Nashville
                    . The rules of the War Department were so strict at that time that it was almost
                    impossible to secure a release of a sick soldier, until they found that he could not recover, and so
                    my father came home alone. In a few days, brother arrived one morning, and died the next. At that
                    time, my father told us that throughout the whole state of 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Tennessee
                    , through which he. passed, it was no uncommon thing to see chimneys standing where
                    guerrillas had burned the homes of Union sympathizers.
            One does not have to draw strongly upon his imagination to realize the distress the destruction of
                    human life brought to the citizens of 
                        Johnson County
                    . It was a land of mourning, for in almost every neighborhood there were mothers who,
                    like "Rachel of old were weeping for their children  and
                    would not be comforted because they were not." When the news of the Battle of 
                        Shiloh
                     flashed over the wires, the word came that 18,000 men had been killed in this one
                    engagement. As a great number of the boys from our immediate neighborhood was known to be engaged in
                    the battle, the shock to the community was one never to be forgotten. The high tension of feeling,
                    the suppressed excitement and the awful suspense were oppressive, and it was days before the parents
                    and relatives of the boys in the fight knew the fate of these boys so engaged.
            Many rumors were afloat concerning seditious schemes for the furtherance of the cause of secession,
                    some unfounded, but others seemingly with proof of their existence. One of these was to the effect
                    that certain sympathizers with the South had formed a conspiracy to seize the arsenals at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , capture or kill the Governor and other state officers, liberate the ten thousand rebel
                    prisoners then being held at Camp Morton at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and capture the city. thereby turning Indiana over to the South. Governor Morton, who
                    made a name as a terror to all whq opposed the war, is said to have suppressed the threatened
                    scheme.
            Indiana was chosen as a fertile field in which the Confederates could launch their schemes, for it is
                    just across the river from 
                        Kentucky
                     and most of the residents were of the South. Half of the state had been reared there
                    and had relatives there, and it. was taken for granted a more friendly feeling for the cause of the
                    South would be met in this state. 
                        Ohio
                     was populated more from the Eastern states.
            Growing out of the hatred engendered by the War and for some years after its close, certain persons,
                    friends and foes of each section, still were intent on keeping alive war's animosities.
                    Among such was one Brick Pomeroy, who published a paper at LaCross, 
                        Wisconsin
                    , which held a very vicious attitude toward President Lincoln. When it was reported that
                    the body of J. Wilkes Booth, the assassin of the president had been taken out to sea and consigned
                    to the waves, he wrote the following lines depicting the virtues of Booth, according to my memory:
                        
                        Yes, give him a sepulchre wide as the sweep,
                        Of the tidal waves measureless motion
                        Yes, put him to sleep in the arms of the deep
                        For his heart was as grand as the ocean—
                    
            
            
            And here is another from the pen of a writer whose sentiments differed from those of
                    Pomeroy's: 
                        Oh, may that cursed Jeff Davis float
                        In stormy sea, in open boat,
                        In Iceland's cold without a coat.
                        May sharks devour him stem to stern,
                        A whale then gulp him down in turn
                        And the devil get the whole concern,
                        Glory Hallelujah.
                    
            
            We have noticed of late many excuses being made by some prominent parties for the men of the South
                    who took up arms against the Union, ranging from General Beauregard, who, unprovoked, fired upon
                    Fort Sumter, to General Robert E. Lee. Some of these excuses are based on the fact that these men
                    belonged to the South, that they were born and reared in the South, and that it was the natural
                    thing to do. This excuse might have more weight if the North had been the assaulting party and if
                    the South had acted only in selfdefense, but let us ask who fired the first shot, and the answer
                    is—General Beauregard, when he shot down the country's flag at Sumter. Who
                    ravished the arsenals of the 
                        United States
                     and had the first army in the field? The answer is the South.
            This being the starting point, did it justify Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Generals Johnston,
                    Beauregard, and Stonewall Jackson, in stultifying themselves, after enjoying the protection and
                    benefit arising to them as citizens of the 
                        United States
                    , by taking up arms against it? It is said they were honest, but mistaken. Did any of
                    them ever say they were wrong? That they were able and had many virtues does not excuse them for
                    their effort to destroy the country that had given them birth and protected them in their rights as
                    citizens. Was Jefferson Davis justified in encouraging the destruction of the Union, after being
                    educated at the expense of this government and after taking the oath to support and defend the flag?
                    Can we justify General Lee, who, after acquiring a military education at West Point, slaughtered
                    thousands of Northern boys who were defending Old Glory, and who led his hosts on to conflict,
                    shooting down that same emblem of our country at every opportunity?
            During the period of the war, certain articles, which the people of the North were accustomed to
                    have, became  very scarce, and when they could be obtained were
                    very expensive. While the South had tobacco, sugar, and cotton, the North had wheat, corn, and a
                    larger supply of livestock. Cotton goods became very dear in the North and because of our inability
                    to get coffee, many families resorted to baked potatoes, or parched wheat for coffee, and instead of
                    cotton goods we raised flax for material for summer wear. Instead of sugar we made maple molasses
                    and maple sugar, and about this time sorghum was introduced from 
                        China
                    . I believe my father paid —1.25 for one pound of this seed.
            The North had sheep, and almost all clothing worn by men, women, and children was manufactured from
                    wool. The men sheared the sheep, the women picked out the burs, spanish needles, and other trash,
                    washed the wool, spun the yarn, wove the flannels, and cut out and made the garments for both sexes.
                    Some of the boys of this present day would not fancy wearing a home-made, coarse flannel shirt,
                    jeans-pants and coats for every day and also Sunday wear; and the girls would not feel at home in a
                    heavy, plain flannel dress, no frills or ornamentations, heavy cowhide shoes made by the
                    neighborhood shoemaker and kept soft by tallow grease. But the above is what the people of that day
                    had, and they were happy.
            In the years during the conflict, the people were content with the simple life. In addition to the
                    home-made food and clothing, the means of travel were generally walking, riding horseback, or riding
                    in two horse wagons, for very few had buggies or carriages. If the distance was only onc or two
                    miles, one would most frequently walk. On Sundays the young people generally rode. It was not
                    uncommon to see several couples in procession on the way to church, and afterwards in groups at the
                    home of some neighbor. The girls used side saddles and wore long riding skirts which reached below
                    their feet. The girls were not afraid of horses, but pulled up the reins with the same assurance as
                    their companions. It was a beautiful sight to see these cavalcades sweeping down the highway. The
                    older people went in the two horse wagons. On Saturday evening it was a common practice for the
                    whole family to gear up the horses and away to the home of some friend or relative to stay over
                    night without giving any previous notice.
            I do not remember any bank failures during the four and  one-half
                    years of the war. In fact, there were not many banks until the National banks were authorized near
                    the close of hostilities. Men kept their money at home. If necessary, money could generally be
                    borrowed from some farmer in the neighborhood, for there was usually some one in the community who
                    kept money to loan.
            I remember my father keeping in our home, during the late years of the war, about three thousand
                    dollars. IIc. did not lose one cent, although he had this money for many months. All the community
                    seems to have known it, and yet no robber broke into the home. There were no bars on the windows or
                    locks on the doors. One dark night, after my father received this money from the sale of some land,
                    would-be burglars came with a dark lantern that was visible in our yard. Intent on robbery, they
                    were scared off by the snapping of a small five-shooter that refused to go off. This frightened all
                    the children, who dreaded to see the next night come. But the burglars did not return. There was one
                    robbery about 1864, as I remember. Joseph Combs, an elderly gentleman who lived west of 
                        Franklin
                     in Union township. was beaten and robbed of a considerable sum of money.
            The private soldier of the Union army had a pretty blue uniform, made of wool, a blue cap with a
                    black bill, and broad, rather heavy leather shoes. He was also given a canteen to carry water, and a
                    knapsack for his blankets.4 But the Southern soldier wore what was called
                    "butternut," which was a dingy, unattractive uniform. So when a Republican wanted
                    to tantalize a Democrat he would do so by calling him a "butternut" and this
                    aggravated the latter so that in turn he would call the Republican an
                    "abolitionist" or "black Republican." Now and then some Democrat
                    boys or perhaps girls, in defiance, would wear a real butternut on the lapel of their coat or other
                    garment. Amidst all these provocations a most bitter feeling and party hatred arose, culminating at
                    times in free fisticuffs.
            In the town of 
                        Williamsburg
                     [now known as 
                        Nineveh
                    ], there were two ardent Republican boys about the ages of fifteen or sixteen who took
                    great delight in annoying Democrats 
                  
                     4 The army uniform was in evidence long after the close of the war,
                            the blue overcoat being used extensively by returned soldiers or other persons who had
                            secured them in some way from individual soldiers or dealers in such articles. The army
                            shawl also survived many years after the close of the rebellion.
               
                     of the village or persons of that political faith who passed
                    through. One of these was William McNaughton, a son of a Methodist preacher. He later operated a dry
                    goods store in this city. The other was Tee Belk. I can now see these two young fellows on the
                    sidewalks of the little town, Billie McNaughton with his army shawl over his shoulders, disputing
                    and exchanging epithets with members of the opposite party, and Tee Belk ready for a fight.
            The political rallies of those days were something fierce. It was generally understood that at all
                    these gatherings there would be present a gang of bullies from the other party, that free fights
                    would be in order, and that there would be no interference by the police officers an such occasions.
                    On the day of such gatherings, drunken men on the streets of 
                        Franklin
                     would stand on the corners and sidewalks and engage in loud vindicative and profane
                    harangues, and abuse the other party and its officers. This was carried on for hours at a time, with
                    no interference. Saloons were open and liquor flowed freely. In these days if a man expected an
                    office he had to be a "wet," for if a temperance man bobbed up, he was sure of
                    defeat, and one who would not pay for the drinks was declared unfit for office.
            Like the "Silver and Gold Democrats" in the time of William J. Bryan, the
                    Democratic Party of the North was divided as early as 1862 or 1863 into what was called the
                    "Regulars" and the "War Democrats." The former contended that
                    President Lincoln was carrying on the war and making sacrifices of white men in order to free the
                    colored men. This may not have been all the story, for, when the presidential election of 1864 came
                    on, "Old Man Politics" reared his ugly head, and, as he always does, blinded the
                    better judgment of men and made them his servants. As General George B. McClellan was the Democratic
                    candidate for president against Lincoln, there may have been much resentment at least on his part,
                    and the part of his friends because he was removed from his high command by President Lincoln after
                    the Battle of 
                        Antietam
                    . It was necessary, also, to make some kind of an issue before a fight. History has
                    recorded the story of this grievous mistake of both the leader and his followers, which kept the
                    losing party out of power for twenty years. Many of those who opposed further bloodshed were honest
                    patriotic persons, many had sons in the army, and  many had lost
                    members of their families, but time has demonstrated that they were wrong.
            A great majority of the soldiers who returned from the war voted with the Republican Party, because
                    they were opposed to slavery and because the Regular Democrats opposed the continuation of the war.
                    The army seemed to be favorable to Lincoln and the soldier vote contributed largely to his
                    re-election. The charge was made that this vote was unduly cast in some manner, but the fact remains
                    that the soldiers who came home voted the Republican ticket.
            There were numerous charges of irregularities in elections committed by Republicans during these
                    tempestuous days. It was charged that in one election in 
                        Franklin
                     township the Republican majority was in excess of the total votes of the township. The
                    count of the ballots was not made until the day after election, the box having been kept by a member
                    of the party in a bank in this city over-night. It is said that the individual in later years only
                    smiled when the matter was suggested to him.
            After the death of President Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, a resident of 
                        Tennessee
                    , who had been elected vice-president, succeeded to the presidency. Many doubts were
                    entertained as to what kind of an executive he would make, as it was feared by many that he might be
                    in sympathy with the South. Especially was this true of the Republican Party which had elected him.
            It was not long after his incumbency into office that a difference arose between Congress and the new
                    president, which grew more apparent and widespread until it developed into a violent antagonism.
                    This antagonism, instead of abating, increased until impeachment proceedings were instituted to
                    depose him from his high position. The charges preferred were high crime and misdemeanors and it was
                    claimed he had been guilty of such, more specific matters being set forth as required by law.
            After the trial, which lasted considerable time, during which there was great excitement throughout
                    the country, the Democratic press and politicians were generally favorable to the
                    President's acquittal, although having opposed his election. On the contrary, the press and
                    politicians of the Republican party were generally desirous of his conviction,  When the vote came he was acquitted. The ballots showed one vote short
                    of the two-thirds necessary to convict.
            In those strenuous days the boys were not slow in taking an active interest in politics and as our
                    family was Democratic, we were also very anxious to see the prosecution fail. The vote was taken, as
                    my memory serves me, on May 16, 1868, in the afternoon, and being so interested in the result, the
                    writer and two brothers were looking for an omen and were considerably discouraged during the whole
                    morning and until noon on account of the clouds shutting out the sunshine. About two
                    o'clock in the afternoon, the sun suddenly peeped from behind the mists and we took it for
                    a sign that the President would triumph, which he did. But his administration had been so badly
                    crippled by his conduct and the trial that he quit without accomplishing any great good.
            In order to vindicate his policy he made a speaking tour through the country which was called his
                    "swing around the circle." In doing so he passed through 
                        Franklin
                     where he made a short address from the car platform. The Reverend Willett Tyler, a
                    strong Democrat, a preacher of the Old School Baptist Church, and a former recorder of 
                        Johnson County
                    , stood upon a pile of rails near the railroad track and addressed the President in the
                    following language: "Andrew Johnson, President of the 
                        United States
                    , stand by the Constitution and the laws, and the Democracy of 
                        Johnson County
                     will stand by you." The President felt vindicated by the assurance that the
                    members of the party, that had tried to defeat him, were for him in at least one county.
            It was almost pathetic to witness the craze the young people manifested about this time for
                    education. A person who had a diploma from college was then looked upon as it wonder. At that time,
                    I had never seen a college graduate that I knew to be one, except our teacher, Reverend John C.
                    Miller, and A. V. Pendleton, both of whom were living in our neighborhood. I learned afterward that
                    Judge D. D. Banta and Doctor W. T. Stott were college graduates. There may have been others, but
                    these were the only ones known to me.
            The first high school in Indiana, it is said, was instituted, owned, and conducted by the Reverend
                    John C. Miller, in what was formerly the old Christian Church in 
                        Nineveh
                    . It first opened its door, as I remember, in the autumn of 1867,  a little more than two years after the war closed. Miller was a
                    graduate of the state university of Indiana. He was an experienced and wonderful teacher, as well as
                    a great preacher. This school at once sprang into prominence and young men and young women flocked
                    to its doors from different parts of Indiana. A few came from 
                        Kentucky
                     and 
                        Missouri
                    . The curriculum consisted of all the common branches, Latin, Greek, higher mathematics,
                    grammar, and bookkeeping.
            Sometimes every evening, but always once a week in the schools of that day, all the classes dropped
                    their books and sang "The State of 
                        Maine
                    , Augusta on the Kennebec River," and the rest of the states and all of the
                    other countries. In this way, even the least of the scholars learned all these capitals and the
                    rivers on which they were located, within a few weeks without any study. After the war closed, some
                    "higher-ups" laughed geography-singing out of the schools. It has been asserted
                    today that only a few of the high school and college graduates can tell the capitals of onefourth of
                    the states and the foreign countries. As to lessons on good breeding and good wholesome literature,
                    "Old McGuffy" will never be excelled.
         
         
         
            INDIANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY
            CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN
            
            A portrait of John Gibson (May 23, 1740—April 10, 1822) has long been a desideratum.
                    Gibson was the first, last, and only Secretary of Indiana Territory, 1800–1816. He
                    arrived at 
                        Vincennes
                     months before the Governor, William Henry Harrison, and from July 4, 1800 to January,
                    1801, he was acting governor; it was he who put in operation the government of the newly created
                    territory. He was also acting governor from the time Harrison left the Territory for his military
                    command in June, 1812, until the arrival of Thomas Posey in April, 1813 (See p. 819,
                    "Roster of Territorial Officers," etc., printed as Appendix III in Laws of Indiana Territory 1809–1816, edited by Louis B. Ewbank and Dorothy
                    Riker, published by the Indiana Historical Bureau, 1934).
            Aside from his position in Indiana, General John Gibson's career was both significant and
                    picturesque. After an education better than that of most boys of his time, he took part in the
                    expedition of General Forbes which captured Fort Duquesne and changed the fort and settlement into 
                        Pittsburgh
                    . Staying there as a trader, he was captured by the Indians and saved from death by
                    being adopted. His Indian wife was a sister of Chief Logan, whose famous speech in 1774 he
                    preserved. Gibson participated in Lord Dunmore's War and raised a regiment which he led
                    during part of the war of the American Revolution in 
                        Washington
                    's army. After the war he engaged in Indian trading at 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , was a member of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Constitutional Convention, for several years was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas
                    of Allegheny County, and was a general in the state militia. The last years of his life were spent
                    at Braddock's Field, near 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , the home of his daughter, Mrs. George Wallace.
            An old oil portrait, described on the reverse of the picture as a portrait of General John Gibson and
                    presented to his daughter, Mrs. George Wallace, was brought to light last spring in correspondence
                    with Mrs. M. Carey, 1079 Third Avenue, 
                        New York
                     City. Tradition was said to have ascribed the portrait to Charles Willson Peale, but no
                    evidence of  this has been found. The portrait was bought by Eli
                    Lilly, president of the Indiana Historical Society and by him has recently been placed in the
                    William Henry Harrison house at 
                        Vincennes
                    .
            A study of the portraits of the governors of Indiana, with some account of the men who painted them,
                    is listed for publication by the society this year. Wilbur D. Peat, director of the John Herron Art
                    Museum, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , is the author. Mr. Peat has been engaged for several years in photographing early
                    portraits of Indiana citizens throughout the state and in learning everything that is to be found
                    about the portraits and their painters. He has made a special study of the portraits of the
                    governors in the State Capitol. The publication is to contain reproductions of the portraits; it is
                    a contribution to the history of art as well as to Indiana biography.
            Since the printing in the December number of the Indiana Magazine of History (pp.
                    382–83) of the suggesticjn that steps be taken in all the counties of the state toward
                    the ultimate production of adequate and dependable histories of the counties, it is reported that a
                    history of one county by a high school history teacher, in progress for several years, is nearing
                    completion. Inquiries from four counties indicate interest in the project. There seems to be ground
                    for hope that other counties, either through their historical societies, or through individual
                    enterprise, will soon begin the collection of data and the production of chapters for future county
                    histories. There are few, if any, counties of the state in which there are not resident some college
                    graduates who have had training in the study and writing of history in their college courses. In
                    most counties there are selfeducated persons who are deeply interested in the history of their
                    communities and who have made more or less study of some phase of their history. It might be
                    possible in this generation, by concerted movement, to produce a complete series of county histories
                    which would, at least, give a great impetus to scholarly study and teaching of local history.
            Thus far, our historical output, while fairly extensive, has been fragmentary and of an exceedingly
                    variable quality. No one could claim that it has given us a clear understanding of our past or of
                    the development of our institutions and our people. Is it not time to undertake a more ambitious
                    effort  to develop historical studies in a more scientific and
                    systematic way? It must be admitted that there are not, at present, many channels for the
                    publication of all worth-while writings upon local history, but such an effort might well open
                    channels, not only for the production of a better quality of historical writings but for the
                    publication of products which deserve being put into printed form and wider circulation.
            At this time of year the Indiana Historical Society appeals to college teachers of history to enlist
                    the interest of those who are majoring in this subject in the continuation of their historical
                    reading and study in association with the members of historical societies. Before long they will
                    receive an information-application folder from the Indiana Historical Society for nomination for
                    membership in the society of those seniors who might reasonably be expected to appreciate the work
                    in the society. This year many of the men who graduate will be taken into the armed forces of the 
                        United States
                     and can hardly be expected to establish themselves in a community. It is all the more
                    desirable. however, that a continuation of their intellectual pursuits should be held before them,
                    as well as before others who go at once into civilian life.

            THE FIRST WABASH SONG
            KARL J. ARNDT
            
            When the Harmonists discovered that their land in 
                        Butler
                     County, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , was unsuitable for the cultivation of the vine, they petitioned Congress to give them
                    special terms for purchase of a large piece of Congressional land in a milder region in the West.1 Because the final vote on their petition was a tie, it was up to the speaker
                    to give the decision. He was opposed to the measure, so the Rappites remained in 
                        Butler
                     County long enough to accumulate sufficient money to enable them to buy lands without
                    depending on the good will of politicians.
            In the first months of the year 1814 George Rapp and several companions went exploring for a new site
                    on which to build another city. They found what they wanted on the banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    . Soon after the new arrangements had been completed an advance group of Harmonists left 
                        Butler
                     County to prepare the way for the migration of the entire Harmony Society. This
                    separation from the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     community, the new difficulties and hardships which they experienced in turning the
                    wilderness into a wellplanned town, made them feel sad even in their beautiful surroundingi. Quite a
                    few of the advance group suffered severely from fever, and a number of these died. The fact that
                    their Father Rapp had to return to 
                        Pennsylvania
                     himself for a time made them feel very unhappy. With great love and understanding he
                    encouraged them by his letters and poems. It was in these circumstances that the Wabasch Lied, printed here for the first time, was written.
            For the benefit of those who do not read German the following prose summary is given. 1. Our farewell
                    has been sad indeed, everyone here wishes he could be with you and that father and son would again
                    be united. 2. Let us always remain steadfast anc! loyal to our ideal of Harmony. Through suffering
                    and joy we will join you. Hear the echo of our song: 
                        Wabash
                    , 
                        Wabash
                    , soon we will see. 3. This

                            Jefferson," American-German Review (

                     time will soon come. Soon spring will appear. After two months
                    we, too, will be on our way. Hear the echo of our song:

                    peace with those of good will. If only that were today! Rejoice with me, for soon we shall see our 
                        Wabash
                     land. 5. 
                        Wabash
                    , oh, you lovely land, just to think of you here fills my heart with joy. Hear the echo
                    of our song: 
                        Wabash
                    , 
                        Wabash
                    , soon we will see. 6. Hear, oh hear, dear ones, hear the echo of our song. Let us make
                    joyous music, for soon we will see the 
                        Wabash
                    . Hear the echo of our song:

                        Wabasch Lied 
                        1. Traurig ist der Abschied worden
                        Traurig geht es immer her
                        Jedes aechzet, jedes jammert:
                        Ach, wenn ich doch bei euch wär',
                        Da wär' dann der süsse Ton,
                        Bei einander Vater und Sohn.
                        2. Laszt uns immer standhaft bleiben,
                        Laszt uns immer sein getreu!
                        Durch viel Leiden, durch viel Freuden
                        Kommen wir auch noch herbei.
                        Hört, ach hört, wie's wiederschallt:
                        Wabasch, Wabasch, sehen wir bald.
                        3. Diese Zeit wird endlich kommen,
                        Bald, bald tritt der Friihling an,
                        Noch zwei Monat zu erwarten,
                        So geht es auf unsere Bahn.
                        Hört, ach hört, wie's wiederschallt:
                         Wabasch, Wabasch, sehen wir bald.
                        4. Diese Zeit wird endlich kommen,
                        Dass wir bei einander sein,
                        Leben im Frieden mit dent Frommen,
                        Ach, könnt es doch heute sein!
                        Ach so freuet euch mit mir,
                        Bald sehen wir die Wabasch Revier.
                        5. Wabasch, O Du schöne Ebene,
                        Voller Freuden machst mich hier,
                        Wenn ich nur an dich gedenke
                        
                     
                        2 I hope some poetic reader will do justice to the original German
                                by providing a suitable translation in verse. The original German has some traces of
                                Suabian dialect. These have been changed to standard German in the poem printed here.
                                The original manuscript is in (he Harmony Society Archives, Economy, 
                                    Pennsylvania
                                .
                  
                        
                        So freu ich mich über Dir!
                        Hört, ach hört, wie's wiederschallt:
                        Wabasch, Wabasch, sehen wir bald.
                        6. Hört, O hört, ach hört Ihr Lieben,
                        Hört, ach hört, wie's wiederschallt,
                        Lasst uns prächtig musizieren,
                        Weil wir sehen den Wabasch bald.
                        Hört, ach hört, wie's wiederschallt:
                         Wabasch, Wabasch, sehen wir bald.
                    
            
            After all the members of the Harmony Society had moved to the new home on the 
                        Wabash
                    , many other poems were written, but most of these were religious. They were published
                    by the Society's press in 1824,3 shortly before the Rappites turned 
                        New Harmony
                     over to Robert Owen. Owen's arrival brought more poetry to the 
                        Wabash
                    , perhaps too much. In view of the history of the two groups it is highly interesting to
                    compare the above song of the Rappites with the following one sung by the Owen party on shipboard,
                    en route to 
                        New Harmony
                    . 
                        Land of the West, we come to thee,
                        Far o'er the desert of the sea;
                        Under thy white-winged canopy,
                        Land of the West, we fly to thee;
                        Sick of the Old World's sophistry;
                        Haste then across the dark, blue sea,
                        Land of the West, we rush to thee!
                        Home of the brave: soil of the free,—
                        Huzza! She rises o'er the sea.4

                  1 This document shows that all was not buckskin and homespun in pioneer
                        days. The settlers in the back country and the rural militia at their musters undoubtedly wore
                        more simple garb, but in the towns a modish dress might be seen. The original document is in the

            When Lincoln evaded Senator Wade's demand for the removal of Grant with a story,
                    "Bluff Ben" could not contain himself. "It is with you, sir, all story,
                    story! You are the father of every military blunder that has been made during the war. This
                    government is on the road to hell, sir, by reason of your obstinacy…. " (N. W.
                    Stephenson, comp., An Autobiography of Abraham Lincoln, p. 416). It was
                    Lincoln's obstinate moderation, of course, that saved the Border States and the Union, but
                    at the cost of alienating radicals in his own party who were grimly resolved to make a revolution of
                    the Civil War and to destroy slavery and the Old South. Their divergent policies gave rise to a
                    bitter conflict between President and Congress which foreshadowed reconstruction. Rhodes, Randall
                    and other students have investigated this crucial contest for power. But Professor Harry Williams of 
                        Louisiana
                     State University has written the most extensive and interesting account of the radicals
                    during the war; for their main political agency, the Committee on the Conduct of the War, it is
                    probably definitive.
            Under the leadership of Wade and Chandler this congressional committee became "the spearhead
                    of the radical drive against the administration [p. 641]." In secret hearings, often
                    without a quorum, they sat as political commissars of the Northern armies. Ignorant of military
                    strategy but animated by their principles of attack, confiscation and emancipation, they promoted
                    and degraded generals, and hounded McClellan with "almost paranoiac" zeal (p.
                    185). Lincoln's search for commanders like Grant and Sherman who could win the war,
                    whatever their party or their views of the Negro, was constantly hampered by the radicals; they were
                    much more concerned with how the war was waged and for what partisan ends. Their
                    favorites—McDowell. Frémont, Pope, 
                        Butler
                     and Burnside—were incompetent in the field but correct in politics. Mr.
                    Williams demonstrates at great length that "the entire conduct of the war was shot through
                    with politics [p. 87]." Southern historians who have attributed the collapse of the
                    Confederacy to internal  quarrels might profitably reconsider how
                    divided and inefficient the North was, but without losing the war.
            Professor Williams adds nothing new to what Rhodes and Channing have told us of radical intrigues to
                    purge the Cabinet of Seward, Smith, Bates and Blair, to defeat Lincoln's renomination, to
                    force his hand in emanicipation, and to deprive him of the initiative in reconstruction. But these
                    negotiations loom larger in this book as part of the movement to replace presidential with
                    parliamentary government. Since the radicals could not capture their own party an.! remained a
                    minority in Congress until 1866, they were driven to measures which had the twofold purpose of
                    destroying presidential independence and forestalling a resurgence of Southern opposition. It is
                    evident from Mr. Williams' study that the roots of reconstruction were dug deep in the war
                    years, and it is a misnomer to think of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Early in 1862 Thaddeus
                    Stevens declared that Congress, not the President, should be dictator, and the radicals imagined
                    themselves dictators of Congress.
            If this excellent study is to be criticized at all, it is for not showing us how the radicals gained
                    power with the public or how they used it in Congress. Although Mr. Williams calls Wade and Chandler
                    the "Jacobin bosses" and frequently writes of their "radical
                    machine," not once does he examine the operation of this machine on the floor of Congress,
                    in caucus, and at the polls. He recognizes as fully as Beard or Beale that the economic and social
                    policies of the radicals made them Jacobins (pp. 7–9), but he confines his study to their
                    dealings with Lincoln, Stanton and the generals; their connection with tariff, taxation, railway,
                    land and currency legislation he fails to explore. This might well be the subject of a companion
                    volume. The only minor criticism worth making is that the author over-simplifies the radical
                    position on Negro suffrage; not until after the War did even Thaddeus Stevens come to accept it (p.
                    319; cf. Congressional Globe, p. 536, January 31, 1866). Finally it should be
                    observed that historians continue to treat the radicals without sympathy, and Mr. Williams is no
                    exception. However short-sighted their goals, however unscrupulous their tactics, the radicals
                    deserve to be studied in a larger persrective. Then we may hope to understand why they possessed the
                    dynamic power to make the War a struggle for their ideas of liberty.

            The reader of this third volume in the new history of the state of 
                        Ohio
                    , is taken, by way of introduction, on a tour of the cities of the state as they existed
                    in the second quarter of the nineteenth century. 
                        Toledo
                    , Sandusky, 
                        Cleveland

                        Springfield
                    , 
                        Dayton
                    , and 
                        Cincinnati
                     are the principal points visited, somewhat after the manner of John Bach McMaster in
                    his History of the People of the 
                            United States
                        
               . The point of the chapter is the development of urban life in an agricultural
                    state which was passing from the frontier stage. This is followed by a survey of the various
                    elements of 
                        Ohio
                    's population beginning with the Indians, the last of whom were removed from
                    the state during this period. The presence of a few thousand Negroes kept the state from being a
                    white man's country and also preserved considerable hostilty to the black race. The
                    migration of settlers from the older sections of the nation is also described in detail. The
                    agricultural activities and the beginning of industrial developments are pictured. The contents of
                    the fourth chapter are indicated by the title, "Modes of Transportation—Old and
                    New." Because the subject involves the change from rivers, roads, and canals to railroads
                    the chapter is more of a historical treatment than the previous chapters.
            Nearly one hundred pages are devoted to the social history of the period, in which
                    "Recreation and Sociability," "Religion and Education," and
                    "Literature, Science, and the Arts" are treated. The political developments of the
                    years oi the Jacksonian movement and the rise of the Whig Party require a longer description in
                    which the Panic of 1837 is subordinated to the political story. The anti-slavery movement forms
                    something of an interlude before the political narrative is resumed in connection with the
                    presidential campaign of 1840. The volume closes with a discussion of banking and sectional problems
                    as they affected the politics of the state.
            
            It is obvious from this brief review of the contents of the volume that the author considers the
                    economic, political, and social aspects of his subject. Although this is to his credit, it is
                    permissible to raise a question that is not confined to this particular volume. How much historical
                    development or change is necessary to entitle a descriptive treatment to be called history?
                    Conversely, does the lack of change within the period assigned to an author cause a narrative to
                    become something else than history? Let it be said at the beginning that the historical character of
                    this volume as a whole is not questioned, although portions of the work justify raising the
                    question. The problem seems to be inherent in the social approach to history, particularly when the
                    period to be treated is a short one. It also seems to be increased as a result of the small amount
                    of interpretation which the author offers his reader. Too often the narrative is merely a citation
                    of so much of this and so much of that, so many hogs or cattle, so many foreign born or so many
                    natives of Southern states or of New 
                        England
                    . Certain chapters like the one on transportation and those on political developments
                    are exceptions. Others like the surveys of the cities, the population elements, agriculture,
                    industrial beginnings, and parts of the treatment of social events raise the question whether a
                    longer period of time ought not to have been assigned to the author. Perhaps there was more change
                    than readily meets the eye, which a more interpretative account might have pointed out.
            A few minor points may be mentioned such as the lack of related details on the maps, especially those
                    illustrating the transportation network (p. 99, and 116). The rivers of the state should have been
                    added. Since Middleton is involved in the discussion (p. 98) it might have been indicated also. More
                    attention should have been paid to the process of clearing the land and to the making of potash.
                    Sheepraising and ship-building seem to have been passed over too quickly.
            In fairness to the author and to those who share with him the honor of producing this work, it must
                    be said that it is a highly creditable volume. It is a thorough study of the period by an
                    experienced investigator and writer. It is scholarly and unbiased.
         
         
         
            
               Methodism and the Frontier, Indiana Proving Ground. By Elizabeth K. Nottingham. (
                        Columbia
                     University Press. 
                        New York
                    , 1941. Pp. viii, 231. —2.50.)
            A critical and scientific analysis of the influence of the frontier in the 
                        United States
                     upon the development of the Methodist Episcopal Church was attempted by the author of
                    this volume. To a considerable extent the study was localized in southeastern Indiana, but the
                    generalized treatment and the extensive references to, and description of the English backgrcund
                    often crowded the Indiana locale out of the picture. The author combined the methods of the
                    historian, the sociologist, the psychologist, and the student of comparative religions. The study is
                    not, however, a history of Methodism on the frontier or in southeastern Indiana.
            The problem of the study is described in the opening chapter as the determination of the manner in
                    which the "divergences of environment modified the subsequent development of Methodism in
                    America," the divergences being those found on the frontier in southeastern Indiana. A
                    description of this area is given in the second chapter. It is built around the life and experiences
                    of the Reverend Allen Wiley, who was a Methodist circuit rider. In the third chapter the creed and
                    organization which enabled this church to become the most numerous in this area are declared to have
                    been imported from 
                        England
                     with only slight modification. Their significance is revealed by contrasting them with
                    corresponding features of other churches. The secular developments in southeastern Indiana are more
                    extensively described in the fourth chapter, entitled "Methodism Comes of Age,"
                    than are the religious changes. The career of Robert R. Roberts, "the Frontier
                    Bishop," is utilized to indicate the more democratic character of the episcopal office on
                    the frontier in contrast to its position in an older society (chapter five). "The Structure
                    of Methodism," chapter six, pictures the differences in Methodist organization in the 
                        United States
                     as contrasted with 
                        England
                    . One very important difference was the development of a strong central authority in the
                    episcopal office in the 
                        United States
                    , which the author believes was largely due to the needs of the frontier. The price for
                    this development in a democratic country was continued controversy and schism of discontented
                    elements (chapter seven). Doctrinal and social differences in the  districts that were outgrowing the frontier stage continued to flourish and to draw off the more
                    discontented, but thc desire for efficiency maintained the system unchanged and prevented any very
                    serious divisions. Methodism adapted itself to the passing of the frontier and the development of a
                    middle class urban society (chapter eight). The disappearance in 
                        England
                     of the highly emotional evangelism with its attendant bodily effects and its
                    development in the 
                        United States
                     into the chief recruiting method of the Methodist Church is attributed in the last two
                    chapters to the frontier., where an isolated rural people whose emot;onalism was not, restricted by
                    a highly respected church with a developed liturgy and ceremonialism or by the necessity of
                    reporting for work six or seven days a week.
            The work has certain deficiencies which are minor in character and which do not particularly lessen
                    its value, although it is unfortunate that they were not eliminated before publication. The language
                    used in describing geographical features of southeastern Indiana and neighboring parts of 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Kentucky
                     are confusing to the reader. "Up the 
                        Ohio
                    " is used (p. 10) where "down the 
                        Ohio
                    " would be more correct. "While the Great Miami flows toward the east
                    into what is now the 
                        Ohio
                    , the Whitewater takes n course almost due north…. " is certainly an
                    erroneous statement (p. 10). The former flows south and west but not east, while the latter flows
                    south and not north. The confluence of the 
                        Ohio
                     with the Whitewater and Great Miami rivers is referred to (p. 32), but certainly the
                    author knows that the Whitewater flows into the Great Miami and not the 
                        Ohio
                    . The description of a circuit (p. 47) is confusing for, after stating that it followed
                    the Whitewater. River, the author has the preacher in 
                        Kentucky
                     in between appointments along the Whitewater. Obviously he would not have doubled and
                    redoubled his steps in this roundabout manner. "By 1818," according to the author, "
                        Madison
                     [Indiana] boasted two local papers, the Indiana Republican and the
                        Western Sun…. [p. 71]." The Western Sun
                    was published in 
                        Vincennes
                     not 
                        Madison
                    , but the Western Eagle was published in 
                        Madison
                     for a time and when it moved to 
                        Lexington
                     its place was taken by the Indiana Republican. Consequently 
                        Madison
                     would hardly have boasted of these two papers. In describing pioneer conditions (p. 29)
                    it is  stated that "It was not until 1809 that Governor
                    Harrison… succeeded in freeing from Indian claims most of thc territory south of 
                        Indianapolis
                    ," but a glance at Esarey's History of Indiana, I,
                    272, which work is cited in that very paragraph, would have revealed the inaccuracy of that
                    statement. Other errors in respect to land follow, as (p. 59) the statement that Congress in 1822
                    cut the price from —2.00 to —1.25 an acre. The act was passed in 1820. Such
                    statements as the following do not increase the reader's confidence in the
                    author's freedom from extremes: "The slavery issue between North and South was but
                    an index of the divergent economic interests between the two areas [p. 140]"; and "Hence
                    the political ideals of Jefferson… in the last analysis involved a species of political
                    anarchy… [p. 151]."
            The above points are connected with the background in which the religious developments were cast, but
                    it is also possible to find some deficiencies in the major field. Peter Cartwright is a favorite
                    illustration with this author as with many others, but it is doubtful that Cartwright, "by
                    moving with the frontier, was able to some extent to recapture the spirit of former days."
                    It seems quite likely that he witnessed in his later days the same transformation in central 
                        Illinois
                     that Wiley, with whom he was contrasted, witnessed in southeastern Indiana. The
                    statement was qualified but even so the comparison is hardly accurate. Jesse Walker of 
                        Illinois
                     would have served the purpose much better. It is doubtful that Cartwright's
                        Autobiography should be referred to (p. 172) as a "lusty damnatory
                    one." In like manner one might question the inference that he was "a dash of
                    genius allied to a touch of madness [p. 14]…. " Generally, however, the author
                    shows good understanding of Cartwright and treats him fairly. A more serious error is that the vast
                    amount of background material is less well understood and often seems to crowd the major story from
                    the reader's attention. Even though there may be some modern overemphasis on the unworthy
                    aspects of the campmeeting the work is a keen analysis of religious developments.
            This volume will be of interest to students of religion, of Indiana history, and of the frontier
                    period of the 
                        United States
                    . It will also have a bearing on the controversy ovei. the "Turner
                    thesis," for it represents a study of actual developments rather than the too familiar
                    arguments of various  historians which are based upon what they
                    think rather than upon a study of developments.

               . By Ross F. Lockridge. (Published by the 
                        New Harmony
                     Memorial Commission,

            This attractive paper-bound pamphlet from the pen of the Director of the 
                        New Harmony
                     Memorial Commission will appeal to everyone interested in the Rappite period of 
                        New Harmony
                     history. Others who may read it will become interested in the unique annals of the
                    Rappite community on the banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    . The story is more than a description of the Labyrinth as it includes a brief study of
                    its creators, the 
                        New Harmony
                     Society. In addition, interesting material is presented dealing with five other
                    historic labyrinths, with a general statement relative to various church labyrinths and the Etruscan
                    labyrinths. There are also sections dealing with the labyrinth in literature, art, games and
                    pageantry.
            The 
                        New Harmony
                     Labyrinth, which was permitted to pass out of existence in the years following the
                    return of the Rappites to 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , has been recently restored. The design of the restoration is as nearly as possible the
                    same as that of the original. The new site is a plot of ground adjacent to the space occupied by the
                    original. The plants marking the winding and intricate paths of the restored Labyrinth consist
                    mainly of Amoor River Privet. The old hedgerows were formed of "wild river privet together
                    with flowering trees and shrubs and some thorn trees." Trees have not been used in the
                    Restoration. 'The building placed in the center of the Labyrinth by the Rappites was
                    constructed of wood. The new building which will be known as the Temple is
                    constructed of stone.
            In his description of the original Labyrinth, the author quotes from several persons who observed it
                    while still preserved. The description by Robert Dale Owen which was included in his autobiography,
                        Threading My Way, seems the most reliable of all. Owen refers to the Labyrinth
                    as a playground, but he believed that it had a significance in relation to the lives that Rapp
                    wished the members of his community  to follow. "Thus
                    George Rapp had sought to shadovforth to his followers," says Owen, "the
                    difficulties of attaining a state of peace and social harmony." This much was symbolized by
                    the maze of paths by which the shrine could be reached by a successful seeker. Owen adds this keen
                    interpretation: "The perplexing approach, the rough exterior of the shrine, and the
                    elegance displayed within were to serve as types of toil and suffering, succeeded by happy
                    repose." Mr. Lockridge accepts this view as stated by Robert Dale Owen and found in other
                    writings, and presents it in his own way, saying that, "it may be assumed that the
                    Labyrinth sumbolized their [I the Rappites'] belief in the early comings of the millenium.
                    It also typified their conception of the winding ways of life by which a state of true social
                    harmony was to be attained ultimately. It seems, furthermore, to have been regarded by them and by
                    those who visited them, as a pleasure ground. Thus, it integrated truly the harmony of those devout
                    people."
            The brochure is well written and represents much careful work. There are some slips such as
                    "divigation" for "divination" (p. 22), and the failure to
                    indicate an omission from a quotation (p. 77). Readers will certainly appreciate the many fine
                    things included in the pamphlet, perhaps the finest piece of writing that Mr. Lockridge has ever
                    done. The reviewer has enjoyed the study and recommends it to others.

            The Tools and Technique of Genealogical Research1
            
            JOSEPH C. WOLF
            
            I should like to begin my talk by quoting, with your permission, a rather insulting poem about our
                    interests and our profession. It is by John Kendrick Bangs, the American humorist, and it goes like
                    this: 
                        Whate'er my forebears may have been,
                        Ape, insect, bird, flesh, fowl, or fin,
                        I am myself; and rain or shine
                        Intend to fill the place that's mine.
                        Say what you will, prove what you can About the origin of man—
                        No line of monkey ancestry
                        Can make a monkey out of me!
                    
            
            Perhaps no line of monkey ancestry ever made a monkey out of Mr. Bangs, but I can tell you from my
                    own experience that ancestry, and particularly the search for it, has made monkeys out of a good
                    many people. Many a man has set out to trace his family history only to end up three or four years
                    later in a state of greater confusion than when he started. And many a woman has been driven to
                    distraction by the intricate inter-twinings of the branches of the family tree.
            My purpose in presenting this paper is to help some of you in the search for your ancestors by
                    pointing out to you a number of short cuts and a number of proven methods that some of you may not
                    now practice. I realize, of course, that many of you have had considerable experience in research,
                    and that a number of the things I am going to say have been heard by you and read by you time and
                    time again. Moreover, there are in existence a number of books dealing with my subject which cover
                    the ground much more thoroughly than I can in the space of an hour. One of them in particular,
                    Gilbert Doane's Searching for Your Ancestors,2 is an
                    admirable handbook for the genealogist, and I shall refer to it again and again. In the course of my
                    work in

                            , c. 1937).
               
                     the Genealogical Department of the Newberry Library, and through
                    association with some of the competent professional and amateur genealogists who regularly work
                    there, I have come upon some stray bits of information and some tricks of technique that may be new
                    to even the most experienced of you. Those of my audience who are old hands at genealogical research
                    will have to bear patiently with me during certain portions of my paper, for the bulk of it is
                    directed to the inexperienced amateur and to the comparative newcomer in the field.
            I do not know what started you on your interest in genealogy, but it was probably one of the half
                    dozen or so aims that prompt most people to look up their ancestors. These are, briefly: (1) To
                    satisfy a natural curiosity about the past and about the people who lived in the old days. (2) To
                    determine relationship to some historical person or to some member of the nobility. (3) To establish
                    claim to membership in the D.A.R., S.A.R., or some other patriotic society. (4) Or, finally, the aim
                    may be simply the fun connected with research—the pure joy of the search and interest in
                    the unusual things that are turned up.
            Most people pursue one or more of these aims with a grim seriousness that frequently threatens to
                    obscure their satisfaction when they finally do accomplish their end. Once in a while, however, I
                    come across a genealogist who thoroughly enjoys his hobby, even when the joke is on him. One of our
                    readers at Newberry, for example, became a member of the Mayflower Society through an ancestor who,
                    it turned out, was the first man hanged for murder in 
                        Plymouth
                    . The reader was not dismayed, and maintained his family pride even when he learned that
                    the murderer's son, Francis, was sent to jail for drinking (that is, smoking) tobacco on
                    the highway. At this point, however, the members of the family discarded their evil ways and from
                    then on became honorable citizens. A son of Francis moved to another part of 
                        Massachusetts
                     and founded the first church in that town. The amusing thing about the matter, the
                    reader informed me, is that many persons who could become members of the Mayflower Society through
                    this same ancestor have dropped everything upon discovering the hanging.
            But whatever your aim, and whatever the pleasure you take in following it, the procedure in general
                    is the same. I  am going to discuss, first, the equipment
                    necessary for genealogical research; then I shall talk about where to start, followed by an outline
                    of library research and general suggestions on research procedure. Throughout these remarks I shall
                    make frequent reference to various types of tools and their use. Some of the things I shall say are
                    very simple and obvious. I shall mention them, however, because I know from my experience at
                    Newberry that even people who have been working for years on their family history have not developed
                    standard systems of research and have not provided themselves with practical tools for their work.
            In starting out on genealogical research you must be aware of one important fact. It is this: that
                    before you finish with your search you are going to be the possessor of a huge heap of notes and
                    manuscripts and pictures and photostats and maps and strange little pencilled scraps of paper that
                    came from goodness knows where. It is vitally important, therefore, to start out with a definite
                    plan for arranging and filing this material as you gather it. This aspect of research seems to have
                    suffered great neglect at the hands of genealogists, although genealogical work requires just as
                    much care and intelligence as any other research subject. It is also important to remember that in
                    this kind of research you will find a great many apparently unrelated facts and items. An item here
                    and an item there may seem to have no connection, and yet a third item may link the three together.
                    Such a happy combination obviously would be impossible if, through bad organization, the first two
                    were not accessible when the third was found. Keep everything pertinent, therefore, and keep it in
                    findable form.
            Provide yourself with a loose-leaf notebook. One eight-and-a-half by eleven inches in size is
                    preferable because this size not only is convenient tG carry, but all your correspondence,
                    typewritten papers, photostats and other valuable notes and papers can be inserted and rearranged
                    with a minimum of trouble. Many genealogists also carry a smaller pocket size for jotting down notes
                    and information when traveling. I should like to say a word about that common combination, pencil
                    and paper. Pencil is all right for temporary notes, but eventually smudging will result in loss of
                    legibility or even in complete obliteration. Pen and ink make the ideal
                    combination—wherever,  of course, the library or
                    institution will permit their use.
            There are various patented devices for holding notes, or for preserving family records, which are
                    obtainable at book stores that specialize in genealogical publications. There are square charts, or
                    radial and fan-shaped charts, arranged so that the skeleton or even the entire compilation may be
                    seeii at a glance. The old-fashioned natural tree with its trunk, branches and twigs has in recent
                    years passed completely off the scene. The New 
                            England

               3 system of denoting relationship by figures,
                    paragraphing, and difference in type styles and sizes is the standard system used in printing
                    material.
            And now as to where to start your search.
            The place to start digging is right in your own back yard. Every family has records of some sort and
                    every home has a collection of such memoranda. They may he relics, old clippings, albums, old
                    letters, diaries, official documents of one sort or another, journals, and even samplers. And last
                    but not least, of course, is that most widely used storehouse of documents and data—the
                    old family Bible. Many a letter or paper too valuable to be trusted to the doubtful security of a
                    bank vault has been slipped between the leaves of the old family Bible. And more often than not, the
                    Bible has proved to be a safe resting place. If you are fortunate, and if your ancestors were given
                    to filing letters and clippings and other information in the Bible, you may find a good deal of
                    useful information in the family copy. The chances are even better that you will find written
                    therein the births and deaths of at least one or two generations.
            In telling you how to use this information I can do no better than quote from Searching
                        for Your Ancestors. Mr. Doane says: "One of the first things to do when examining
                    a Bible is to determine when the book was printed. If the title page has the date 1817 on it, or the
                    preface or translator's note is signed 1817, you know at once that any records dated before
                    that year were entered from memory (or, perhaps, copied from some older Bible). In this event those
                    records should be carefully verified, if possible, from other sources—gravestones, town
                    or church records."4 I should

                     also like to make this suggestion: because essential
                    genealogical information is often contained in family Bibles it is important to insure against their
                    loss and destruction. This can be done by photostating the title page and all pertinent genealogical
                    data and giving copies to several close relatives. Incidentally, and while I am on this subject, it
                    is always prudent and frequently helpful to mark all family portraits and pictures in such a way
                    that future generations will be able to identify them.
            After the family documents have been examined, thc next step is to ransack the minds of the various
                    members of the family. Many elderly people have a very clear memory of things that they heard or saw
                    when they were younger, and such information can be of great value. It should be remembered,
                    however—and this point cannot be overemphasized—that all such information must
                    be checked and verified in every possible way before it is accepted as factual. It is better to
                    regard the statements of relatives and old settlers as valuable hints and clues toward further
                    research rather than as reliable history.
            When you have gathered all the information that the family Bible and the family memory have to offer;
                    when you have equipped yourself with all the names aid dates and places that you possibly can get;
                    then, and not until then, are you ready to go to the library to begin your research in books.
            But before I talk about search in books, I should like to make five suggestions of a general nature:
                    (1) In tracing your ancestors always proceed from the present to the past. It is the easiest way
                    because more is known about present and recent generations than about the earlier ones; and it is
                    the best way because it minimizes the danger of getting off on a branch line. (2) Make a note of
                    every book you search in—especially if you find nothing in it. You may
                    spend a day or even two days in going through book after book without finding a single reference to
                    your family, and you may feel that you have wasted completely those two days. But your activity was
                    not wasted. Such activity may be called "negative research." That is, you did not
                    find what you were looking for, but you do know that what you are looking for is not in the fifty or
                    sixty books you consulted in those two days. If you have listed their titles (preferably  on small cards alphabetically arranged by author), you will have a
                    "works consulted" file which will tell you instantly what works you have already
                    examined. It is a system that will save much duplication of effort. (3) In reading old records and
                    documents it is important to remember that with the passage of time the meanings of words change.
                    For example, in early records the term "cousin" did not necessarily imply blood
                    relationship, and "brother" could mean a brother-in-Christ or a brother-in-law as
                    well as the closer tie. "Son-in-law" occasionally meant step-son, and there are
                    other similar traps for the unwary. (4) Every name is important, no matter where you find it. The
                    ordinary man whose chief aim in life was to be an honorable citizen and a prompt taxpayer may be a
                    very elusive person. His record may be found anywhere. He may be mentioned in a local history or he
                    may be mentioned in a medical or business directory or some other special compilation that has no
                    direct connection with family history or the science of genealogy. There is no rule limiting the
                    bibliography of genealogy. A name may be found anywhere—and you must look for it there!
                    (5) Finally, do not be discouraged if you fail to compile your genealogy in a few hours. Sometimes a
                    few hours' work will show great results, but frequently days, weeks or months will pass
                    with very little accomplished.
            With these hints and suggestions in mind you are ready to begin work in a library.
            It is advisable, on your first visit to a library that you have not used before, to go to the person
                    in charge of the genealogical department and ask him or her to acquaint you with any special indexes
                    they may have compiled, and with the general routine in that particular library. Most libraries have
                    developed catalogues or guides to certain of their collections; they are designed to save time and
                    effort for the reader, and intelligent use will result in just that saving. At Newberry, for
                    example, most genealogists begin their search in the celebrated analytical index. It is a guide to
                    the family names in the books to be found in the Library, and it contains over a million entries,
                    alphabetically arranged by name and then by state and county under each name.
            You are now ready to explore the vast domain of published works. If you are fortunate, you will find
                    that an already-published genealogy includes your branch of the family.  You probably will not be fortunate, so your next step will be to
                    examine periodicals which include genealogies and notes on family history. The best available guide
                    to this source is Jacobus' Index to Genealogical Periodicals.5 This tool indexes such periodicals as the New 
                            England
                         Register and the 
                  
                            New York
                         Genealogical and Biographical Record,6 two old standbys in
                    this field. They contain, in addition tn genealogies, such items as transcripts and abstracts of
                    local records, probate records, church records, and cemetery records. There also are numerous
                    periodicals covering other sections of the country, such as the William and Mary
                        Quayterly
               7 for 
                        Virginia
                    , and the publications of the Genealogical Society of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . There are other important indexes. such as Durrie and Munsell,8 but I shall not discuss them here. Instead, I shall refer you once again to
                    Mr. Doane's book where, in Appendix A, you will find a comprehensive list of indexes.
            When you have exhausted the periodicals as a source of material, the next thing to do is to locate a
                    history of the town or county in which you know your ancestor lived. In general histories there are
                    only very brief mentions of individuals—enough, however, to establish the genealogical
                    identity. In local histories material will range from brief mentions of individuals to short
                    accounts of their families. It is not uncommon to find two or three generations in an article. Such
                    sketches are intended to show the connection of the individual or the family with the community.
            There are a few bibliographies of local history, but nothing, to my knowledge, that is comprehensive
                    or up-to-date. 
                        Hammond
                     compiled one for 
                        New Hampshire
                     towns and Flagg produced a similar one for 
                        Massachusetts
                    . Another very useful list is the catalogue of genealogies and local histories published
                    in 1936 by Goodspeed's Book Shop in 
                        Boston
                    .9 This, incidentally, is a useful tool for small genealogical
                    libraries.

                     another word of warning is in order. For various reasons many
                    towns have changed their names at one time or another, and many state and county lines have been
                    shifted. Frequently two or three new counties have been formed out of one large county, with a
                    subsequent adjustment of lines all around. Stetson10 gives an interesting
                    account which will serve as an example of the type of difficulty created for the genealogist by such
                    boundary changes.
            "John Joles was supposed to have been born, to have lived and to have died in 
                        Warren
                    , 
                        Rhode Island
                    . It was found by the record that he died in Bristol, 
                        Rhode Island
                    , an adjoining town. This record greatly disturbed some of his descendants who appealed
                    for help to establish the facts in the case. It was found that the old 
                        Warren
                    -Bristol line passed directly through the Joles house which stood not ovelhalf a mile
                    south from the center of 
                        Warren
                     village, and that the family bedroom where John slept was on the Bristol side of the
                    line. The town line was later moved south one mile, leaving the entire house a mile on the 
                        Warren
                     side. At the time John died, however, if he died in his bed, he was in Bristol. But if
                    he ate in the old-fashioned kitchen, a custom prevailing in the early days, he ate in 
                        Warren
                    . Therefore he doubtless was born and died in Bristol, but lived in 
                        Warren
                     all his life, and actually was born, always lived in, and died in the same house and
                    adjoining rooms."
            Nor are such changes a problem of the past. Just a year or so ago I came across this item in one of
                    the 
                        Chicago
                     newspapers. It was date-lined Havana, 
                        Alabama
                    , and read: "J. W. Whatley of Havana has lived in 
                        Greene
                    , 
                        Tuscaloosa
                    , and Hale counties, but has not moved in 72 years. The county boundary lines did the
                    moving." When, therefore, the searcher works through the history and records of a county
                    without finding mention of his ancestor, he will do well to check on the history of the boundary
                    lines. He may find his materials in the seat of the next county a few miles away.
            Another valuable source of information is the 1790 census, known as the first census of the 
                        United States
                    . It was taken in 1790 and 1791 and was printed by the Bureau nf Census in 1905. Through
                    it you may be enabled to locate an ancestor in a particular town or county. It is not my intention,
                    however, to enter into a long discussion about the

                     availability and usefulness of census records. Once again I
                    shall refer you to Doane's excellent treatment of this subject.
            Other valuable assistance from the government may come through such material as land records and
                    pension records.
            State records are important and can be found in the office of the secretary of state of our older
                    states. They are usually available for personal inspection. They furnish material of great value and
                    should be examined. Many states have printed these records and sets can be found in most libraries.
                    They contain such information as petitions, affidavits, records of special court cases, commissions,
                    bills of lading and commercial papers, military rosters and reports, surveys, and so on. Other
                    valuable printed sources not to be overlooked are the collections of wills and deeds. These have
                    been printed by various societies and individuals and include such titles as:

            Other records found in genealogical libraries and in public libraries having genealogical sections
                    include copies of official records such as birth, marriage and death certificates. As you progress
                    there will be the customary treatment of various points. Missing records of birth will be sought in
                    the proper locality, and the same treatment will be accorded death and marriage records. If the
                    vital records of the town were not kept at an early date, or if they were destroyed, the next source
                    would be any available church records. These frequently contain the records of baptisms, marriages
                    and deaths. Sometimes they contain a little additional information which would not be found with the
                    official record of the event as given by the town clerk. For example, you may find the names of
                    godfathers, of witnesses, or of other members of the family.
            
            Other valuable tools are the patriotic society lineag: books. They not only list the member of the
                    society, but also give an outline of the ancestry required. The interveiling generations, with their
                    possible changes of surname and the connection between families, are useful for ready reference.
            All of this, of course, is an illustration of what I have said before: There is no limit to the
                    bibliography of gelealogy. Every book which contains the desired name should be used for compiling a
                    history of that family. The choice of books depends largely on the activities of the members of the
                    family. A minister might be found in such works as the Annals of the American
                        Pulpit,11 and a soldier, in the army records or the pension records.
                    Then, too, there are innumerable resources for discovering proofs of identity, or relationship
                    lineal or collateral, and no one book can tell you how to work. Rather than attempt to give you a
                    lengthy bibliography of genealogy, I will call your attention once more to Mr. Doane and his list of
                    bibliographies that serve as a guide to the most-used books in each field.
            There is, of course, much work to be done outside of libraries. This consists largely of writing to
                    others for information and help, and very frequently such correspondence is the only way to get
                    absolutely necessary information. Again I feel that I should apologize for elaborating on such a
                    simple point, but I have seen so many rudely-written letters, and so many justifiably sharp replies,
                    that a word of suggestion may be helpful. Always introduce yourself at the beginning of your letter.
                    Then state your problem briefly and clearly and follow that statement with a series of direct
                    questions. If possible, arrange these questions in some logical order so that the person questioned
                    will be able to see something of the point of your inquiry. In other words, make your letter
                    interesting, and keep in mind that not all people are interested in genealogy, and that genealogical
                    problems, particularly those of a stranger, do not seem important to them. You will, of course,
                    enclose return postage, or a stamped, self-addressed envelope. When writing to town or county clerks
                    for vital records, probate records, land records, or tax lists, offer to pay any fee they may charge
                    and enclose a stamped, self-addressed envelope for reply.
            
               
                  11 William B. Sprague, Annals of the American Pulpit (9
                        vols., 
                            New York
                        , 1857–1869).
            
            
            At this point Doane again comes to the rescue of ancestor hunters. For your convenience he has listed
                    the states which have collected in a state office the vital records from the several towns and
                    counties. A more complete list, and the one from which Mr. Doane compiled his, was printed in an
                    article in the New 
                            England
                         Register.12 Harold Clarke Durrell, the author of the
                    article, gives very full information about the activities of the offices in all forty-eight states,
                    so his paper should also be consulted on such problems.
            There is one more extra-library activity to be mentioned. When all other records have failed to
                    produce information. you will have to start digging in cemeteries-figuratively, not literally. The
                    dates and inscriptions on tombstones arc your records here, and they frequently are very valuable
                    ones. It should be remembered that in most old settlements it was as much a custom to have private
                    burial plots on the farms as to have church or town graveyards. In many cases these private burial
                    places antedate the public ones. Hence a thorough search must be made of all such possible places.
                    If you fail in one place, search the cemeteries in neighboring communities. Tombstones, of course,
                    are not always helpful. Imagine the feelings of the earnest seeker after information who came across
                    this inscription: "I was somebody. Who, is no business of yours." And some of them
                    are obviously unreliable, as, for example, the one that reads: "Here lies Johr: Mound, Who
                    was lost at sea and never found."
            I am sure that by this time you are thoroughly bored with the tools of genealogical research, and
                    probably will not want to hear another title for a week. I should like to mention just one more type
                    of tool, and then I shall have finished. That tool is the newspaper index, and, I am happy to say,
                    we are getting more and more of them. Those already in existence are Palmer's Index to the [
                            London
                        ] Times Newspaper which runs from 1790 to date, the 
                  
                            New York
                         Times Index, 1913 to date, the 
                  
                            New York
                         Daily Tribune Index, 1875 to 1906, and the Index to the 
                            Burlington
                         [
                            Vermont
                        ] Free Press from 1848–1868. This last index is a new tool, just
                    produced by WPA workers, and it should be of considerable help to persons working in Vermont family
                    history. Apparently, too, we are going to have other indexes of this kind. 
                        Chicago
                     papers, for example, are being indexed from 
                  
                     12
                            New 
                                    England
                                 Register, XC (1936), 9–31.
               
                     1833 to 1936, and it is to be hoped that some day the index
                    will be published. These newspaper indexes are to be found only in the larger libraries, but there
                    is always a chance that they will contain a reference to an obituary notice or some other item
                    relating to your ancestor, and they may well be consulted whenever you happen to be working in an
                    institution which has them.
            So much for the tools of the trade. Before concluding, I should like to say a few more words on
                    technique. Remember that nothing can be done toward establishing the earlier families until the more
                    recent ones have been found. The local sources are nearly always productive and will supply many
                    clues. If your ancestor lived in one place and theu moved to another, the proper procedure would be
                    to search the records in the latter place from birth records to warrants for land. This may
                    establish the activities of the family over a certain period, may determine the duration of
                    residence at that place, and may also give suggestions as to former residence. In earlier days the
                    record of the first purchase of land by a person made mention of his former residence. Because of
                    this fact it is occasionally possible to trace the wanderings of a family for quite a few years.
            The place of maps in genealogical research should be mentioned. Old maps are far more helpful than
                    modern maps, since they show the geographical condition as it actually was at the time your family
                    lived in the territory. Use state, county, and town maps, and topographical and rural delivery maps.
                    If they are too large they can be folded and inserted in your loose-leaf book. No serious search
                    should be attempted unless a good map is available.
            An analysis of the 1790 census, called A century of population growth from the first
                        census of the 
                            United States
                         to the Twelfth, 1790–1900
               13 contains a series
                    of maps showing the development of the country from 1790 to 1900, and indicates the boundary lines
                    of the various counties and the changes which have taken place in them from time to time. This
                    volume also includes a list of names taken from the 1790 schedules showing what spellings were used
                    for each name in the different schedules.
            And here is what I think is one of the most helpful of all devices. When you have exhausted all other
                    means and 
                  
                     13 This was published in 
                                Washington
                             in 1909.
               
                     methods of research, and you do not know where to turn next,
                    make what is known as a "circular search." Get a map of the pertinent territory
                    and, using the earliest known residence of your ancestor as the center, draw, with a compass, a
                    circle at a radius of about five miles. Then search all the sources in all the towns included in
                    this area. If this fails to produce information, extend the radius another five miles and again go
                    through the records of every town. This may be continued indefinitely, and it very
                    seldom fails.
            Finally, may I urge one more point? May I make a plea for accuracy? You must verify
                    every note, every reference, every scrap of information you get. The fact that a date is in a book,
                    and that the book is in a famous library, does not mean that the date is a reliable one. I cannot
                    emphasize this point too strongly, for on it hinges the reputation of your research and of all
                    genealogical research. Remember the last words of the dying scholar as his pupils gathered at his
                    bedside: "Check your references!"
