                    <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. There is a new Senator present, I believe - from

                    <p>Mr. THOMAS REAGAN, then came forward to the Secretary's desk, presented

                        Milton Peden, who forfeited his seat in said Senate by accepting a
                        commission in the service of the United States," and was qualified by
                        taking the oath at the hands of the President of the Senate.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CASON. As there are several Senators absent, and as it would be
                            satisfactory to have them all present. I move that the resolution lie
                            upon the table till to-morrow morning at nine o'clock.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. Before any Doorkeeper, or other officers of the Senate are
                            electedso that thay may not consider it a personal matter, I beg leave
                            to introduce the following resolution:</p>
                        <floatingText>
                            <body>

                                    <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That the President of the Senate
                                        appoint a committee of three Senators whose duty it shall be
                                        to superintend the employment of all assistants to the
                                        officers of the Senate; and that no person shall be allowed
                                        to draw pay for services as such assistant, unless his
                                        employment is authorized by such committee.</p>
                                </div>
                            </body>
                        </floatingText>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. I am opposed to that resolution. I don't think it a proper
                            one. I think that no three Senators ought to be invested with the power
                            to control the action of this Senate in relation to the appointment of
                            their employees I presume if we select such officers as will properly do
                            their duties, there will be no occasion, and it seems to me out of
                            place, to appoint a supervisory committee over their actions. I have
                            never known anything of the kind here; and it seems to me the resolution
                            ought not to pass. For these reasons I move to lay the resolution on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. I hope the Senator will not move to lay the resolution on
                            the table until I have time to make an explanation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. I will withdraw the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. If I were to introduce this resolution after the election of
                            Doorkeepers and Clerks, they would have some cause to say it was a
                            personal matter; but I introduce it now, so that they can accept their
                            offices with the understanding that this Senate will control the
                            appointment of their assistants. At the last term, as we see by an
                            official publication in today's paper, there were some thirty or
                            forty clerks and a larger number of doorkeepers and assistants - almost
                            two employees to every Senator upon this floor. And other clerks and
                            doorkeepers may do the same. I don't know who will be elected, but
                            by this resolution a committee is to control the appointments. It is to
                            let the clerks and doorkeepers select their assistants, who will apply
                            to that committee to see whether they are needed; if so, then the
                            officer appoints whom he pleases. I don't desire that the committee
                            shall say who he shall appoint, but I desire it to say how many are
                            needed. At the last session we had nearly two employes to every Senator,
                            and the country holds us responsible for these expenses. I introduced a
                            resolution at the close of the session on this subject, and I thought
                            then, as I believe now, that hundreds of dollars were stolen. I felt
                            indignant, but it was too late. We let it go till the last day of the
                            session, and we had to let the proceedings sleep. I want to stop these
                            things at the start, I want to guard every avenue to the public
                            treasury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. I want to inquire whether or not this resolution controls the
                            appointments by this committee of the employes urder the officers
                            elected by the Senate? From the language of the resolution I understood
                            that it does.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. The resolution says "to superintend." I don't
                            think the language susceptible of being misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. With the Senator from Lawrence, [Mr. Cobb] I don't like
                            the wording of the resolution. I move to strike out the word
                            "superintend" and insert the word "confirm."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. I accept the amendment.</p>
                        <p>[A message from the House announced the organization of that body.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. At the commencement of the last session I introduced a
                            resolution fixing the pay of officers by the session. I now move to
                            strike out from the resolving clause and insert the following:</p>
                        <p>That the Senate will elect a Principal Secretary, whose salary for this

                            Dookeeper, whose salary for this session shall be one thousad dollars,

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. I believe there is a law now, passed among the acts of the
                            last Legislature, stating what officers we shall have and what salaries
                            they shall receive, and is it proposed to do away with that law by this
                            resolution?</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. I answer by saying that we have done that every session since
                            the adoption of the Constitution. The law says the officers shall
                            receive four dollars a day, while every sesion they have been paid from
                            four to five dollars per day.</p>

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. In 1861 at the extra session that followed the regular one,
                            as does in the Senate here, the principal Secretary was; appointed to a
                            Government position, and the others vacated their places, and we filled
                            them by our action. The President of the Senate held his place, however;
                            and that session was continued as though it was the same session with
                            the regular one that preceded it. What was the action in the other
                            House? They seemed to think that the officers held over for two years,
                            but inconsequence of the condition of the country, they tendered their
                            resignations, and a portion was re-elected, and a portion was not. They
                            took it that their organization in January should continue so Iong as
                            the members supposed themselves entitled to seats upon the floor; just
                            as I consider we have the right here till the second Tuesday in October,
                            1866, and that the organization effected last January has the right to
                            continue. If any here are objactable, we have probably the right to
                            remove them, but we have no right to say these gentlemen shall be thrown
                            out of their places.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. I acknowledge that the Senator from Knox [Mr. Williams,] has
                            far more legislative experience than I, but I have yet to learn that the
                            action of the House in the other end of this Capitol ought to have any
                            controlling influence over the Senate. As a precedent it may have some
                            force, yet to me it has but little. As has been remarked at the last
                            session, we had some 73 appointees, and the moment we indorse the
                            appointment of one we indorse the appointment of the whole 73. And I say
                            we don't need them. If we sustain the appointment of these 73 men
                            we don't do our duty to the State of Indiana. I am loth to say that
                            I was placed in a position to indorse them last session, but I am not
                            disposed to repeat it now.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. In this newspaper business we usually get about three times
                            as many papers as necessary, and we ought to specify in our resolution
                            who they are to go to. The reason I propose to rescind the contract is
                            this: the editors, finding it a heavy expense to keep up their reports,
                            in a few days begin to drop off and curtail them. At the middle of last
                            session there was a resolution introduced to drop the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> because of its meagre reports. I voted against that
                            resolution, because it might be supposed I voted upon political grounds
                            had cast my vote for it. But it did not publish the proceedings of this
                            Senate as we desired. A few sessions ago it was the reverse - the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> gave good reports and the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> comparitively none. In the session of 1859, the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> had no reports at all scarcely, and the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> at that time had full reports. I do not think
                            these papers are of any use to us or our constituents, unless they
                            contain full reports of what we are doing. I am opposed to taking every
                            paper in Indianapolis for fear they will get mad at us. We might as well
                            take the paper from Union county. We are not to hunt up the <hi rend="i">Volksblatt</hi> or any other blat. We want just such papers as will
                            print our proceedings in full, but as the Senate is composed of two
                            political parties, as a matter of jusitice, and for the sake of harmony,
                            I say divide this, and seIect one Democratic and one Republican paper.
                                <pb n="12" xml:id="VAA8558-08-012"/>If they do not publish the full
                            proceedings - just such as the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> published last
                            session, and the <hi rend="i">Sentinels</hi> few years ago - I am for
                            rescinding the contract. I am not voting for a resolution to take these
                            papers to accommodate the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> or the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, but because we need them, and our constituents are
                            willing to pay for them, if they furnish ample reports. If they are
                            willing to give full reports, I am willing to pay them for it. No paper
                            can afford to publish the full proceedings of this Senate unless we
                            patronize them liberally. Then I am willing to take three copies each,
                            for I believe in addition to the general interest they give to their
                            circulation, that will pay them. I am willing to go far enough for that,
                            and then I want to stop. I am opposed to putting in the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi>, <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> or any other paper, for
                            they do not employ reporters here, and if they did, we do not need their
                            papers. I do not care whether they abuse me for it, or anybody else. We
                            have a right to do as we please. If these papers do not comply with
                            their contract, the finance committee can report adverse to paying for
                            them. I have seen too much swindling about this thing, and I have got
                            tired of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GULLEN. This is rather a substitute than an amendment to my
                            resolution, which proposes to take three copies for each Senator. By
                            mathematical calculation you can see how many papers that will be. I
                            suppose if the Doorkeeper contracts for more, he will be responsible,
                            and not the Senate. I do not know how my friends' constituents are,
                            but mine are reading people, and I have been solicited by this and that,
                            man on my way to the Capital to drop them a paper occasionally, that
                            they might see what is going on, and I have invariably said I would do
                            so. There seems to be a disposition on the part of some men to strain
                            out a goat and swallow a camel. I hold that the Senate has no right in
                            justice to say that they will take the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>, and leave the others out, I know as a matter
                            of fact the Evening <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> was about as important a
                            paper to Senators as any other, and the proceedings of the Legislature
                            was published about as complete as it was in either of the other papers.
                            That in my recollection of the matter. This is a trifling expense, and
                            if we take any paper let us take them all. The reason the other papers
                            do not publish our proceedings is that the Senate and House of
                            Representatives are continually bestowing their favors and patronage
                            upon their pets. Now, I propose to place these papers upon an equality
                            and give them all a fair show, and give to our German constituents, of
                            which I have a fair quantity, papers to read in their own language. Our
                            people are desirous of understanding what is going on here, and if they
                            can get a paper from us they take it as a great kindness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA. I am informed that the <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> has a
                            reporter upon this floor and upon the floor of the other House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. Then I say let us give these papers a fair show.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON. I am in favor of the resolution offered by the Senator from
                            Rush, [Mr. Cullen.] The German population in this State now, almost
                            constitute one-third of the voters, and it is an important matter that
                            this Senate should show a kindly disposition toward this people. Our
                            Governor has mada a long address and circulated it in Germany, and many
                            of them are coming to this country, and how important it is that this
                            Senate should encourage them to come and to read in their own language
                            the doings of the State Legislature. I am willing to take the
                            responsibility. If we could send a paper to every family in the State I
                            would be glad of it, and should esteem ourselves a head and shoulders
                            above every other State in the Union.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN the amendment was laid on the table - yeas 25,

                        <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells moved to amend, by way of substitute, as follows:</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells. I do not think any member should hesitate to vote for
                            this resolution. I presume all of us have German constituents who want
                            to read the doings of the Legislature. As to the other papers, they have
                            come to be a necessity, and so long as they report our proceedings, I
                            think it nothing more than due to them that we should subscribe for
                            these papers. I think the resolution occupies medium ground, and ought
                            to satisfy the friends of both measures.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN - yeas 22, nays 20 - the amendment was laid on
                            the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. It may be well enough to guard my resolution by saying that
                            the papers shall be furnished at the regular rates to subscribers.</p>
                        <p>There being no objection, the resolution was so amended.Mr. BENNETT moved
                            to strike out of the resolution the names of all the papers except the
                                <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> and <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, I hope the amendment will be adopted. We have a large German
                            population intelligent enough to have learned the English language, and
                            most of them can read the English newspapers, and do not resort to the
                            German newspapers to get the news of the day. That being the case, as
                            far as the German papers are concerned, there is no necessity for taking
                            them. We need some newspaper for the purpose of presenting us with the
                            news of the day; and we want to know what the organs of both parties say
                            in regard to legislative matters. They are supposed to reflect the
                            desires and sentiments of their respective parties, and these papers
                            ought to be taken I think, not because we want to accommodate the
                            publishers, and not particularly because we want to send these papers to
                            the people to be read, for I submit whether any Senator can send enough
                            papers to do good in any of these counties. It is a great humbug. What
                            do three newspapers a day amount to? If any gentleman wants to keep
                            posted concerning our action here, he will take a daily purpose for the
                            purpose of informing himself. I <pb n="13" xml:id="VAA8558-08-013"/>
                            have got thirty or forty dollars in my pocket that have been sent up by
                            my constituents to send them papers from here. I hope this amendment
                            will be adopted. I see a disposition among Senators to curtail expenses,
                            and if there ever was a time, now is the time to retrench. We have a
                            debt of enormous proportions which must be adjusted soon, and four or
                            five or six hundred dollars will help do it, and we ought to bring our
                            legislation down within the limits of necessity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND. I fully indorse the remarks of the gentleman from Lawrence
                            [Mr. Cobb] upon this question. I think this Senate should take two of
                            these papers, and no more. As a general thing the papers I have sent my
                            constituents have never reached them. This taking of five or six papers
                            here is paying for that which will accomplish no good, and therefore, I
                            am in hopes that the motion of the Senator from Union [Mr. Bennett] will
                            prevail.</p>
                        <p>The motion to strike out was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 16.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to postpone any farther consideration of this subject
                            till Wednesday, 3 o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. This is a short session, and I hope we will settle this
                            question right off, far we need these papers to-morrow. It is a thing no
                            man need think aboutit has been discussed for the past one hundred
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON. I hope the Senate will let this matter lay over until
                            Wednesday, and I think when they look over the ground, they, will see
                            the propriety of taking the <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi>. If the Senate is
                            determined to give the industrious Germans of the State the cold
                            shoulder, I would like them to consider it until Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the motion to postpone was laid on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>The resolution as amended was adopted - yeas 26, nays 15.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. At the last session, the Senator from Laporte, [Mr. NILES,] a
                            gentleman in whom we all have implicit; confidence, (I may say in his
                            absence,) made a report from a committee who investigated this subject,
                            and it seems to me another report is unnecessary. The report of last
                            session covered a mode of furnishing money for getting paper, which I am
                            decidedly favorable to, and I consider this resolution not at all
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MASON. I simply want to get some basis to act upon. It is true that
                            there was some mode prescribed in the committee's report at the
                            other term; but if this committee does not report in a way to suit the
                            Senate, some member can move to strike out and insert something else.
                            The report last session provided $100 for each member, but it is very
                            different now, as our daily wages are $5 instead of $3.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. I cannot see how swindling can grow out of that. The
                            librarian has on hand quite an amount of stationery which ought to be
                            issued in this way, and we hold him responsible.</p>

                        <p>Mr. OYLER. I think the Senate should not adopt that amendment. The
                            active, energetic members are the men who use the stationery, and there
                            are members on this floor who will need more than $15 worth. According
                            to the resolution the order of each one will be filled by the Librarian,
                            and his works will show whether he has used what he has drawn for his
                            own purposes or for the State. It may be enough for some, and enough for
                            me, I have no doubt, but others it wiil not supply.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the resolution and amendments were
                            referred to a select committee of three, with instruction to report
                            to-morrow.</p>
                        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR made the committee to consist of Messrs. Brown,
                            of Wells, Mason and Oyler.</p>
                        <p>And then the Senate adjourned till 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</p>

                                        he be recognized as such.</p>

                        <p>The resolution was agreed to without a division.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS. Though probaby a little late, desired to have the yeas and
                            nays, on the adoption of the resolution. The time may come when we might
                            want to get out of it.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The yeas and nays can be ordered by unanimous consent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. I supposed when the Clerk was directed to inform the Senate
                            of the organization, that the fact stated in the resolution was fully
                            recognized.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN saw no necessity for the adoption of the resolution. He thought
                            it an established fact that the election of Speaker was for the term of
                            office of Representatives, and not for one session only; that the
                            organization of the body was for the term and not for the session. Such
                            was the practice in the Congress of the United States as well as in this
                            State. The Speaker was elected to serve during the entire term for which
                            the people elected him. We all know that there are two sessions for
                            every Congress, and that the Speaker is elected to serve during the term
                            for which the members of that body are elected. When Congress meets for
                            the second session, the same organization holds; and if the President
                            convenes an estra session, the organization had at the first session
                            still holds good. The gentleman need have no fear of Democratic members
                            here in that matter. I say to him that we have considered this thing,
                            and intend to stand by it, because we believe that the doctrine is
                            justified by all parliamentary history that these officers elected at
                            the last session are still the legal officers of the House, and are the
                            only persons that can exercise their functions, unless the House for
                            good cause shall remove them, or any one of them. I think, therefore,
                            that the resolution of the gentleman from Marion is a useless one. He
                            showed, further, that the Republican House in the Legislature of 1861
                            established the precedent for which he contended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB had considered the past history of the body, and thought that
                            perhaps some such expression of the House ought to go to record. In the
                            session of 1858 the Speaker was elected at the special sessionthe
                            special session coming first, and at the regular session in tbe January
                            following, the question was raised whether the Speaker could hold, and
                            after considerable discussion the debate was cut short by the Speaker
                            and officers resigning, and their re-election. In 1861 the Speaker
                            announced that he would not take the Chair, and as soon as the roll was
                            called he tendered his resignation and was re-elected. I think myself
                            that the Speaker is entitled to hold during the term; and to show that
                            the House recognizes the rule it is proper that the resolution should go
                            to record. That is my only object in offering it.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER The Chair hears no objection to the order of the yeas and
                            nays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN desired to amend the resolution by inserting with that of the
                            Speaker the names of all the officers of the House.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from Jackson send it up in writing?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. With the consent of the House I will withdraw the
                            resolution, and submit the following:</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the resolution would not be adopted, and insisted that
                            the continuance of the organization of the House carries with it the
                            rules of the last session. The rules at the last session were the rules
                            at this time, and if they needed amendment it must be done as at the
                            last session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. I desire to ask the gentleman whether we have not the power
                            to revise the rules?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN Most certainly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. That is precisely what we are about to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. If I understand the resolution, it is such a one as is always
                            offered upon the organisation of a new House. It proceeds upon the
                            doctrine that there is now no rules whatever for the government of this
                            House, else why does it propose to have the rules of the last session
                            continued in force till we shall establish original rules at this
                            session for our government? I think that this is the spirit of the
                            resolutions, and that it is wrong for the reasons I have given.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. But I desire a revision of the Rules. It will be recollected
                            that thera were a great many amendments to the rules made as the last
                            session - so many that no member can now readily tell what they are. If
                            the latter clause is objectionable to the gentleman, I am willing to
                            strike it out, and retain only the part which proposes to revise the
                            rules.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD. Would not that carry with it a necessity for reprinting the
                            rules? These frequent revisions of the rules do us no good. They were
                            generally no better after a revision than before, and in his judgment,
                            not so good. And if there were still on hand a sufficient <pb n="16" xml:id="VAA8558-08-016"/> number of the old rules, be was opposed to
                            the resolution.The resolution was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved an order, that 200 copies of tbe Rules of this House be
                            printed and placed on the desks of members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD still urged the same objection as before; but, if he could know
                            there were not on hand a sufficient number of copies, he would favor the
                            motion of the gentleman from Jackson.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. There were none at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. Mr. Speaker, I demanded a division of the House just now,
                            but was not recognized by the Chair. I think this printing the Rules,
                            and then revising them afterwards is an absurdity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, if in error about the matter of revieioD, would not insist. He
                            understood that the question of revision was decided in tho rejection of
                            the resolution of the gentleman from Laporte. His inference was that the
                            House does not want the rules revised. Then the next question is to get
                            these rules here so that gentlemen may know what they are. He would say
                            to the gentleman from Lawrence, that he had sent to the Librarian, and
                            he pays he has not got them. He did not think fifty copies could be
                            obtained in the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS. The gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Kilgore ] demanded a
                            division of the House on the adoption of the resolution of the gentleman
                            from Laporte [Mr. Higgins.]</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. If there is no objection the Chair will go back to that. The
                            Chair hears none. As many as are in favor of the adoption of the
                            resolution of the gentleman from Laporte, will please to rise and stand
                            till they are counted.</p>
                        <p>The vote on the division of the House then resulted - affirmative 42,
                            negative 30.</p>
                        <p>So the resolution was adopted.</p>

                            wants to get rid of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. I desire to amend the resolution so as to include the Senate
                            Journal.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>And then the resolution, as amended, was adopted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. LANE. In all due courtesy to the gentleman, I move to lay that on the
                            table. There are a great many new members of the House not yet assigned
                            to act on any committee. He withdrew the motion for explanation.</p>
                        <p>Mr, GRIFFITH. It is but carrying out the programme we have initiated. We
                            have adopted a resolution recognizing the officers of the former session
                            as the officers of this, and should we not recognice the committees? But
                            I am willing it should go to the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I think it well enough to lay it on the table. My
                            understanding is, that we continue over and remain so far as officers
                            and committees are concerned, precisely as we stood in the former
                            session. I take that for granted. It is suggested that there are some
                            gentlemen who are on no committee. Such can be assigned by the Speaker.
                            I presume we understand ourselves as proceeding upon the principle that
                            everything stands as at the last session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH withdrew the resolution.</p>

                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to lay it on the table. But withdrawing for explanation
                            - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD simply desired to say that he had seen a similar publication
                            with reference to these expenses for the last session of the Senate in
                            the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of to-day, and thought it was due to
                            members of the House to lay alongside of that statement the similar
                            expenses incurred by the House. For one, he would not be ashamed of any
                            statement of expenses that has thus accrued in the House, or that
                            attached to any committee with which he had been connected. And it was
                            due to our constituents that this publication sbould be made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. Is the resolution simply to have the statement published in
                            the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD Simply to have it published.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. At the expense of the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD. So far as that is concerned, I presume the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> company will not charge anything.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THACHER. I move to amend so as to require the statement to be
                            published also in the <hi rend="i">Daily Herald</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Does it ask that the report be made to the House?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD. No. He is to send the statement to the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr NEWCOMB. I think we had better direct the Auditor to report to this
                            House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD supposed the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> would not object to the
                            publishing.</p>
                        <p>Mr NEWCOMB. Of course not. I move to amend so that the Auditor shall
                            report to this House,</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. It occurs to me, we shall incur unnecessary expense by
                            authorizing this report to be printed. As my friend from Lawrence seems
                            to be very tenacious on the question of expenses, I think he had better
                            withdraw his resolution. If we authorize this printing by resolution,
                            these gentlemen of tho Journal Company will be sure to charge for it. My
                            word for that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON considered that the question as to whether the printicg is
                            to be had, ought to be decided after the report is made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THACHER withdrew his amendment.</p>
                        <p>The resolution as modified by Mr. Newcomb was then adopted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. We perhaps had a majority here yesterday, and we readily
                            granted this request of the gentlemen on the other side, and the matter
                            was postponed. Now the gentlemen's party is full in the Senate, and
                            they are anxious to take the matter up.</p>
                        <p>Now we ask that this same right shall be extended to us, that we may have
                            an opportunity of having our full force here; and we find these
                            gentlemen moving to lay our propositions on the table. I think it would
                            be acting in bad faith to take the matter up now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. Has the Senator from KNOX [Mr. Williams] any assurance
                            that the Senator from Ohio [Mr. Downey] will be here to-morrow?</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. I presume he will be here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. That being the case, I am willing that it shall be
                            postponed till tomorrow; but if it is evident nothing can be
                            accomplished by waiting, the election had better be had at once.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. We ask it as an act of courtesy. If our force is not here
                            to-morrow, as far as I am concerned, I will not ask for further
                            time.</p>
                        <p>THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR read a note from Judge Downey, is which he said
                            that in consequence of engagements entered into before the call was
                            issued for the special session, he would not be able to be in his seat
                            for a few days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. The gentleman eeems to think we should accord something for
                            his magnanimity yesterday, but I don't look at it in that way. We
                            postponed this matter so that the trains last night would bring in all
                            that would be here for a few days. We have as good a majority here to
                            day as we had yesterday - we had the same number absent that they had.
                            If gentleman could show that by waiting they would have a better show, I
                            would not object, but the Senator knows that the Republicans have a
                            majority on this floor after every Democrat is here, so that if we
                            should wait till the end of the session the result will be the same. It
                            would simply be using up one day more of the session. We intend to elect
                            if we can - and I think we have the power - a full set of Republican
                            officers. One majority is just as good as a thousand, and I am opposed
                            to waiting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. It was out of no discourtesy to members of the Damocratic
                            party that I made the motion to lay on the table. It seems to me the
                            reasons urged by the Senator from Union (Mr. Bennett) are sufficient. It
                            is understood that we have the power to elect officers, and I see no
                            good to come from delay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells. At the last session the Democratic party had the
                            power to elect a portion of the officers, and they did it. If the same
                            thing exists now, may not the Democrats, when fully represented, have
                            the power to elect a portion of the officers? To-morrow we may have a
                            full representation on this floor. It occurs to me that the course of
                            the Republican party in this matter is very inconsistent. One of the
                            resolutions I introduced this morning is identical with one introduced
                            by a Repupublican at the last session, and voted for by the Republicans
                            unanimously. To-day they have voted unanimously against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON (interrupting). I ask whether the Democrats did not vote
                            against it unanimously last session?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells. I am not prepared to say. [Laughter] But do gentlemen
                            desire to furnish an excuse for their conduct to-day if Democrats voted
                            as they should not have done last session? But gentlemen want to know
                            what will be gained by the postponement, I undertake to say that
                            yesterday we had the power to elect officers. I have just as good a
                            reason for saying that as the Senator from Union has when he says to-day
                            they have the power. Who knows but by waiting till tomorrow we may have
                            the power?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. (sotto voce.) That it is a good reason why we should vote
                            against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. That may be a good reason. But I am willing to say that if
                            to-morrow, we discover we have not the power as we had,yesterday, I
                            presume the rest of the Democratic Senators with myself will succumb,
                            and gracefully yield to tho powers that seem to be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. It is not the intention to be discourteous in this matter, but
                            I desire that this resolution should be acted upon now. It was said last
                            session that the opposition could control the organization of the Senate
                            to a certain point, and did that party propose to delay till the
                            presiding officer should take his place here and could vote? No. they
                            pressed it with all they energy possible. They urged it upon the old
                            Democratic doctrine that to the victors belong the spoils. And when they
                            got the organization as far as they could control it, they came in with
                            resolutions of compromise. Perhaps the Senator would call that courtesy.
                            I recollect that the old and hoary Senator from Vincennes got up, and,
                            with all his experience, tried to induce us younger members to believe
                            that it was the height of magnanimity in them to offer to compromise,
                            and was somewhat indignant because we could not see it in the light that
                            he did. It is well known that we have the power to organize the Senate
                            now, and that being the fact, it is an imperative duty on tha Union
                            members to press the election now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING. It is probably due to myself that I should make a remark
                            here, and I feel a little anxious to do so. It is well known that at the
                            last session of the Senate, upon my vote - unless some other Senator saw
                            causes to change his course - depended the election of our officers. I
                            had pledged myself to support Mr. Whittlesey and Mr. Broadwell before I
                            had publicly announced my determination to cooperate with the Republican
                            party. I done it because I believed both of these gentlemen would make
                            good officers. Mr. Whittlesey had served as clerk of the House in 1863,
                            and discharged his duties faithfully. Mr. Broadwell was a young
                            gentleman who acted as one of the employes of the House at the same
                            session, and discharged his duties faithfully.</p>
                        <p>He had been Clerk of the <orgName>Auditing Committee</orgName>, of which
                            I was a member, for two years, <pb n="[19]" xml:id="VAA8558-08-019"/>
                            and discharged his duties faithfully and honestly to the satisfaction of
                            all parties, and to the entire acceptance of the committee. In the
                            Republican caucus of 1865 I avowed my determination, let personal
                            consequences, as far, as opinion is concerned, to what they might, to
                            redeem my word - and I done it; and these gentlemen were elected. But I
                            do think my Democratic friends did not act with as much fairness toward
                            the Republican party as they should have done. But, as they are
                            honorable men, I might have been mistaken. I remember that my
                            distinguished friend from Ohio offered what I then denominated the
                            coolest proposition of the session. After the Secretaries were elected,
                            I may say, by my vote, be proposed, with all the gravity and sincerity
                            which characterizes his conduct, that we should distribute the two
                            offices remaining between the two parties.</p>
                        <p>But I will come down to a later day. Upon my vote, probably, would depend
                            the election of the officers of this body, at this time, unless there
                            should be, by my voting with my Democratic friends, a tie; then the
                            presiding officer would have the right to decide. But I have not counted
                            Senators to know whether the Democrats could or could not elect. I make
                            these statements as a reply to the insinuations (not unfriendly) of the
                            Senator from Wells. Your honor is apprized of the fact that there was a
                            contrariety of opinion in our Republican caucus upon the question of
                            reorganizing the two houses. In the other house they continued their
                            same officers. Here it was a question of uncertainty, and I was not
                            disposed to play the part of a go-between of the parties. But facts have
                            come to my knowledge which induced me, in Republican caucus, to vote far
                            a reorgacization of this body. I will say no more of these charges, for
                            I would not wound the feelings of any one living. In favoring
                            reorganization I cut off a Republican friend just as well as I cut off a
                            Democratic friend. I have given my support, in part, to the Damocratic
                            party, from the fact that I believed that a majority of my district,
                            even yet, may be in favor of the Democratic party. I was elected by the
                            votes of both parties, and I have the honor of saying that out of all
                            the votes cast for Senator in the county in which I have lived for
                            forty-two years, but four were cast against me. And in the other county
                            I am proud to say I received an almost unanimous vote. I gave no promise
                            to my Democratic friends that I have not fulfilled. As far as Mr.
                            Broadwell is concerned, on yesterday I said to my Republican friends in
                            caucus, that I had made up my mind to vote for him if he was a
                            candidate, and that I would not pledge myself to my Republican friends
                            to sustain their nomination for Assistant Secretary, but if I did not
                            vote for Mr. Broadwell I would support the nominees of the Republican
                            party. My want of support of the nomine was not on account of eny
                            objection I had to him. I believe Mr. Broadwell made a competent
                            Secretary, and was as honest, faithful, aid true in the discharge of his
                            duties as any officer whom I ever knew. I now say that I shall support
                            the nominees of the Republican party, and shall conform to the usages of
                            the party with which I am co-operating; and if we have the power with my
                            vote, it shall be exercised now and at all times henceforward. And why
                            should we not enter into an election of officers? We have the
                            Secretaries now, the Secretary and Assistant Secretary having resigned;
                            then why not; prepare for business? By what authority do the gentlemen
                            sitting at our tables attending to business for us, sit there? Those who
                            employed them have resigned, consequently they have no authority to

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. There are, in both ends of the Capitol, reporters for this
                            paper, and I find in a long article published this morning, that they
                            say they will give as fair, and correct, and fall report of the
                            proceedings of this body as either the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> or <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>. For that reason I introduce this
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN made an ineffectual motion - yeas 14, nays 29 - to lay the
                            resolution on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER moved to amend by adding the Indianapolis <hi rend="i">Evening
                                Gazette</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB moved to further amend by inserting the Indiana <hi rend="i">Volksblatt</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. I did not understand yesterday that this was a daily paper.
                            From an article in it this morning, I discover that they are very
                            anxious about this matter, and give a great many reasons why, as I
                            think, we ought to take it. They give the names of persons I know to be
                            very fair reporters, and they say they will give as fair reports as
                            either the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> or the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>.
                            Therefore I shall vote with the Senator from Rush to take this
                            paper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY moved to lay both resolutions on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS demanded a division of the question, whereupon - </p>
                        <p>The first amendment was laid on the table. Yeas 26; nays 18.</p>
                        <p>The Senate refused to table the second amendment - yeas 17; nays 27.</p>
                        <p>And then it was concurred in, by yeas 25; nays 16.</p>
                        <p>So the resolution was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON asked and obtained leave of absence, to attend a murder
                            trial, for the remainder of the week.</p>

                                        State of Indiana, was the most extravagant in appropriations
                                        that ever was known in the State; and, whereas, the people
                                        of the State are burdened with large taxes; therefore,</p>
                                    <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That we are in favor of

                                        assistance than is necessary to conduct the business of the
                                        session in a proper manner.</p>
                                </div>

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Let any Senator read the appropriation bill of the last
                            session, and compare it with any other session in the legislation of the
                            State of Indiana, and if he don't find it the most extravagant in
                            appropriations, then I miss my guess. It makes a total appropriation of
                            over $ 1,000, 000, without including the interest upon, the State debt.
                            For the year 1866 there is appropriated $582,937.</p>
                        <p>Mr, BENNETT (interposing). We have control over that, and if there is
                            anything wrong about it, the Senator can introduce a bill to change
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. The expenses twenty years ago were about $76,000. The
                            expenses of the General Assembly then was $25,000, and now it is
                            $100,000. How comes this difference? We have the same number of members.
                            It is this continued harrassing of our officers by members seeking
                            appointments for their friends, and the employment of incompetent man.
                            In the session referred to, Wm. H. English performed all the duties of
                            Principal Secretary, and W. J. Vawter, a brother of the Senator here,
                            those of Assistant Secretary. He cited other figures and facts in
                            support cf the assertions made in the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING. I can see no good to result from the stirring of this
                            matter. If the Senator will say in his resolution that there wes more
                            extravagance indulged in, as far as the employees of the Senate were
                            concerned, I will go with him. But we have attempted to lay an ax at the
                            root of this tree of extravagance. But it is easy to see what the object
                            of that resolution is. The object is to say by that resolution that the
                            last Legislature was the most extravagant ever held because the
                            Republican party was in power. You may whip the devil around the stump
                            as much as you will, but that is the cause of that resolution - it is to
                            fix that stigma upon the record here. To the extent I have mentioned,
                            the resolution is true, and I am almost ready to say I did it in part.
                            But I blame my friend for charging, by indirection that I elected men, I
                            will not say what one, under whom there was extravagance, I may say,
                            unparalleled. I will stand ashamed and abashed, and say that by voting
                            for two of my Democratic friends I have enabled them to make this black
                            record against me. But my friend [Mr. Wiliiams] is not aiming at the
                            humble Senator from Monroe. Put that resolution on record, and is is
                            acknowledging that the Republican party is the most extravagant. I can
                            not vote for it.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BENNETT the resolution was laid on the table by yeas 24,
                            nays 23 - the Lieutenant Governor giving the casting vote.</p>

                        <p>Mr. SHUEY called attention to the fact that the resolution offered
                            yesterday by the gentleman from Lawrence [Mr. Boyd] was amended so that
                            the Auditor of State shall report to this House, and was so adopted. The
                            Journal was not correct in that.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Journal will be corrected ia that respect.</p>
                        <p>So the Journal was authenticated and approved by the House.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS said he saw so many changes that had been made in the
                            published list of standing committees of the House that he desired to

                        <p>Mr. MILLER proposed to amend by striking out all after the word
                            "resolved," and inserting the following:</p>
                        <p>That the arrangement for stationery clerk, and the rules governing the
                            same for the regular session, be continued for the special session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the amendment would not prevail. He did not understand
                            that the position of the Stationery Clerk was an office authorized by
                            law, and hoped such an officer would not be created this session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH'S object was simply to procure the mail matter in the
                            most direct way. He agreed generally with the gentleman from
                            Jackson.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. In all probability no such officer will exist, and if so the
                            amendment would destroy the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER understood that the order of the House taken yesterday
                            continued the Stationery Clerk. He hoped the order of the last session
                            would be retained so far as this officer was concerned at least, and the
                            economical rule which it adopted with respect to the care of mail matter
                            and the procurement of stationery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. That office, if it was an office, was created by resolution -
                            not by law. The organisation of the House continues during the term, and
                            contains only such officers as are known to the law. The amendment would
                            kill the original resolution, for we have no Stationery Clerk - no such
                            officer. He closed by moving to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was laid on the table - affirmative 60, negative 10.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS moved to amend by requiring ths Doorkeeper to convey the mail
                            matter to members.</p>
                        <p>The modification was accepted, and so the original resolution was
                            adopted.</p>

                                        have all contributed to prevent the adoption of legislative
                                        measures which the progress of the State and the welfare of
                                        the people would seem to demand.</p>
                                    <p>At the last session of the General Assembly many important
                                        bills were introduced, but failed in the different stages of
                                        their progress for want of time to perfect and pass them.
                                        That the time spent on these unperfected measures might not
                                        be lost to the public, an act was passed providing that the
                                        business of any regular or special session of the General
                                        Assembly, on the calendar or files of either House, and
                                        remaining unfinished at the expiration of such session,
                                        shall, at the next succeeding special session of the same
                                        General Assembly, be transferred to the calendar of the
                                        house in which it was pending, in the same order in which
                                        such business stood at the termination of such regular or
                                        special session, and shall be taken up and disposed of in
                                        the same manner it might have been taken up and disposed of
                                        at such preceding regular or special session. The
                                        considerations before mentioned, the fact that the
                                        unfinished business of the last session upon which much
                                        intelligent labor had been bestowed, could only be saved by
                                        reconvening the General Assembly in special session, and the
                                        belief that measures of vital importance demanded
                                        legislative action before the time fixed for the next
                                        regular session, have caused me to issue the Proclamation,

                                        <p>The twenty years referred to will expire on the 19th day
                                            of January next, and the question first to be considered
                                            is whether these stocks fall due at that time, and
                                            whether the contrast made by the State requires that
                                            payment shall be made on that day. By some it has been
                                            urged that the words, "at the pleasure of the
                                            State," are to be treated as surplusage, and the
                                                <pb n="24" xml:id="VAA8558-08-024"/> money held to
                                            fall due precisely at the end of the twenty years. ln
                                            support of this view it is argued that because a State
                                            can not be compelled to pay her debts by legal process,
                                            the payment will in <hi rend="i">all</hi> cases the
                                            "at the pleasure of the State." I fail to
                                            perceive the force of this, and must hold that the
                                            language in question means just what it says, that the
                                            State may consult her own convenience as to the time of
                                            making payment, unless there is something in the history
                                            of the transaction, out of which this form of
                                            indebtedness sprang, or something contained in the law
                                            creating it, which requires that a different
                                            construction should be put upon the language. The naked
                                            legal effect of the instrument, if not modified by
                                            history or provisions of the statute creating it, I take
                                            to be this: that until the end of the twenty years the
                                            State has no right to require the creditors to take
                                            their money, and tans stop the payment of the interest,
                                            but that the money was to be paid at some time after the
                                            end of the twenty years, according to the pleasure and
                                            convenience of the State. But this pleasure of the State
                                            must be reasonably exercised, so as not to defeat the
                                            payment of the principal sum absolutely. The
                                            construction I have heard contended for, that the State
                                            may defer the payment of the principal twenty-five,
                                            fifty, or one hundred years, or in fact forever,
                                            provided the interest is promptly paid, can not be
                                            maintained; for that would be to defeat the operation of
                                            the concluding sentence of the instrument, above quoted,
                                            which solemnly pledges the good faith of the State for
                                            the payment of the principal as well as the interest.
                                            This solema pledge would be a nullity if the State was
                                            at liberty to defer the payment of the principal
                                            forever, or indefinitely, by the prompt payment of the
                                            interest.</p>
                                        <p>The next question to be considered is whether there is
                                            anything in the statutes creating this stock, or in the
                                            history of the whole transaction, showing the intention
                                            of the parties as to the time when the principal should
                                            bs paid, or pointing to a period beyond which the State
                                            would have no right to defer its payment.</p>
                                        <p>On the 1st of July, 1846, the State was indebted upon
                                            bonds issued and sold for purposes of internal
                                            improvement in the sum of eleven millions and ninety
                                            thousand dollars ($11,090,000), On these bonds the
                                            interest had not been paid since 1841, The interest due
                                            and in arrears amounted to three millions fifiy-five
                                            thousand four hundred and thirty dollars
                                            ($3,055,430).</p>
                                        <p>These bonds were issued between the years 1832 and 1842,
                                            were of different denominations, and were to run for
                                            twenty-five and thirty years, and bore interest at the
                                            rate of five, six, and seven per centum per annum,
                                            payable semi-annually, for which there were coupons
                                            signed and attached to the bonds. The State finding
                                            herself unable to pay the interest on her indebtedness
                                            accepted of a proposition made by her creditors, the
                                            details of which will be found embodied in the Act of
                                            January,1846 and the supplementary Act of January, 1847,
                                            which taken together, constitute what is generally known
                                            as the "Butler Bill." By the compromise and
                                            settlement as finally concluded in the supplement Act of
                                            1847, the Wabash and Erie Canal, together with the lands
                                            which had been granted to the State to aid in its
                                            construction, were transferred, the canal in perpetuity,
                                            and the lands in fee simple, to certain trustees <hi rend="i">in trust</hi> for the bondholders, in
                                            absolute payment and discharge of one half the principal
                                            and accrued interest of the debt, which half
                                            thenceforward and forever ceased to be a liability
                                            against the State or a charge upon her revenues. The
                                            bond holders upon tbeir part agreed to make such
                                            additional subscriptions as might be necessary to
                                            complete the canal to Evansville estimated at eight
                                            hundred thousand dollars ($800,000), which condition was
                                            complied with on their part, and the canal so completed.
                                            For the other half of the debt, principal and interest,
                                            the State was to issue to the bondholders certificates
                                            of indebtedness or stock. Upon such stock issued for the
                                            principal sum, the State was to pay interest at the rate
                                            of five per cent, per annum, semi-annually. The interest
                                            in arrears from 1841 to 1847 was funded, and interest on
                                            the aggregate thus funded was calculated at the rate of
                                            two and a half per cent per annum from January 1, 1847,
                                            to January 1, 1853, and added to it, and for the whole
                                            amount stocks were issued bearing interest at the rate
                                            of two and a half per cent, per annum from the 1st day
                                            of January, 1853, payable Semi-annually. The arrangement
                                            was a complicated one, involving many details which it
                                            ia not necessary to give here, and I shall only present
                                            a very brief outline.</p>
                                        <p>The Act of 1846 was, in many important respects, modified
                                            and amended by the Supplementary Act of 1847, and the
                                            two together constitute the basis and consideration upon
                                            which the creditors released the State from all
                                            liability for one-half the principal and interest of the
                                            debt.</p>
                                        <p>The first section of the Act of 1846 concludes in these
                                            words:</p>
                                        <p>"<hi rend="i">And provided further</hi>, That if the
                                            revenues of the State, up to the first day of January,

                                            cents on every one hundred dollars of value, and a poll
                                            tax of seventy-five cents, shall not, by reason of the
                                            taxes being paid in six per centum treasury notes, or
                                            from other causes, be sufficient, after defraying the
                                            current expenses of the Government, to pay said rate of
                                            interest of two per centum, then and in that case, the
                                            State shall only be required to pay, up to said first
                                            day of January, 1853, such rate of interest as the par

                                            aforesaid, shall enable her to do; which shall be paid
                                            and distributed, <hi rend="i">pro rata</hi>, on the

                                        <p>It will be perceived that this section does not, in
                                            direct terms, make a levy of twenty-five cents on every
                                            one hundred dollars of value, and of seventy-five cents
                                            on each poll, but it evidently proceeds upon the
                                            hypothesis that such a tax shall be levied and continued
                                            for a series of years. The act of which this section is
                                            a part was reported to the Legislature by Hon. Henry <pb n="25" xml:id="VAA8558-08-025"/> Secrest, Chairman
                                            of a Special Joint Comittee to whom tho subject had been
                                            referred. He accompanied the bill with a report from the
                                            Committee, from which I extract the following
                                            passsge:</p>
                                        <p>"By reference to the tables appended to the second
                                            proposition of Mr. Butler, it will be seen that if the
                                            taxables in the State shall increase at the rate of
                                            $6,000,000 year in value (which is a moderate estimate,)
                                            a tax of twenty-five cents on the hundred dollars, and
                                            seventy-five cents poll, will afford the means of paying
                                            the State expenses, absorbing all the six per cent.
                                            treasury notes, and paying two per cent, interest upon
                                            the public debt, up to the year 1853; and from and after
                                            that time paying the State expenses at two and a half
                                            per cent, upon the entire funded debt of the State,
                                            including back interest and deficiencies of interest;
                                            and not only so, but that the proceeds of the same tax
                                            would, in addition, produce an annually increasing
                                            surplus, to be set apart for the absorption cf the
                                            principal of the public debt - which surplus for the
                                            single year, 1860, would be about $140,000."</p>
                                        <p>From this it clearly appears to have been contemplated by
                                            the committee that a continuing tax of twenty-five cents
                                            on every one hundred dollars, and seventy-five cents
                                            poll, was to be assessed for the payment of the
                                            principal and interest of the debt, and reference is
                                            made to certain tables which had been prepared by Mr.
                                            Butler, going to show what would be accomplished by such
                                            a tax, estimating the increase of ths polls to be six
                                            thousand per year, and the increase of taxable property
                                            at six millions of dollars per year, and carrying the
                                            calculation as far down as 1860. Mr. Butler's
                                            calculation, however, turned out to be greatly
                                            erroneous, inasmuch as the ordinary expenses of tbe
                                            State Government were estimated too low, and the
                                            increase of taxable property from 1846 to 1864, averaged
                                            nearly twenty-one million of dollars, instead of only
                                            six millions per annum. On the next day after the
                                            passage of this bill, and apparently in pursuance of its
                                            provisions, the Legislature passed an Act making a
                                            general levy, for State purposes, of seventy-five cents
                                            poll, and twenty-five cents on each one hundred dollars
                                            worth of property.</p>
                                        <p>In the supplementary act of the next year, 1847, the
                                            following provision will be found contained in the 14th
                                            section:</p>
                                        <p>"And whereas, doubts have been suggested on the
                                            parts of some such last mentioned persons (foreigners
                                            holding bonds,) in respect of the matters hereinafter
                                            mentioned or referred to, which doubts may operate
                                            prejudicially to the operations contemplated by the said
                                            recited act, and it is therefore expedient that the same
                                            be removed. Now, to demonstrate the good faith of the
                                            State of Indiana, and for the removal of all such doubts
                                            as aforesaid, and with the view to create general
                                            confidence in the arrangement made in the said recited

                                        <p>The only taxes referred to in the act of 1846 were the
                                            seventy-five cents poll and the twenty-five cents on the
                                            one hundred dollars worth of property, and by this
                                            section the good faith of the State is solemnly pledged
                                            that the said taxes shall be maintained inviolate and in
                                            full force, and the proceeds thereof faithfully applied
                                            to the payment of the principal and interest of the
                                            stocks created in pursuance of the act of 1846. The
                                            substance of this pledge, and of the understanding
                                            entertained by the legislature on the one hand and the
                                            bondholders on the other, may be briefly stated as this:
                                            That a tax of seveaty-five cents on each poll, and
                                            twenty-five cents on each one hundred dollars of
                                            property, should be continuously levied, and that after
                                            defraying the ordinary expenses of the State Government,
                                            and paying the interest on the debt, the surplus
                                            proceeds should be applied to the liquidation of the
                                            principal turn.</p>
                                        <p>The new Constitution, which was framed in 1850, three
                                            years after the passage of this act, contains the
                                            following provision:</p>
                                        <p>Section 2, Article X: "All the revenues derived from
                                            the sale of any of the public works belonging to the
                                            State, and from the net annual income thereof, and any
                                            surplus that may at any time remain in the Treasury
                                            derived trom taxation for general State purposes after
                                            the payment of the ordinary expenses of the government,
                                            and of the interest on bonds of the State, other than
                                            bank bonds, shall be annually applied under the
                                            direction of the General Assembly, to the payment of the

                                        <p>This provision evidently contemplates the speedy payment
                                            of the public debt, and the existence of an annual
                                            surplus to arise from general taxation for State
                                            purposes, and imperatively commands the annual
                                            application cf such surplus to the liquidation of the
                                            public debt.</p>

                                            expediency of appropriating all the revenues derived
                                            from the sale of any of the public works belonging to
                                            the State, and from the net income thereof, and also any
                                            surplus that may at any time remain in the treasury
                                            derived from taxation for general State purposes, after
                                            the payment of the ordinary expenditures, have had the
                                            same under consideration, and have come <pb n="26" xml:id="VAA8558-08-026"/>to the conclusion that the
                                            entire debt of the Stato will be paid within fifteen
                                            years, by a continuation, of the rate of taxation
                                            prescribed by law, have directed me to report the
                                            accompanying section, to be engrafted in the new
                                            Constitution, and ask to be discharged from the farther
                                            consideration of the subjects embraced in said
                                            resolutions."</p>
                                        <p>This report was submitted by Judge Hall, of Gibson
                                            county, one of the most eminent lawyers in the State,
                                            and is so explicit in regard to the understanding of the
                                            committee that the tax was to be continued, and that it
                                            would pay the debt by 1865, that it leaves no room to
                                            doubt as to the purpose for which the constitutional
                                            provision was introduced.</p>
                                        <p>Afterwards, on the 25th day of January, 1851, this
                                            provision came up in the Convention for consideration,
                                            when Mr. Howe, of Lagrange, offered to amend by adding
                                            the following clause, not as a substitute, but
                                            additional:</p>
                                        <p>"That a specific tax of fifty thousand dollars, with
                                            an annual increase of five per cent., be levied for
                                            twenty-five years, and expended each year in the
                                            purchase of our State bonds, unless the State debt is
                                            sooner paid off."</p>
                                        <p>In support of his amendment he used the following
                                            language:</p>
                                        <p>"It is very probable that the present rate and
                                            method of taxation guaranteed in what is commonly called
                                            the Butler Bill, will be observed; but even if tbat
                                            taxation affods a fund for the payment of the debt, this
                                            will enable us to pay it off sooner. Besides our public
                                            debt was contracted chiefly for the benefit of property,
                                            and property should pay it."</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Harden then said:</p>
                                        <p>"I desire to make an inquiry of my friend from
                                            Gibson (Mr. Hall), whether the section now under
                                            consideration provides that any overplus of the taxes
                                            arising from the imposition of twenty-five cents tax on
                                            the hundred dollars valuation, shall be applied to the
                                            definite object of liquidating the principal of our
                                            outstandirg State debt after the payment of the interest
                                            on the debt?"</p>
                                        <p>In answer to this question, Judge Hall said:</p>
                                        <p>"The arrangement, and only arrangement, with our
                                            bondholders, was under the acts of 1846 and 1847, by
                                            which twenty-five cents on every hundred dollars worth
                                            of taxable property, and seventy-five cents poll tax,
                                            were pledged for the payment of the principal and
                                            interest of the public debt until it shall be entirely
                                            paid. According to a calculation made, if this system of
                                            taxation shall be continued, in eighteen years the
                                            entire public debt will be paid off. The committee of
                                            which I am chairman, having charge of the subject,
                                            believing that there was a propriety in placing it
                                            beyond the power of the Legislature to violate the
                                            pledged faith of the State, instructed me to introduce a
                                            section providing that the twenty-fire cants on each one
                                            hundred dollars of taxable property, and seventy-five
                                            cents poll tax, should ba annually assessed until the
                                            debt was paid. This section was laid upon the table,
                                            and, I think, inconsiderately. I think the matter should
                                            be placed beyond the power of change by the
                                            Legislature."</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Borden then replied as follows:</p>
                                        <p>"Sir, on a previous occasion, I desired that this
                                            should be done; because I know that this is the wish of
                                            the people I have been sent here to represent. They do
                                            not want the subject to be left with the Legislature.
                                            They are willing to carry out in good faith the
                                            arrangement made with the bondholders of the State, and
                                            to pay twenty-five cents tax upon every one hundred
                                            dollars valuation, until the State debt is extinguished;
                                            and they desire that a clause shall be inserted in the
                                            Constitution which shall secure the application of this
                                            overplus to the extinguishment of the principal of the
                                            Stats debt."</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Stevenson then followed, opposing Mr. Howe's
                                            amendment, on the ground that taxes should not be levied
                                            in the Constitution, and in conclusion used these
                                            words:</p>
                                        <p>"Sir, this attempt to levy an additional tax upon
                                            the people by us is all wrong. I believe there is virtue
                                            enough in the people to settle this matter through their
                                            representatives in the Legislature, and I much prefer to
                                            leave it with that body."</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Walpole followed in a speech, opposing the adoption
                                            of the original section reported by the Committee, for
                                            the reason that he would do nothing to confirm the
                                            contract made by the State with the bondholders unless
                                            there was also a provision requiring the bondholders to
                                            perform their part of the contract.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Maguire followed in support of the original section
                                            as reported by the Committee, and referred with
                                            approbation to the calculation, showing that the then
                                            existing rate of taxation would pay the debt in fifteen
                                            or sixteen years, if the surplus was properly applied
                                            from year to year in the purchase of our stocks at the
                                            market value.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Ritchie then moved to recommit the section, with
                                            instructions to strike out and insert that, "the
                                            present rate of taxation, twenty five cents on taxable
                                            property, and seventy-five cents on each poll, shall be
                                            continued until the indebtedness of the State is fully
                                            liquidated."</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Ritchie then said:</p>
                                        <p>"I would remark that this is a transcript; of the
                                            report; of the Committee on the subject, and I have no
                                            doubt if this course is adopted that in some fifteen or
                                            eighteen years the public indebtedness of the State will
                                            cease to exist. Under the action of the General Assembly
                                            we made this agreement with our bondholders in reference
                                            to the payment of the bonds they held, which constituted
                                            the public debt. The adoption of a proposition of this
                                            kind will not only increase the credit of the State, but
                                            do away with any suspicion that we have any disposition,
                                            to repudiate the contracts we have made. We owe it to
                                            our constituents that we should endeavor to erase the
                                            unjust aspersions cast upon them in relation to this
                                            matter. And it is due also to our bondholders that we
                                            should repeat here, in this Convention, the action of
                                            the Legislature in the arrangement made by which, in
                                            some fifteen years, we will rid our State of its public
                                            debt."</p>
                                        <p>Here the debate ended, and the original section was
                                            adopted, both amendments being laid upon the table.</p>
                                        <p>I have referred particularly to this debate to show the
                                            views entertained by the Committes reporting the
                                            Constitutitional provision, and <pb n="27" xml:id="VAA8558-08-027"/>the understanding of the
                                            Convention at the time of its adoption. It seems clearly
                                            to have been understood by the Convention that the
                                            Butler Bill guaranteed the continuance of the tax of
                                            seventy-five cents on each poll and twenty-five cents on
                                            each one hundred dollars worth of property, until the
                                            debt was liquidated, and the main subject of discussion
                                            was whether this guaruntee should be specifically
                                            incorporated into the Constitution.</p>
                                        <p>If the levy and continuance of a specified tax for the
                                            payment of the principal and interest of the debt was
                                            guaranteed in the original arrangement made by the
                                            Legislature with the creditors, it would be conclusive
                                            evidence that the State and the creditors were looking
                                            to the payment of the principal sum as well as the
                                            interest, and that the State could not, in good faith,
                                            indefinitely postpone the payment of the principal
                                            sum.</p>
                                        <p>But it is equally clear, from Mr. Butler's
                                            calculations, that he did not expect that the taxes
                                            which were guaranteed would be sufficient, to pay the
                                            debt by the 19th day of January, 1866, for, in fact, by
                                            his tables, the principal of the debt could not be paid
                                            before 1872 or 1874, and when we take his tables in
                                            connection with the language of the certificate,
                                            "redeemable at any time after twenty years at the
                                            pleasure of the State," it is manifest that Mr.
                                            Butler had no assurance that the principal of the debt
                                            would be paid promptly at the end of the twenty
                                            years.</p>
                                        <p>It turned out, however, that the basis of taxation was
                                            far more favorable to the speedy payment of the debt
                                            than was contemplated by Mr. Butler and the Legislature
                                            of 1846, for the average increase of taxable property,
                                            from that time until the present, has been, as before
                                            stated, nearly twenty-one millions of dollars per annum,
                                            instead if six millions. And a Circulation which I have
                                            caused to be made, will show that if the guaranteed
                                            rates of taxation had been maintained, thera would be in
                                            the Treasury, on the 1st day of January, 1866, a surplus
                                            of four millions eight hundred and ten thousand seven
                                            hundred and four dollars and thirty-one cents ($4
                                            810,704 31), after defraying the ordinary expenses of
                                            the State Government, and the interest on the State debt
                                            from year to year; and it is easy to show that if this
                                            surplus had been applied from time to time, as it
                                            accrued, to the purchase of our stocks at their market
                                            value, the whole debt would bave been paid by the 19th
                                            day of January, 1866.</p>
                                        <p>It was well understood by Mr. Butler and the bondholders,
                                            in 1846, that these rates of taxation were all that the
                                            State was able to bear at that time, or would be able to
                                            bear for many years, and the language of the
                                            certificates, making the principal payable "after
                                            the end of twenty years at the pleasure of the
                                            State," shows that the Legislature entertained
                                            doubts whether the State would be able to pay promptly
                                            at the end of twenty years, and that they did not intend
                                            to place her in a situation where, if she failed to make
                                            such payment, she would violate her contract, and stand
                                            before the world so repudiating or bankrupt.</p>
                                        <p>In 1852 the Legislature departed from these rates of
                                            taxation, and reduced the levy to twenty cents on each
                                            one hundred dollars worth of property, and fifty cents
                                            on each poll. This rate upon polls was continued until
                                            1865, but the levy upon taxable property fluctuated from
                                            fifteen to twenty cents on the one hundred dollars from
                                            1853 to 1861.</p>
                                        <p>In 1852 the Legislature passed an act creating the State
                                            Debt Sinking Fund, and levying a tax of two cents on the
                                            one hundred dollars "for the reduction and ultimate
                                            extinction of the public debt."This fund was was
                                            placed under the control of three Commissioners,
                                            consisting of the Auditor, Treasurer, and Agent of
                                            State; who were directed to invest the procceds of the
                                            tax from time to time in the purchase of the two and a
                                            half and five per cent. stocks. The interest on the
                                            stocks thus purchased was to be paid semi-annually to
                                            the Commissioners, who were to invest the same in
                                            similar stocks, and thus create a Sinking Fund for the
                                            ultimate redemption of the stocks created by the Butler
                                            Bill.</p>
                                        <p>In 1847 the Legislature failed to levy any tax for State
                                            purposes for the years 1857 and 1858, and for those two
                                            years no revenue was collected. In 1859 an act was
                                            passed instructing the Auditor of State to sell the
                                            stocks which had been purchased by the State Debt
                                            Sinking Fund to the Board of Commissioners of the
                                            Sinking Fond, in order to raise money to defray the
                                            ordinary expenses of the State Government, and to supply
                                            the deficiencies in revenue growing out of the failure
                                            to levy and collect taxes for the preceding two years.
                                            This act being held void for want of a title, the Board
                                            of Commissioners of the Sinking Fund refused to act upon
                                            it, but the Auditor of State treating it as an
                                            instruction, sold the stocks in open market and put the
                                            money into the Treasury. At the regular session in 1861
                                            it was enacted, that for the year 1863, and every year
                                            thereafter, five cents be levied on each one hundred
                                            dollars worth of property for the reduction and ultimate
                                            extinction of the public dabt, to be used by the State
                                            Dabt sinking Fand Commissioners as before described, but
                                            at the extra session in the same year, an act was passed
                                            diverting this tax, and that for the years 1861 and
                                            1862, from the State Debt Sinking Fund, to the payment
                                            of the War Loan, which had just been authorized, with a
                                            provision, however, that if the holders of the War Loan
                                            Bonds would not sell them to the State at rates not
                                            exceeding their par value, the proceeds of the tax
                                            should ba invested in the stocks created by the Butler
                                            Bill, according to the terms of the original act
                                            creating the State Debt Slaking Fund.</p>
                                        <p>This legislative history, it must be admitted, is rather
                                            curious and contradictory, and comes short of performing
                                            the obligations which the State in 1846 entered into
                                            with her creditors.</p>
                                        <p>For this non-performance, up to 1861, a valid excuse can
                                            hardly be found, but for what has happened since, the
                                            excuse is ample. The contingencies and necessities of
                                            war override all other considerations, and if they cause
                                            a failure in the strict performance of a contract, it
                                            would not subject a State to the imputation of being
                                            wanting in good faith.</p>
                                        <p>In view of the whole matter as I have presented it, the
                                            just conclusion seems to be this. <pb n="28" xml:id="VAA8558-08-028"/>that while the State is not
                                            bound to pay the principal of this debt on the 19th of
                                            January, 1866, or be considered in default, yet that she
                                            is not at liberty to postpone the payment of it
                                            indefinitely; that to do so would be to violate the fair
                                            construction of the certificate itself, and the explicit
                                            understanding that existed in the Legislatures of 1846
                                            and 1847, and in the Convention of 1850, as shown by
                                            their several enactments and debates; but that she is
                                            bound to make provision to pay the debt within such
                                            reasonable time after the twenty years as may comport
                                            with the original understanding of the parties, the
                                            ability and condition of the State, as left by the war,
                                            the faithful performance of her contracts, and the
                                            preservation of her good name. The whole subject is
                                            therefore commended to your careful consideration, in
                                            the hope that your conclusion, whatever it shall be, may
                                            be announced before your final adjournment, so that the
                                            State and her creditors may know what they have to
                                            depend upon.</p>
                                        <p>As before shown the amount of these stocks outstanding in
                                            the hands of our creditors and to be provided for is six
                                            millions thirty-six thousand and eighty dollars and
                                            thirty-three cents (6,036,080 33).</p>
                                        <p>The Auditor of State has furnished me a statement in
                                            which he estimated that there will be in the Treasury,
                                            on account of State Debt Sinking Fund, on the 1st day of

                                            ($1,000,000).</p>
                                        <p>The Board of Commissioners of the Old Sinking Fund will

                                            January, 1866, the sum of six hundred thousand dollars
                                            ($600,000).</p>
                                        <p>There is due also to the Old Sinking Fund about nine
                                            hundred thousand dollars ($900,000) on loans secured by
                                            mortgages of real estate, which, however, could not be
                                            made available for several years, owing to the extension
                                            of time made by the State to the motgagers, unless by
                                            the issue of a like amount of bonds bearing six percent.
                                            interest, which is one per cent. less than that which
                                            the State receives on the mortgages, the bonds to be
                                            paid out of the proceeds of the mortgages when
                                            collected. These bonds disposed of to our creditors or
                                            others, at par value, and the moneys referred to, if
                                            promptly invested in our stocks, would procure some two
                                            millions six hundred and fifty thousand dollars
                                            ($2,650,000) of our stocks, and thus reduce the amount
                                            in the hands of our creditors to three millions three
                                            hundred and eighty-six thousand and eighty dollars and
                                            thirty-three cents ($3,386,080 33).</p>
                                        <p>The cash on hand in the Old Sinking Fund draws no
                                            interest, and has not for many months, and without
                                            regard to the conclusion you may come to as to the time
                                            or mode of paying the public debt, I earnestly recommend
                                            that all the cash and other assets belonging to the Old
                                            Sinking Fund, be as speedily as possible invested in our
                                            State stocks, and the somewhat formidable and costly
                                            machinery by which that fund has been managed,
                                            abolished. The fund thus converted into our stocks can
                                            be easily managed by the Auditor of State with equal
                                            advantage to our common schools, and at a saving of no
                                            small expense. Of course it will be understood that such
                                            stocks as now belong to the Old Sinking Fund, or as may
                                            be purchased by its assets, must in some form be kept
                                            alive for the benefit of the School Fund, so that that
                                            fund which is made inviolable by the Constitution, may
                                            not suffer by the conversion.</p>
                                        <p>The financial system of Indiana is complicated,
                                            expensive, and anomalous. The State is a debtor, owing
                                            large sums of money, upon which she pays interest
                                            semi-annually, and incurs all the expenses thereto
                                            necessarily incident, such as the keeping of an agency
                                            in New York, the purchase of exchange, and other items
                                            of cost too numerous to mention. She is at the same time
                                            a lender of money, and maintains an expensive machinery
                                            to carry on that operation, and is subject, of course,
                                            to occasional losses incident to all money lenders.</p>
                                        <p>If, therefore, the trust funds of the State could be
                                            invested in her own stocks it would greatly cheapen and
                                            simplify her financial system, and restore to its
                                            administration that public confidence, the absence of
                                            which has long been felt.</p>
                                        <p>Should the assets of the sinking funds be converted into
                                            our public debt, as I have suggested, the whole debt of
                                            the State left outstanding in the hands of her creditors
                                            to be provided for might be thus stated: </p>

                                        <p>It is not creditable to the State that any provision of
                                            its Constitution, mandatory in its character, and not in
                                            conflict with the National Constitution, should remain a
                                            dead letter because of the non-action of the legislative
                                            department. If law-makers would have their enactments
                                            obeyed by the masses they should set an example of
                                            obedience by a prompt and faithful performance of those
                                            duties enjoined upon them by the higher law contained in
                                            the Constitution itself. More than fourteen years have
                                            elapsed since the adoption of the present Constitution
                                            of the State, and to this day there are two subjects on
                                            which its language is that of positive command where
                                            there has been no corresponding obedience - one of these
                                            subjects being almost vital to the existence of the
                                            Legislature itself. The first of these is the periodical
                                            enumeration of the white male inhabitants above
                                            twenty-one years of age, and the periodical
                                            apportionment of Senators and Representatives, based
                                            upon this enumeration. The other is the providing of
                                            Houses of Correction and Reformation far juvenile
                                            offenders.</p>
                                        <p>Allow me earnestly to call your attention to both of
                                            these constitutional mandates in the order above stated.
                                            The Constitution of 1851 provides that the first and
                                            second elections of members of the General Assembly
                                            after its taking effect shall be According to the
                                            apportionment last made by the General Assembly before
                                            the adoption of said Constitution. This <pb n="29" xml:id="VAA8558-08-029"/> provision gave ample time
                                            for making the enumeration and apportionment required by
                                            the organic law of the State. The Constitution says that
                                            the General Assembly <hi rend="i">shall,</hi> at its
                                            second session after the adoption of this Constitution,
                                            and every six years thereafter, cause an enumeration to
                                            be made of all the white male inhabitants over the age
                                            of twenty-one years. It further says that, "the
                                            number of Senators and Representatives shall, at the
                                            session next following each period of making such
                                            enumeration, be fixed by law and apportioned among the
                                            several counties according to the number of white male
                                            inhabitants above twenty-one years of age in each."
                                            The General Assembly of 1863 designed to carry out the
                                            first of these provisions by passing an act approved
                                            Febrary 24th, 1853, entitled, "An act to provide
                                            for the enumeration of all white male inhabitants over
                                            the age of twenty-one years, in the State of Indiana in
                                            the year 1853, and pay the officers for taking the
                                            same." In consequence of defects in this law, as I
                                            understand the matter, the enumeration contemplated by
                                            it was never completed and published, and although more
                                            than twelve years have since elapsed, no other act
                                            providing for an enumeration has been passed. In 1857
                                            the General Assembly passed an act entitled, "An
                                            act to apportion Senators and Representatives for the
                                            next four years." This act was not based upon an
                                            enumeration of the white male inhabitants of the State
                                            over the age of twenty-one years, for no such
                                            enumeration had been completed, and although it has long
                                            since expired by its own limitation, no other
                                            apportionment law has been enacted in its place, and by
                                            common consent, and from the necessity of the case,
                                            members of both houses of the General Assembly are still
                                            elected under the provisions of this law which has
                                            ceased to exist and which if in existence, has become
                                            grossly unjust and unequal by the change in the
                                            population of the several counties of the State since
                                            1857. A literal compliance with the Constitution as to
                                            enumeration and apportionment is now impossible, but the
                                            nearest practicable approach to it abould be promptly
                                            made. To this end, I recommend the passage of an act
                                            providing for an enumeration such as is contemplated by
                                            the Constitution, to be made in 1866, and another in the
                                            year 1871, and another every sixth years after the year
                                            1871. These periodical enumerations should be provided
                                            for by a permanent enactment that would require no
                                            renewal at the expiration of each period of six years,
                                            and to secure its enforcement there should be adequate
                                            penalties for any failure of duty on the part of the
                                            officers charged with making the enumeration. To meet
                                            the present emergency I further recommend the passage of
                                            a law, temporary in in its character, making a new
                                            apportionment of Senators and Representatives on the
                                            basis of the votes cast at the Presidential election in
                                            1864, such apportionment to continue until a new one can
                                            be made, based upon the enumeration required by the
                                            Constitution.</p>

                                            been wholly disregarded, relates to the establishment of
                                            Houses of Correction and Reform for Juvenile
                                            Offenders.</p>
                                        <p>The second section of the ninth article of the
                                            Constitution reads as follows, viz:</p>
                                        <p>"The General Assembly shall provide Houses of Refuge
                                            for the Correction and Reformation of Juvenile
                                            Offenders."</p>
                                        <p>In accordance with this humane and enlightened provision,
                                            the eighteenth section of the first article further
                                            provides that the penal code shall be founded on the
                                            principles of reformation, and not of vindictive
                                            justice.It may well be doubted whether the county jails
                                            should, in any instance be used as places of punishment
                                            for any class of offenders, and whether they should not
                                            be solely employed as places of detention of accused
                                            persons awaiting trial. Be this as it may, there can be
                                            no doubt as to the duty and policy of speedily
                                            establishing Houses of Reform for Juvenile
                                            Offenders.</p>
                                        <p>The Legislature of 1855, impressed with the propriety of
                                            providing a place in which youthful offenders might be
                                            confined, uncontaminated by the proximity and examples
                                            of old and hardened offenders, authorized a purchase of
                                            a tract of land a few miles west of Indianapolis for the
                                            express purpose of establishing a house of Reform for
                                            Juvenile Offenders. In pursuance of this authority the
                                            land was purchased, but since then nothing further has
                                            been done to carry into execution the provisions of the
                                            Constitution on this subject.</p>
                                        <p>Institutions of this description have ceased to be an
                                            experiment, numbers of them having been established in
                                            other States of the Union, with the most beneficial
                                            results. I most earnestly recommend that immediate steps
                                            be taken for carrying into execution, with the least

                                        <p>The restoration of peace and the consequent discharge
                                            from the service of the United States of the major part
                                            of the Volunteers of this State, since the adjournment
                                            of the General Assembly, render it proper that there
                                            should be a complete and thorough revision of the Act
                                            for the relief of the families of soldiers, seamen and
                                            marines, and sick and wounded soldiers in hospitals,
                                            approved March 4th, 1865. Difficulties have arisen in
                                            the construction of the act, and although the Auditor of
                                            State has taken great pains to prevent a diversity of
                                            action in taking the enumeration contemplated by the
                                            act, I regret to say his efforts have not been
                                            successful in procuring entire uniformity. There is also
                                            a want of uniformity of construction as to the persons
                                            entitled to receive the benefits of the act, the local
                                            authorities in some counties, as I am informed, holding
                                            that the soldier's family must be reduced to a
                                            condition of absolute pauperism, before they can receive
                                            the allowance provided for by the act, while in other
                                            counties, relief has been afforded whenever the
                                            soldier's family was, in the language of the
                                            seventh section of the act, otherwise without
                                            "sufficient means for their comfortable
                                            support," although they might possess some property
                                            or means. The latter is obviously the proper
                                            construction, and it is greatly to be regretted that the
                                            act should not have <pb n="30" xml:id="VAA8558-08-030"/>
                                            been liberally construed in all parts of the State.</p>
                                        <p>There is also some uncertainty as to the time when the
                                            weekly allowance provided by the act shall commence, or
                                            from what time it shall be computed to those entitled,
                                            although in my opinion the Auditor of State has very
                                            properly decided that the allowance should commence from
                                            the date of the passage of the Act. So far as it may be
                                            neceesary to continue the provisions of the Act in
                                            force, I recommerd the adoption of such explanatory
                                            legislation as may be neceseary to remove existing
                                            ambiguities, and to secure the benefits of the Act to
                                            all those within its scope and spirit, and to prevent
                                            the illiberal construction before alluded to. The Act
                                            contemplates the levy and collection of a three mill tax
                                            on all taxable property, and a poll tax of one dollar on
                                            each taxable poll, for each of the years 1865 and 1866,
                                            I respectfully suggest that under existing circumstances
                                            it, will neither be necessary or proper that these taxes
                                            should be levied or collected for the year 1866,
                                            believing that the levy for 1865, if properly disbursed,
                                            will be sufficient to furnish all the relief that the
                                            altered condition of the country demands.</p>

                                            such an institution, I issued an address, of which a

                                            the invitation contained in this address, two successive
                                            meetings were held at Indianapolis, for the purpose of
                                            effecting a temporary organization of a Home for
                                            disabled Indiana soldiers and seamen, and to inaugurate
                                            a system for the collection of voluntary contributions
                                            sufficient to place it ultimately on a permanent

                                        <p>At the second of these meetings, held on the 24th day of
                                            May last, a temporary organization was effected, the
                                            basis of which will be seen by reference to a copy of
                                            the proceedings of said meeting, herewith respectfully
                                            submitted.</p>
                                        <p>Soon after, application for relief on the part of
                                            disabled soldiers were presented to the officers of the
                                            Association, and the Common Council of the City of
                                            Indianapolis, generously tendered the gratituous use of
                                            the City Hospital Buildings to the managers of the
                                            Association for a temporary Home, which offer was
                                            accepted, with the distinct understanding that its
                                            acceptance should not in any degree influence the
                                            ultimate location of the Institution, should the effort
                                            to place it on a permanent basis, be successful. The
                                            temporary Home was opened on the seventh day of August
                                            last, and the absolute necessity for such an Institution
                                            is demonstrated by the fact that already forty-six (46)
                                            disabled soldiers have been admitted into the
                                            Institution, twenty-one (21) of whom, after remaining
                                            some time and receiving the best care and medical
                                            treatment, have been discharged with the prospect of
                                            being sufficiently restored to enable them to care for
                                            themselves, and one has died, leaving twenty-four still
                                            to be cared for. Of the twenty-four still in the
                                            Institution, seventeen are totally disabled, either by
                                            old age, disease, or wounds received in battle.</p>
                                        <p>The funds received by the Treasurer of the Home for
                                            voluntary contributions, amount in the aggregate to $4
                                            994 55, in addition to which there are unpaid
                                            subscriptions, the estimated amount of which will
                                            increase this to over $20,000. It is to be feared that
                                            the Institution can not be placed upon a permanent
                                            foundation by voluntary contributions, and in view of
                                            this I submit the entire subject to the General
                                            Assembly, and respectfully, but earnestly recommend that
                                            prompt measures be taken to secure the object in view,
                                            feeling eassured thait it will commend itself to your
                                            judgment and sympathies.</p>
                                        <p>The United Spates General Hospital, at Jeffersonville, in
                                            one of the most complete establishments of the kind in
                                            the country, and is well adapted to the purposes of a
                                            Soldier's Home. I have written to the Secretary of
                                            War and Surgeon General for information, as to whether
                                            the Government would be willing to turn over this
                                            hospital to the State of Indiana, to be used in the
                                            establishment of such an institution, should the State
                                            desire it. The answer, when received, will be
                                            communicated to the General Assembly.</p>

                                        <p>The public interests require that there should be seme
                                            legislation on the subject of Official Bonds, to prevent
                                            the sureties therein from setting up, as a defense to
                                            actions brought on such bonds, same unperformed
                                            outstanding agreement between them and their principals.
                                            Under existing decisions a surety in an Official Bond,
                                            when sued thereon, may plead, as a defense, that when he
                                            signed the bond the principal promised him that he would
                                            procure some other person to execute it as a co-surety,
                                            and that the bond was filed and approved in violation of
                                            this agreement. Sound policy requires that when Official
                                            Bands are properly approved, and fixed in the proper
                                            office, there should be no doubt as to their bidding
                                            obligation on all the parties executing the same. I
                                            respectfully recommend the passage of a law, providing
                                            that every principal and surety in an Official Bond
                                            shall be required, before such bond is approved, to
                                            acknowledge its execution before some officer authorized
                                            to take the acknowledgement of deeds, the
                                            acknowledgement to be certified on the bond, and making
                                            the bond thus acknowledged as binding, to all intents
                                            and purposes, upon such surety as it is upon the
                                            principal, and declaring that as between the State and
                                            the surety, such surety shall be deemed and taken to be
                                            a principal, and expressly prohibiting him from setting
                                            up any defense thereto, other than such as might avail
                                            the principal.</p>

                                        <p>The experiment inaugurated in 1852, of depriving the
                                            grand juries of jurisdiction over misdemeanors, has been
                                            fully and fairly tested, and I respectfully submit, that
                                            the lesson taught has not confirmed the wisdom of this
                                            change, in the administration of our penal code.
                                            Experience, I think, has clearly demonstrated that where
                                            it is not made the sworn duty of some properly
                                            constituted tribunal to make diligent inquiry and true
                                            presentment, as to the minor offences against the penal
                                            code, these offences will go unpunished, and thereby
                                            beget a disregard of law, and result in the increase of
                                            crime.</p>
                                        <p>The General Assembly has already found it necessary to
                                            restore the jurisdiction of grand juries over one class
                                            of misdemeanors, and it is not perceived why the same
                                            considerations which induced this partial return to the
                                            old system, do not require a complete restoration of the
                                            jurisdiction so long exercised by the Grand Inquests of
                                            the several counties. I therefore respectfully recommend
                                            the restoration of this jurisdiction.</p>

                                            from Europe to the United States, whilst many of the
                                            brave soldiers of Indiana, who havo been campaigning in
                                            the Southern States will doubtless seek new homes in the
                                            regions through which they have marched - These
                                            considerations render it of the highest importance that
                                            steps should be taken to attract to this State the

                                            Exposition," to be opened at Paris, France, on the
                                            1st of April, 1867. It is eminently desirable that
                                            specimens of the agricultural productions, manufactures,

                                            should be there exhibited. They would constitute the

                                            the great resources, progress, and wealth of the State,

                                            Assembly to the damages occassioned to some of our
                                            citizens, by the invasion of the State by John Morgan,
                                            in 1863, I have seen no cause for changing the views
                                            expressed on this subject in my regular message
                                            delivered at the commencement of your last session, and
                                            therefore repeat the recommendation therein made.</p>

                                        <p>The first section of Article Eight of our State
                                            Constitution provides as follows: ''Knowledge
                                            and learning, generally diffused throughout a community,
                                            being essential to the preservation of a free
                                            government, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly
                                            to encourage by all suitable means, moral, intellectual,
                                            scientific, and agricultural improvement; and to provide
                                            by law for a general and unitorm system of common
                                            schools, wherein tuition shall be without charge, and
                                            equally open to all." The language of this
                                            provision is very broad, and would seem, in letter and
                                            in spirit, to embrace all the children in the State
                                            without regard to color. Surely it can not be denied
                                            that as we have a colored population in our midst, it is
                                            our interest independent of those considerations of
                                            natural justice and humanity which plead so strongly, to
                                            educate and elevate that population. An ignorant and
                                            degraded element is a burden and injury to society,
                                            whatever may be its color. It therefore becomes a matter
                                            of sound political economy, as well as absolute justice,
                                            that whatever colored population we may have should be
                                            educated, and enabled to become intelligent, industrious
                                            and useful members of the community. It is also
                                            especially important at this time, when the President of
                                            the United States and the people of the North are
                                            requiring the people of the South to make provision for
                                            educating their colored population, and protecticg them
                                            in the enjoyment of civil rights, that the Northern
                                            States should set the example, and practice what they
                                            preach, by extending to their smaller colored population
                                            the rights and benefits which they demand for them from
                                            others.</p>
                                        <p>The laws of lndiana exclude colored children from the
                                            common schools, and make no provision whatever for their
                                            education. I would therefore recommend that the laws be
                                            so amended as to require an enumeration to be made of
                                            the <hi rend="i">colored</hi> children of the State, and
                                            such a portion of the School Fund as may be in
                                            proportion to their number, be set apart and applied to
                                            their education by the establishment of separate
                                            schools, under such suitable provisions and regulations
                                            as may be deemed proper. I would not recommend that
                                            white and colored children be placed together in the
                                            same schools, believing, as I do, in the present state
                                            of public opinion, that to do so, would create
                                            dissatisfaction and conflict, and impair the usefulness
                                            of the schools. I am informed that a system can be
                                            devised, by which separate schools for the education of
                                            colored children can be sucessfully maintained in
                                            various parts of the State, <pb n="32" xml:id="VAA8558-08-032"/>and believe that justice,
                                            humanity, and sound policy require that it should be
                                            done.</p>
                                        <p>By the school law of 1865, negroes and mulattoes are not
                                            taxed for the support of common schools, but if colored
                                            schools should be established this law should be so
                                            amended as to subject them to like taxation with white
                                            persons for educational purposes.</p>

                                        <p>In my Message to the Legislature at the last session, I
                                            held the following language in regard to the admission
                                            of the testimony of colored persons in cases in which
                                            white persons are parties:</p>
                                        <p>"The statute which excludes negroes from testifying
                                            in courts of justice, in cases in which white persons
                                            are parties, is, in my opinion, a stigma upon the
                                            humanity and intelligence ef the State, The idea that
                                            the white race must be protected against the colored, by
                                            imposing on them this disability, is absurd, and has
                                            been made the cover and protection for much crime and
                                            injustice. As the law stands, murder may be perpetrated
                                            with impunity by white persons in the presence only of
                                            colored witnesses; and it is well known that negroes are
                                            often employed by white persons as the instruments of
                                            crime and fraud, because of their inability to testify
                                            in courts of justice. The interests of both races demand
                                            that this disability be removed; and if the fact of
                                            color affects credibility, that can be referred to the
                                            court and jury as in other cases, and would undoubtedly
                                            receive due consideration. Indiana and Illinois are the
                                            only free States whose statute books are dishonored by
                                            the retention of a law so repugnant to the spirit of the
                                            age and the dictates of common sense."</p>
                                        <p>I can add nothing to the force of what I have before
                                            said, but desire again earnestly to recommend the repeal
                                            of this obnoxious statute. It is due, however, to the
                                            State of Illinois, to say that her statute book is no
                                            longer disgraced by this law, and that Indiana has the
                                            bad eminence of being the only State in the North that
                                            retains it.</p>

                                        <p>The part which Indiana has taken in the war for the
                                            suppression of the rebellion, is a matter upon which the
                                            citizens of the State may justly pride themselves.</p>
                                        <p>In the number of troops furnished, and in the amount of
                                            voluntary contributions rendered, Indiana, in proportion
                                            to her population and wealth, stands equal to any of her
                                            sister Spates. It is also a subject of gratitude and
                                            thankfulness that, whilst the number of troops furnished
                                            by Indiana alone in this great contest, would have done
                                            credit to a first class nation,measured by the standard
                                            of previous wars, not a single regiment, battery, or
                                            battalion, from this State, has brought reproach upon
                                            the national flag, and no disaster of the war can be
                                            traced to any want of fidelity, courage, or efficiency
                                            on the part of any Indiana officer.</p>
                                        <p>The endurance, heroism, intelligence, and skill of the
                                            officers and soldiers sent forth by Indiana to do battle
                                            for the Union, have shed a luster on our beloved State
                                            of which any people might justly be proud. Without
                                            claiming superiority over our loyal sister States, it is
                                            but justice to the brave men who have represented us on
                                            almost every battle-field of tha war, to say that their
                                            deads have placed Indiana in the front rank of those
                                            heroic States which rushed to the rescue of the
                                            imperiled Government of the Nation.</p>
                                        <p>The total number of troops furnished by the State for all
                                            terms of service in the armies of the Union, exceeds two
                                            hundred thousand men, much the greater portion of these
                                            being for three years; and in addition to this, not less
                                            than fifty thousand State militia have from time to time
                                            been called into active service to repel rebel raids and
                                            defend our southern border from invasion, all of which
                                            will be fully shown in the official report of the
                                            Adjutant General, now in course of preparation for
                                            publication.</p>
                                        <p>Since the end of the war, all the Indiana troops have
                                            been mustered out of service except eighteen regiments
                                            of infantry, and three regiments of cavalry. Every
                                            effort consistent with the interests of the Government
                                            has been made by the Executive Department of the State
                                            to procure the early muster out of these remaining
                                            Indiana regiments, and assurances have been received
                                            that orders for their discharge will be issued as soon
                                            as their services can be dispensed with. For other
                                            interesting details relating to our troops, you are
                                            respectfully referred to a communication from the
                                            Adjutant General herewith submitted.</p>

                                        <p>Since the adjournment of the Legislature the civil war
                                            which had desolated our country has terminated in the
                                            complete triumph of the Government and the suppression
                                            of the rebellion. The evacuation of Richmond, and the
                                            capitulation of Lee's army, were rapidly followed
                                            by the surrender of every other rebel army in the field,
                                            and irregular guerrilla warfare almost entirely passed
                                            away in a few weeks. The suppression of the rebellion
                                            and the subjugation of armed rebels seems to be
                                            complete, while every rebel State has confessed to the
                                            irretrievable destruction of the institution of slavery.
                                            The people of the South have been beaten and overpowered
                                            in tho fieId; they have wholly lost their property in
                                            slaves; much of their country has been overrun and made
                                            desolate by the march and ravage of great armies;
                                            poverty and wretchedness have been brought home to large
                                            classes who before had lived in wealth and luxury; large
                                            numbers of their population have perished in the
                                            conflict, and there is prevailing among them great
                                            exasperation and bitterness which time alone can
                                            assuage.</p>
                                        <p>The great majority, however, appear to regard the verdict
                                            of the war as irreversible, and to promptly accept the
                                            situation as one they cannot modify or put aside. But
                                            while the heresy of State sovereignty has been
                                            extirpated, and the questions involved in the conflict
                                            settled by the arbitrament of arms, it is yet of the
                                            greatest importance to the nation that these questions
                                            be adjudicated and determined by the highest judicial
                                            tribunal, which might most appropriately be done in the
                                            trial, for high treason and other atrocious crimes, of
                                            the chief instigator and head of this most wicked and
                                            bloody rebellion, It should be definitely <pb n="33" xml:id="VAA8558-08-033"/> established as a principle
                                            in our Constitution, both by judicial decision and
                                            example of punishment, that rebellion is treason, that
                                            treaaon is a crime which may not be committed with
                                            impunity; and that there is but one sovereinty which
                                            resides in the collective and undivided people of the
                                            United States.</p>
                                        <p>The work of reorganizing the Governments of the rebel
                                            States, and bringing them again into practical relations
                                            with the Government and people of the United States, is
                                            now upon the country, and demands for its successful
                                            performance the greatest wisdom, patience, and
                                            forbearance.</p>
                                        <p>But while it is important that the work of reorganization
                                            shall not be unnecessarily delayed, it is more important
                                            that it shall proceed upon sound principles, which will
                                            furnish guarantees for the future integrity and peace of
                                            the Republic. The principal discussion which arise on
                                            this subject pertain to the future status of the negro
                                            in the Southern States. By some it is urged that
                                            conferring suffrage upon him shall be made a condition
                                            of reorganization, or in other words that the States
                                            lately in rebellion shall not be permitted to resume
                                            their practical relations with the Government, except
                                            upon the terms of first conferring the rights of
                                            suffrage upon their freedmen. As to the manner in which
                                            this measure shall be accomplished, the friends of it
                                            differ. Some are in favor of persistently excluding the
                                            members of Congress from the Southern States, until
                                            negro suffrage has been incorporated into their several
                                            State Constitutions. Others assume that the States
                                            lately in rebellion are no longer members of the Union,
                                            but have forfeited and lost their character as States,
                                            and are in fact held as conquered provinces, and, like
                                            unorganized territories which may have been acquired by
                                            the Government, are under the complete control and
                                            jurisdiction of Congress, which may confer suffrage upon
                                            whomsoever it pleases.The subject of suffrage is, by the
                                            national Constitution, expressly referred to the
                                            determination of the several States, and it can not be
                                            taken from them without a violation of the letter and
                                            spirit of that instrument.</p>
                                        <p>But without stopping to discuss theories or questions of
                                            Constitutional law, and leaving them out of view, it
                                            would, in my opinion, be unwise to make the work of
                                            reconstruction depend upon a condition of such doubtful
                                            utility as negro suffrage.</p>
                                        <p>It is a fact so manifest, that it should not be called in
                                            question by any, that a people who are just emerging
                                            from the barbarism of slavery are not qualified to
                                            become a part of our political system, and take part,
                                            not only in the government of themselves and their
                                            neighbors, but of the whole United States. So for from
                                            believing that negro suffrage is a remedy for all of our
                                            national ills, I doubt whether it is a remedy for any,
                                            and rather believe that its enforcement by Congress
                                            would be more likely to subject the negro to a merciless
                                            persecution, than to confer upon him any substantial
                                            benefit. By some it is thought that suffrage is already
                                            cheap enough in this country; and the immediate transfer
                                            of more than half a milIion of men from the bonds of
                                            slavery, with all theignorance and degradation upon them
                                            which the slavery of generations upon Southern fields
                                            has produced, would be a declaration to the world that
                                            the exercise of American suffrage involves no
                                            intellectual or moral qualificatioas, and that there is
                                            no difference between an American freemen and and an
                                            American slave, which may not be removed by a mere act
                                            of Congress. What is far more important to the freedmen
                                            than suffrage, is that their several States shall give
                                            them the right to testify in courts of justice, afford
                                            to them the ordinary judicial machinery for the
                                            protection of their civil rights, provide for their
                                            education, and thus enable them to qualify themselves
                                            for the higher political duties of the citizen. It is
                                            not less vital to their interests, that the
                                            Constitutional Amendment be adopted, which not only
                                            forever prohibits slavery throughout the nation, but
                                            confers upon Congress the power of legislating for the
                                            protection of their liberty and their civil rights; and
                                            these things, among others, the President of the United
                                            States has imposed as precedent conditions in the work
                                            of reorganization, and has declared his purpose to hold
                                            and govern these States by military authority, as in a
                                            state of war, until they have been complied with. Time,
                                            and the influence of the new conditions by which they
                                            are surrounded, will elevate the condition of one race,
                                            and soften the prejudices and asperities of the other,
                                            and will accomplish what legislation and violent
                                            political changes can not. The inevitable presence of
                                            both races upon the same soil, the demands and
                                            necessities of capital and labor, and the unavoidable
                                            community of interest, will, in process of time, I cam
                                            not doubt, force a reciprocity of rights and privileges.
                                            The institution of slavery was so closely intertwined
                                            about the foundation of society in the Southern States,
                                            that, when it was destroyed, society was uprooted and
                                            broken to pieces. The process of its reconstruction is
                                            but beginning, but it is very certain that the new
                                            structure will differ, in most essential particulars,
                                            from the old. Free labor, free speech and free schools,
                                            will come into it as new and powerful elements of change
                                            and progress, and large emigration from the Northern
                                            States and from Europe, bringing commerce, manufactures
                                            and improved agriculture, will exert a modifying and
                                            beneficial influence, the effect of which can hardly be
                                            over-estimated.</p>
                                        <p>Another amendment, not only conducive to the interests of
                                            the freedmen, but demanded by the rights and interests
                                            of the white people of the North, should be made,
                                            changing the basis of representation in Congress and the
                                            apportionment of political power, among the several
                                            States. The present provision ia the Constitution of the
                                            United States concerning this, reads as follows:
                                            "Representatives and direct taxes shall be
                                            apportioned among the several States, which may be
                                            included within this Union, by adding to the number of
                                            free persons, including those that may be bound to
                                            service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not
                                            taxed, three fifths of all other persons." The
                                            phrase, "<hi rend="i">three fifths</hi> of all
                                            other prisons," was a periphrastic description of
                                            the slave population, and gave representation for <pb n="34" xml:id="VAA8558-08-034"/> three fifths of
                                            their number. By the abolition of slavery the population
                                            is added to the "number of free persons," and
                                            thus increases the basis of representation by the
                                            addition of two fifths.</p>
                                        <p>The inequality produced between the several States by
                                            this form of representation, is too palpable to require
                                            agument. By its operation, eight million of white people
                                            in the Southern States, hold, and exercise political
                                            power, full sixty per cent. greater than an equal number
                                            of white people in the Northern States, by reason of
                                            having in their midst four and a half millions of
                                            negroes. This provision was the chief compromise which
                                            our fathers made wiith the institution of slavery, and.
                                            although, through a sense of its great injustice, it has
                                            been impatiently acquiesced in by the Northern people,
                                            yet it has been carried out in good faith; but now that
                                            slavery, the foundation of this compromise, has passed
                                            away, the provision should be so changed as to suit the
                                            altered conditon of the country, and do justice to every
                                            part of the nation. If it were so amended as to
                                            apportion representation and political power among the
                                            several States according to the actual number of male
                                            voters over the age of twenty-one years, it would be
                                            equally fair for all, and would put it out of the power
                                            of the people of any State, or class of States, to
                                            increase or double their political power by the presence
                                            in their midst of a population which they themselves
                                            deprive of all political rights; and thus inducements
                                            would be presented to the several States, in order to
                                            enlarge their power in the Government, to confer
                                            political rights upon every class of persons, without
                                            regard to color or nationality, as rapidly as might be
                                            deemed consistent with their true interests.</p>
                                        <p>By the census of 1860, the fifteen slave States were
                                            allowed eighty-four (84) members of Congress, because of
                                            the representation of three-fifths of their slaves, and
                                            now that the slaves are made free, and the other
                                            two-fifths added to to their basis of representation,
                                            they would be entitled to fourteen members more,
                                            although perhaps in point of law this increase cannot
                                            take place anterior to the year 1870. If the negro
                                            population was equally differed throughout all the
                                            States, this inequality would not exist, but the fact
                                            is, it is not so diffused, and the probability is that
                                            the concentration in the Southern States will become
                                            greater from year to year by the emigration thither of
                                            the colored population of the North. According to the
                                            census of 1860, the Southern States upon a white basis
                                            would have been entitled to sixty-six members of
                                            Congress, instead of eighty-four according to the
                                            existing basis.</p>
                                        <p>Whatever opposition there may be to the adoption of this
                                            proposed amendment, it amounts, when stripped of its
                                            coverings and sophistries, simply to this: that the
                                            white people of the South shall continue to exercise in
                                            the future, as in the past, sixty per cent. more of
                                            political power in the National Government, than an
                                            equal number of white people in the North, and for this
                                            great inequality and injustice I am wholly unable to
                                            perceive any good or sufficient reason.</p>
                                        <p>Should such an amendment be passed by the requisite
                                            majorities through the Congress of the United States,
                                            before yoor final adjournment I would most respectfully,
                                            but earnestly, recommend its immediate ratification on
                                            your part.</p>
                                        <p>In conclusion upon this subject, I am not of the opinion
                                            that the herculean work of reconstruction will be
                                            accomplished at one time, by any general and sweeping
                                            process, but that it will proceed State by State, as
                                            each one shall conform to the requirements of the
                                            Government, and show itself loyal and prepared to resume
                                            its practical relations in the Union. The conditions
                                            which have been imposed upon these States by the
                                            President, are not only reasonable and legitimate, but
                                            are dictated by justice and a wise foresight for the
                                            future of the Republic, and although they may not be
                                            accepted this year, or even the next, yet that they
                                            ultimately will be I have no doubt. And if the work of
                                            reorganization shall be successfully completed within
                                            the same period which was required to put down the
                                            rebellion, it will be within the limit of my
                                            expectations.</p>

                                        <p>The war has established upon imperishable foundations,
                                            the great, fundamental truth of the unity and
                                            indivisibility of the nation. We are many States, but
                                            one people, having one undivided sovereignty, one flag,
                                            and one common destiny. It has also established, to be
                                            confessed by all the world, the exalted character of the
                                            American soldier, his matchless valor, his
                                            self-sacrificing patriotism, his capacity to endure
                                            fatigues and hardships, and his humanity, which in the
                                            midst of carnage has wreathed his victorious
                                            achievements with a brighter glory.</p>
                                        <p>He has taught the world a lesson before which it stands
                                            in amazement, how, when the storm of battle had passed,
                                            he could lay aside his arms, put off the habiliments of
                                            war, and return with cheerfulness to the gentle pursuits
                                            of peace, and show how the bravest of soldiers could
                                            become the best of citizens.</p>
                                        <p>To the Army and Navy, under the favor of Providence, we
                                            owe the preservation of our country, and the fact that
                                            we have to-day a place, and the proudest place, among
                                            the nations.</p>
                                        <p>Let it not be said of us, as it was said in olden time,
                                            that "Republics are ungrateful." Let us honor
                                            the dead, cherish the living, and preserve in immortal
                                            memory the deeds and virtues of all, as an inspiration

                        <p>Mr. Kilgore's bill [H. R, No. 34] to amend the 18th section of the
                            act regulating descents and the apportionment of estates, coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. There was a report on this bill by the <orgName>Judiciary

                        <p>It provides that if there be children or their descendants of the first

                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. If he recollected aright, in the discussion of the bill at
                            the last session, he had come to the conclusion that it would not effect
                            the object he had intended, he therefore would move its indefinite
                            postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER thought it right in principle as it now stands. When there are
                            no heirs from her former husband, the title vests with the widow, and
                            she can convey; but when there ara heirs9 she can not.</p>
                        <p>Mr COFFROTH explained the law, showing that it was already ample upon
                            this subject. The bill simply proposes to allow the widow to do what the
                            law already allows.</p>
                        <p>The bill and pending amendment were then indefinitely postponed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Miller's bill [H. R. 101] to entitle County Recorders to their
                            fees in advance, and compensate them for indexing entry bookscoming up
                            with a favorable recommendation from the <orgName>Committee on Fees and
                                Salaries</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. There was perhaps no county officer better paid than the
                            Recorder, and he objected to raising their compensation in this way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. The object of the bill was to enable Recorders to demand
                            their fees in advance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THATCHER said the committee report was unanimous for its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN made a statement of the object of the bill. The Recorder shall
                            not be compelled to record papers till his legal fees are advanced. He
                            thought, it was right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS, There were many who, if their deeds were on record, cared
                            nothing for their title deeds. The cbject of the law was to enable the
                            Recorder to protect himself from such as never remove their deeds from
                            his office.</p>
                        <p>Mr.SHUEY thought the friends of the bill were seeking a little too much.
                            If they would not increase the compensation, it would not be
                            exceptionable. This pay for the indexing was the objection. He would
                            strike out this indirect way of raising salaries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH believed the office of County Recorder, instead of being the
                            best, was almost the poorest of county offices. But still, he objected
                            to his going into the county treasury for compensation for indexing,
                            though it would be right to require indexes. The bill might be
                            amended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES gave his experience as a County Recorder. He had not been able
                            to collect his fee bills. He was in favor of the bill - would allow the
                            Recorder power to demand hs fees before he does the work.</p>
                        <p>The House rejected the motion to postpone affirmative 33, negative
                            48.</p>

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said the gentleman's amendment would not give one for
                            each county. The object of the committee was to establish an odd number.
                            It was not improbable that the bill would be rejected at last.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS demanded a division of the question.The House refused to

                        <p>So the amendment was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed. He read the
                            constitutional provision, going to show that it did not look to a
                            diminution of the number.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB believed a reduction of the number would be an improvement in
                            legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASALLE deprecated haste in making any change in the State
                            organization. Indiana was now a large State - with a population of
                            perhaps nearly 2,000,000, The spirit of our government looked to a fell
                            and free representation of the people. He was satisfied that the people
                            everywhere desired that every county sacnld be specially represented in
                            the General Assembly. He admitted the advantages of deliberation and
                            efficiency in smaller deliberative bodies, but could not forego his
                            regard for the principle stated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. Free and full representation was tho life-blood of a republic,
                            and this would be taking a backward step.</p>
                        <p>The smaller counties would be especially dissatisfied with such a
                            measure. He was in favor of indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY, to give time for further deliberation on this bill, moved

                                    <p>WHEREAS, Jefferson Davis, late President of the so-called
                                        Confederate States is now, and has been, for months past, in

                                        crime, and the demands of the loyal people of this State, we
                                        respectfully request His Excellency, Andrew Johnson,
                                        Presidest of the United States, that the said Jefferson
                                        Davis, for his alleged treason, be speedily brought to trial
                                        before the proper civil tribunal, and if convicted, that he
                                        stall suffer the penalty prescribed by law.</p>

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. I am satisfied with the first part, but with the latter I
                            am not. The President of the United States ought to be allowed to
                            exercise the powers he may have without interference. I move to strike
                            out that part of the resolution which requests the President to cause
                            the sentence that may be passed to be speedily executed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNEIT. That resolution is simply expressinh our opinions. Southern
                            Legislatures and Conventions have been passing resolutions begging that
                            Jeff. Davis may not be tried, and this and that and the other prominent
                            rebel may be pardoned, &amp;c, and I think the State of Indiana has some
                            stack in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. I think the resolution ought to to be amended as proposed. The
                            pardoning power is one of great importance, given to the President to be
                            exercised at his discretion. This is one of those peculiar cases of
                            which the President can judge better than any one in the State of
                            Indiana. I have no doubt when Mr. Davis is tried and convicted, if tried
                            at all, that the President of the United States will pardon him; and we
                            ought to leave the President free to act; for he takes the
                            responsibility in this matter.</p>
                        <p>The action of this Legislature ought not to have ary influence with him
                            it ought not to have a feather's weight. I would like to see a
                            judicial investigation of Mr. Davis' case, for it might be of
                            advantage in the future. There are thousands of men - I may say hundreds
                            of thousands - equally guilty with him. Almost every man in the Southern
                            States before the rebellion was crushed, sympathized with him in the
                            Southern rebellion. We have got to forgive; it is a matter of necessity;
                            but we should set before the country a record that will be a warning to
                            future generations - that such persons subject themselves to the
                            scaffold. Public policy, humanity, and everything connected with the
                            true spirit of human nature, require us not to administer technical law
                            upon this people. Mr. Davis only acted as an instrument to carry out the
                            sentiments of a large proportion of that people.</p>

                            disposed to stir up the vindictive spirit of Republican members; but if
                            peace has been declared, and we are subject to civil law, let us leave
                            the matter entirely in the hands of the civil law. If, on every hand is
                            to be met the vindictive spirit manifested by the Republican party in
                            regard to many other persons subject to trial and execution for alleged
                            offences of law, where, upon the broad face of tho earth, with that
                            spirit prevailing, could Mr. Davis recieve an impartial trial? He might
                            as well, without trial, submit to execution. I trust this vindictive
                            spirit may not be manifested throughout this seesion, but that we <pb n="38" xml:id="VAA8558-08-038"/> may hold to the common virtues of
                            charity, banality and courtesy, in connection with justice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. It is a little strange that in this age of the world men are
                            awakening to such a realizing sense of the virtues of charity and mercy.
                            On every hand we have presented arguments and claims for pardon and
                            mercy for the greatest criminals the world ever knew. It is all right
                            when our Southern brethren from every legislative assembly are
                            beseeching the Presidant with their petitions for the pardon of these
                            men who for four long years have been in rebellion and committed the
                            foulest acts of treason known to civilized history. If they stopped at
                            that, the appeal for mercy and charity might obtain; but I ask Senators
                            and the assembled universe to look at the crimes and outrages committed
                            by these men, outside of their legitimate acts of rebellion, so to
                            speak. If Davis is not to be brought to trial, and if convicted, his
                            sentence is not to be carried out, we have a recent judicial murder in
                            the case of Captain Wirz. While I believe he suffered a just penalty for
                            his crimes, I believe Jeff. Davis is a greater criminal than he.</p>
                        <p>I have as much confidence in the sense of justice of President Johnson as
                            any other man; but as he himself has said, he is a man subject to all
                            the frailties of mankind, and he can be influenced by the views of his
                            fellow-citizens. An effort is made on every hand to influence him in one
                            direction, and I ask why should not the voice of the loyal State of
                            Indiana be heard in this matter? We owe a duty to law and order, nand it
                            is important that it should be settled now, once and forever, that crime
                            can not go unwhipped of justice in this land. [Applause in the
                            lobby.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING. I must acknowledge that whenever any personage connected
                            with the terrible rebellion which has scourged this Country is spoken
                            of, it excites my anger and all the malice there is in me. And while I
                            admit we ought to be charitable, and mercy ought to be extended to the
                            great mass of the Southern peopleand I am proud that President Johnson
                            has adopted the policy he has in reference to Southern gentlemen of
                            distinction - still I am anxious if Jeff. Davis is convicted that the
                            sentence of the law shall be executed upon him. The Constitution
                            declares that a party guilty of treason shall suffer death. This arch
                            traitor, Jeff. Davis, has been one of the prime instigators of the
                            hellish rebellion which has scourged this country and which is
                            burthening the people thereof with taxes. What Senator is to stand here
                            in defence of this infernal being who is yet permitted to breathe, and
                            offer an apology for his conduct in bringing thousands to an untimely
                            grave by cruelty that would disgrace an Indian?</p>
                        <p>To this arch-traitor may be charged the death of thousands of brave and
                            patriotic men, brought to an untimely grave in the prison pens of
                            Andersonville, and yet men and women - she rebels and she devils
                            [applause in the lobby - repressed by the chair,] if I may be allowed
                            the languageare petitioning the President of the United States to pardon
                            this traitor. I have confidence in Andrew Johnson, yet he is but a man,
                            and we have the right to say to him, if Davis is tried and convicted,
                            let the sentence of the law be executed. If he were a day laborer or a
                            respectable farmer who had committed an act of treason, and for that
                            tried and condemned, you would not hear of legislatures and public
                            bodies in the Southern States petitioning the President of the United
                            States to pardon him. It is proper, if convicted, that he should be
                            executed; that the nations of the earth should know the people of the
                            United States are true to themselves, true to the cause of their
                            country, true to mercy, and true to justice in behalf of those who have
                            sacrificed their lives for the support of the Constitution. As a general
                            thing, I trust, indeed I know, there is no malice in me. I am in favor
                            of charity toward those persons as a mass, but if I could see Davis hung
                            ninety and nine times, he would not receive the punishment he should
                            receive for causing our soldiers to perish by his bad conduct. I hope
                            the resolution will pass. [Renewed applause in the lobbies]</p>
                        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. The Doorkeeper will keep order in the lobbies.
                            These demonstrations are entirely improper and will not be
                            tolerated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. While I have implicit confidence in tbe President of the
                            United States, I would not destroy this resolution by the substitute. I
                            have differed with President Johnson on the punishment of these rebels
                            from tbe beginning. He, however, can judge what should be done better
                            than I. I have ever thought, since the capture of Davis - he being the
                            head, and under whose authority these other men have acted - that he is
                            the man that ought to have been first tried and first executed. Since
                            everything has become calm - and I am glad of it - there seems to be a
                            disposition to look with mercy upon these parties, but it seems to me
                            the enormity of their crimes speak to us in thunder tones, and demand of
                            us an expression of our opinion on this important subject. I shall
                            therefore vote for this resolution, believing it to be the voice of the
                            people I represent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA As this resolution, Mr. President, embraces one of the most
                            serious questions now before the country, I hope it will be referred to
                            a committee. I do not think it should be disposed of in an hour. We
                            should take time to weigh it carefully. For myself, I have no desire to
                            speak now - indeed, I have no wish to speak at any time on this
                            question, in the presence of the inflamed passions of a mob. I desire to
                            address myself wholly and exclusively to the ear of Christian
                            civilization. Gentlemen on the other side of the House may think this a
                            light matter. I cannot view it in that light. I think, sir, it sustains
                            intimate relations to the whole civilization of the country and the
                            world. I hope Senators on the Republican side will present their views
                            fully, and we will present ours. We are not afraid of the question, and
                            hope they are not. I therefore trust the friends of the measure will
                            agree to the reference - let them present their report, and we will
                            present ours. I move to refer the resolution and the substitute, to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES said that the leading object in tha trial and punishment of
                            criminals is the protection offered to the public. Without it society
                                <pb n="39" xml:id="VAA8558-08-039"/> would fall into chaos, and he
                            thought that the greatest criminal of the centuries ought not to escape
                            wirh impunity. The hanging of Mrs. Surratt had fixed an indelible stigma
                            on female traitors and conspirators. The execution of Wirz, worthless as
                            was his life, had erected a bulwark of protection around prisoners of
                            war for all coming time. Davis was the embodied head of the only
                            rebellion against freedom that the world has ever seen, and as a
                            guarantee of peace and freedom in the future, he would try him as a
                            traitor and, if convicted, would, as Mr. Johnson once told him in the
                            Senate, hang him as a traitor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. Talking about this matter creates excitement in the minds of
                            Senators, but not, so much as it would two months ago. While gentlemen
                            cry out for the distruction of a certain class of people, and for
                            carrying destruction to every family in a certain section of the
                            country, they should recognize the fact that this kind of feeling is
                            rapidly passing away. I thank God that I stand not as I stood in the
                            Senate Chamber a short time ago, but that; now we can talk to a people
                            that are beginning to reason again, notwithstanding I feel that.
                            Senators have shown that they are controlled by passion rather than
                            otherwise. And again, there was a time when a diversity of opinion
                            prevailed in regard to capital punishment, and it would be well enough
                            to look if that opinion is changed. For these and other reasons the
                            motion of the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Hanne] is a good one. I have no
                            doubt of the information I have received that Mr. Lincoln declared in
                            divers conversations, of one of which I have no doubt, that he would not
                            have Jeff. Davis executed; and he gave tha best reason for it I have yet
                            heard. Mr. Lincoln said it would do no good, and much harm ; for the
                            Southern people would turn find severally ask themselves: "Why am I
                            not executed too?" It is a question more of public policy than
                            possibly anything else. We have a distracted country yet, though the
                            rebels in the South have submitted and are anxious to return, to their
                            allegiance. Then it becomes a question what will best restore peace and
                            quiet in the South, and produce that state of feeling which obtained at
                            an earlier period? Now true and genuine statesmanship is demanded more
                            than at any other time in the history of our country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT (interrupting). I have listened to the gentlemen through two
                            speeches, and now he is certainly not discussing the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON. I hope the Senator will be permitted to go on, I think
                            every Senator here should have a right to defend his friends.
                            [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. Complimentary, indeed! I thank the Senator from Marion for his
                            compliment.</p>
                        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. I believe other Senators have discussed the main
                            question - the Senator from Lawrence will proceed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. As I was saying, I have no doubt, if Mr. Lincoln had lived
                            until today, that there would have been a proclamation issued liberating
                            all political peisoners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING, (interposing.) I desire to ask the Senator, with whom was
                            this conversation held? I have never heard of it before.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, I will answer the Senator when I get ready. Although I
                            don't know that I ought to make public a confidential
                            conversation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING. Then I withdraw the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. No amount of discussion would change tho sentiment of any
                            Senator here, and as no good can came by postponement, why refer this
                            matter? I do not know of a single instance in which that arch traitor
                            execised mercy toward any one. The hisory of the world shows no parallel
                            for the crimes committed by the sanction of Jefferson Davis. He stands
                            before the country not only as an arch traitor, but as one lost to all
                            feelings of humanity. I spurn the idea that you can bring in humanity to
                            bear upon the question of pardoning traitors. It may be policy to pardon
                            the masses of them, but to the leaders little mercy should be shown.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK. There seems to be a feeling that the main question shall
                            be discussed, and I hope the matter will be referred, although I do not
                            know that there is another Republican member in favor of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT I hope the resolution will not be referred. I think we are as
                            well prepared to vote now as we will be at any other time. The Senator
                            from Lawrence is all at once enamored of Mr. Lincoln and his merciful
                            policy; although the Senator from Wells talks about the vindictiveness
                            of the Republican party towards these rebels. If the Senator from
                            Lawrence were to tell me that hee heard this conversation with Mr.
                            Lincoln, I would give some consideration to it, and would want to
                            cross-question him closely; but when he gives it in the vague style he
                            does, I can not but question it. A few months ago these gentlemen were
                            loud in their denunciation of military courts, and they demanded civil
                            courts. This resolution offers that to them, and now they still want
                            these rebels tried by these civil courts, but they don't want them
                            punished. But there is one reason why I could wish Jeff. Davis pardoned.
                            I do not wish to deprive gentleman of that party of the chance to
                            nominate him for President in 1868 [Laughter.] They hava tried the

                            the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_059">H. R. No. 59</ref>] for an act to
                            authorize railroad companies to occupy and use for railroad purposes the
                            property of canal companies, with their consent, and to secure them in
                            such occupation, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The bill being read the third time - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT in explanation of his vote, said, that he occupied a peculiar
                            position on this question. When he came into this body at the last
                            session, he had never heard of the intention of constructing a railroad
                            along the White River Canal. He only learned the fact, when the bill was
                            introduced into the House, although he had been in all parts of the
                            district during the campaign. He found upon examination of the journals
                            of 1863, that his predecessor, a citizen of Fayette county, and well
                            informed of all the rights of both the Canal and Railroad Company, and
                            the wishes of the people in respect thereto, had voted against the same.
                            He examined the bill closely, and did not like its provisions, because
                            he saw that it conveyed to Mr. Lord, all the property, privileges and
                            franchises or the canal, without requiring of him a single obligation in
                            return. He is to pay nothing, and agrees to do nothing. He is not
                            required to construct a road to any place, or at any time. Nor does he
                            agree to protect the water power. He had then a consultation with Mr.
                            Trusler, the member of the House. They agreed that their constituents
                            were probably divided on the subject, and that they would divide the
                            vote by Trusler voting for the bill in the House, he residing in
                            Fayette, and that he, residing in Union, should vote against the bill in
                            the Senate. About that time a remonstrance was sent here from Fayette
                            county, signed by the leading men of the county, including the lessees
                            of water power on the canal, asking that the bill be defeated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Trussler, in pursuance of their understanding, voted for the bill in
                            the House. But before the bill came up in the Senate, Mr. Trusler, who
                            had been to Fayette county since his vote on the bill, moved in the
                            House for permission to change his vote, alleging as a reason, that the
                            people of Fayette county were earnestly opposed to the bill. Mr. Bennett
                            then wrote to leading men of Fayette county to ascertain the wishes of
                            the citizens, and in every case he was answered that they opposed the
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Then he thought his coarse was plainly indicated. His predecessor voted
                            against it, the member of the House living in Fayette, voted against if
                            the people of both counties hsd remonstrated against it; leading men had
                            advised him to oppose it; his own convictions and judgment opposed the
                            provisions of the bill; he had not heard a word in favor of it. Hence he
                            opposed the bill with earnest convictions of duty, and thought he was
                            fully representing the wishes of his constituents. But, suddenly the
                            people became aroused, and held large and respsctable meetings on the
                            sabject, and instructed him to vote for the bill. He promised in good
                            faith to do so, with only a protest against its obnoxious provisions.
                            But by a resoiution of a Republican caucus, it was resolved that, as the
                            bill called the Morton Bill, had precedence on the calendar of the
                            Sanate, no other bill should pass, until that bill passed. He considered
                            himself bound by that resolution. He had been elected as a Republican,
                            pledged to sustain the financial measures of Governor Morton, and he did
                            not, nor would not again sacrifice such a great public measure, for any
                                <pb n="41" xml:id="VAA8558-08-041"/> private interest, even if that
                            private interest was dear to his own people. Thus both bills were lost,
                            neither party yielding their caucus resolutions. But he said when he
                            went home he met his constituents in public, and explained his course,
                            and they expressed themselves as fully satisfied with it, but desired
                            him to vote for the bill, as they were anxious for the road. He did not
                            like the bill yet, but he believed the road a great public benefit, and
                            recognized the right of his constituents to instruct him on any such
                            subjects, and he should represent their wishes on this floor, and vote
                            for the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr.CORBIN was opposed to the bill from the start. He thought there was
                            danger in passing it without restrictions being placed in it. His
                            objections to the bill still remained, and he would still vote against
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then passed its final reading by yeas 38, nays 10 - </p>
                        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY (in explanation) said the legislation proposed by the bill
                            was some what of a local character, and believing it to be the wish of a
                            large majority of the people interested, he should vote aye.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES never doubted that a majority of the people interested desired
                            this road, and it has always been his intention to favor tha bill
                            whenever it should come to a vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON. I voted apainst this bill when up before somewhat in
                            opposition to my own convictions, but was influenced by the
                            representatives from that district. Since that time my mind has
                            undergone a change. The Lord himself knows - [laughter.] - the President
                            of this railroad knows, I was in favor of his road, but owing to the
                            determined opposition of some of the representatives from that section
                            of the State I opposed the bill. Since then you, yourself, I believe,
                            either at church - for we are both church members - or in the Senate
                            here, or somewhere else, told me it was nothing but a damned old canal.
                            [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>The LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR [interrupting]. I will correct the Senator. I
                            simply stated that in the opinion of some men fresh water is fit only to
                            be dammed.</p>
                        <p>Mr THOMPSON. You thought they ought to have a railroad, and now to-day I
                            will vote for it.</p>
                        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
                        <p>And so the Bill passed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB was rather indifferent as to the copies of the message, but
                            there wera accompanying documents he wanted. He desired also that the
                            history of the State debt matter embraced in the message should be
                            widely read and understood. The Governor also desired 6,000 for his own
                            use, as he understood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. We needed, he thought, a large number of copies. But at the
                            last session the words "accompanying documents" were very
                            liberally construed by the public printer, and the similar order of that
                            session had involved a very large cost.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK proposed fifty copies by way of amendment to the
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. It might not be necessary to print so many copies of the
                            accompanying documents, but he considered that 15 000 copies of the
                            message was not an extravagant number.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren, repeated that there were but few papers in the
                            State that would not publish this message, and he would commence
                            retrenchment at this point. He wanted to do some sharp financiering this
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER proposed to amend the original resolution by striking out the
                            words "accompanying documents." But 15 000 copies would not be
                            found too great a number for the message.</p>
                        <p>Mr NEWCOMB accepted tbe amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD. No man could be more favorable to economy than himself, but he
                            wanted number sufficient for the reading and filing away by every
                            citizen. It brings up important matters connected with the forgotten
                            history of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said he was informed by the printer that no document had been
                            printed without a specific order of one or the other House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER proposed 10,000.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. There is already an amendment to the amedment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN desired 20 000 The circulation of papers had been greatly
                            leased since the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS demanded a division of the question.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. There is a motion to strike out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS did not think there was any great emergency to print the
                            message at once. He would first like to know what wculd be the cost.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. lt would be about $8 50 a thousand.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER The first question will be on the largest number the
                            resolution of the gentleman from Marion.</p>

                        <p>Mr. GROVES (by unanimous consent) desired to introduce a concurrent
                            resolution to the effect that it is tbe opinion of this General Assembly
                            that Jefferson Davis, the leader of the late rebellion in the Southern
                            States, ought to be tried for high treason, and, if convicted, be
                            punished according to law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH submitted that, under a rule of the House, propositions of a
                            political character, or pertaining to Federal affairs, shall go to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>, without
                            debate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS remembered himself to have introduced such a resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr GROVES. My design in offering this is that I may get an expression of
                            the sense cf the General Assembly, in order that the people may know who
                            has been the leader of this grand rebellion which has consigned so many
                            of our noblest sons to an untimely grave; and whether their
                            representatives desire that he shall be tried and punished according to
                            law; or whether we have still in our midst men who desire that this man,
                            whom I concive to be guilty of the highest crime known to the law,
                            should go clear cf trial. There have been enough of these leaders
                            pardoned already in my opinion, and I certainly think it just that the
                            grand mover and leader of the rebellion should be brought to speedy
                            trial, and suffer according to law; and I hope that this resolution will
                            be readily adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROIH referred to page 246 of the Journal of last session for the
                            resolution to which he had referred. For one be deprecated any subject
                            of this kind coming before the House. This great criminal (Jeff. Davis)
                            stands in the same relation before tbe laws of the country with other
                            criminal; and the impropriety of giving any expression with reference to
                            his guiltiness of the high crimes preferred against him, will at once
                            suggest itself to any candid man. He was satisfied that this matter
                            would be treated properly in the hands of President Johnson and the
                            Judiciary of the United States - having full confidence in the
                            President, that he will see that the law is executed.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Newcomb in tbe chair) held that the point of order was
                            well taken, and that the resolution goes to the committee without
                            debate.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS asked and obtained leave to have read a communication from
                            Holloway, Douglas &amp; Co., proposing to furnish the daily JOURNAL at
                            the rate of eight and one-third cents per copy under the contract, which
                            the House this day authorized the Doorkeeper to make with them. Mr. H.
                            stated further the information cf the Doorkeeper, that the publishers of
                            two other papers included in the order would furnish them at the same
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART should protest against paying so high a price. He did not
                            consider these papers were of any great importance to the people. They
                            came late to the people, and prevented subscriptions, probably.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE and Mr. STUART protested against eight and one-third cents for
                            papers that were sold to carriers at three cents</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. When it is reflected upon that these papers all have
                            reporters here, it would seem but fair that they should be in some way
                            compensated for that expense. He referred to the importance of
                            sustaining these reports of the proceedings of the Legislature. There
                            was no other manner in which it could be done, except at the expense of
                            the proprietors of these papers. Is was not too high - the same price
                            was paid at the last season. He submitted the point of order, that there
                            was nothing before the House; that the House had fully disposed of this
                            matter by the previous order.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER, (Mr. Newcomb) held that the question of instructions to the
                            Doorkeeper was properly before the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE moved that the Doorkeeper be authorized to accept the
                            proposition of these publiahers. He spoke in detail, showing the
                            reasonableness of this course.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren, would not pay for the State higher for these
                            papers than he would pay for them for himself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS showed that these papers were sent to subscribers at three
                            cents per copy. He was unwilling to pay more than six cents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ABBETT was unwilling to pay eight and a third cents for papers at
                            wholesale, that he could purchase for three cents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER Since these publishers have advertised their papers for
                            three cents, to subscribers, it was absurd for the State to pay this
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH spoke generally in favor of the principle involved in the
                            motion. He had never yet heard his constituents grumble at the expense
                            of sending out information from ths Legislature. He moved to amend: by
                            authorizing the Doorkeeper to pay seven cents per copy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH argued the reasonableness of these partries charging a
                            higher price here, from the consideration that Congress pays for
                            reporting directly; that reporters were paid in the Indiana State
                            Constitutional Convention in 1850; but the State of Indiana compensated
                            reporters by taking copies of the papers. He demanded the previous
                            question, insisting that amendment to the proposition of these parties
                            was not in order. He withdrew the demand for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON, who showed that this was a question that was to decide
                            whether we will have our proceedings published or not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY said tbese publishers were compelled to report the proceedings
                            by the public demand for this information. He would authorize the
                            Doorkeeper to make a contract for these papers at a reasonable
                            price.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY renewed the demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. STRINGER and GREGORY of Warren demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH inquired whether his proposition to authorize seven cents
                            was in order.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Newcomb in the chair) held that the point of order
                            against it was well taken by the gentleman from Huntington (Mr,
                            Coffroth).</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays were then ordered and taken, resulting - yeas 37, nays

                        <head rend="center">BREVIER LIGISLATIVB REPORTS.</head>
                        <p>Mr. COBB referred a resolution reciting that on account of the expense of
                            publishing the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS, &amp;c, the same be
                            discontinued, &amp;c. - speaking at some length in favor of its passage.
                            He charged that the remarks of Senators were imperfectly reported;
                            caused, it may be, by want of time on the part of the Reporter, or it
                            may be if he reported more exteseively it would cost too much; he did
                            not pretend to say but that the Reporter was sufficiently able to report
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON was forced to concur in the remarks of the Senator from
                            Lawrence. His personal relations with the Reporter, since 1861, have
                            been of a friendly character, - he regarded him very highly - but as far
                            as the BREVIER REPORTS were concerned they are not of a character he
                            desired. He regarded this more as a want of assistance than as the fault
                            of the Reporter. Personally, he would be glad to favor the Reports, on
                            account of the Reporter himself, but felt it to be his duty to vote for
                            the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. If gentlemen complain of the Reports because they do not like
                            the appearance of their speeches when spread upon paper, it does not
                            follow that the Reporter is at fault. He was not prepared to say that
                            the Reporter is not sometimes at fault, but was prepared to say that in
                            a large majority of cases the speech-makers are at fault. There is no
                            man in the Universe that can report verbatim what is said in this Senate
                            or any other deliberative body. It can't be did. It had been his
                            fortune, or misfortune, to be occasionally heard here, and to be
                            reported occasionally by the Reporter, and he had no fault to find with
                            the Reporter. If gentlemen object to these Reports on the ground of
                            expense, that is another question. If we are to dispense with the
                            services of Reporters on the ground of expense, that would be
                            "saving at the spigot and opening at the bung hole;" but if it
                            is to be placed on the ground of the inability of the Reporter, I want
                            to be understood as entering my protest against that, right here. I
                            think the BREVIER REPORTS are a good thing; and I think as far as it is
                            possible for ordinary intelligence to report us, we have been fairly
                            reported, and consequently I am in favor of continuing these
                            Reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT had been acquainted with this Reporter since the session of
                            1859 - had read these Reports find compared them with others, and while
                            there were sometimes mistakes, whenever the Reporter's attention
                            wag called to them, they never failed to be corrected in the BREVIER
                            REPORTS. It is not expected that the Reporter will give the full
                            speeches of Senators, if he did, Senators would ba much more ashamed of
                            them than they now are. [Laughter] When Senators find they are
                            incorrectly reported, if they will call the Reporter's attention to
                            it, he will have it corrected for the BREVIER REPORTS - he does it in
                            every instance. The people twenty years hence, as well as now, have a
                            right to know what we say - and this is the only way we can perpetuate
                            it. We ought to continue these Reports - they are interesting - the
                            people read them, and take great pains to find out what their
                            representatives have said. It costs but little, and when Senators expect
                            by refusing to take these BREVIER REPORTS that they will get newspaper
                            reports as now published in the Daily <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> they are
                            mistaken. No newspaper can afford to pay enough to such a verbatim
                            reporter as Mr. Drapier is, to keep him on this floor. They can not do
                            it, sir. If you dismiss this Reporter what will you have in the place of
                            his Reports? You will have just such reports as appear in the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> now, as appeared in the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> last session, and as were printed in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> previous to that session. In 1859 the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> had this same Reporter and it had good reports. Last
                            session the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> had good reports, and this session
                            it has good reports. We want that kind of reports, and we can't get
                            them if we leave it to the newspapers to employ reporterswe have got to
                            make up their pay in some way, and what we get in these Reports is
                            valuable. These BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS we keep in our libraries
                            where they stand for years, and future generations can see in them what
                            we have done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN contended that the people were not interested in the
                            reasonings by which gentlemen here come to certain conclusions; they are
                            interested only in one thing, and that is - How do Senators vote? and
                            then - Did they vote right? When he goes home he can make known to the
                            people the reasons that governed him in giving this or that vote;
                            consequently there is no use in reporting how we argue, or what are our
                            reasoning powers. The journal showing how every Senator casts his vote,
                            is all any people ougnt to require. Although his personal relations with
                            the Reporter are of the most friendly character, he must vote against
                            the further employment of this gentleman, or any other to report simply
                            the speeches of Sanators.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, opposed the resolution - admitting that there were
                            mistakes in these Reports, but averring that they were unavoidable. It
                            is impossible for any one person to report verbatim what is said in this
                            Senate the publication of such reports no newspaper could stand. They
                            are compelled to condense them, and in the condensation of speeches, the
                            ideas gentlemen regard as containing the pith of their remarks - not so
                            regarded by the Reporter - have been left out. This had been the case
                            with himself. If gentlemen would take pains to revise their printed
                            remarks, the objection urged might be removed. I discover in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of this morning I am reported as saying that
                            if "Mr. Jefferson Davis was not pardoned by President Johnson, he
                            would have no one else to look to but to God. No other <hi rend="i">power on earth</hi> could help him." My remarks suggested the
                            opposite of what I am here reported as saying. But, sir, I can not
                            regard as altogether objectionable the language thus imputed to me. I
                            should indeed be sorry to believe that the power of God was not a power
                            exercised upon earth, for then I could <pb n="49" xml:id="VAA8558-08-049"/>conceive of no help for the local of the
                                <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Regarding this resolution seriously, I think the Senator from Lawrence,
                            [Mr. Cobb.] is rather too severe upon the Reporter and his Reports. I
                            think gentlemen will discover that the objections of last session will
                            not hold good for this, because last session the Reporter was employed
                            at the Secretary's desk, and was bothered with making up the
                            Journal. Now that his whole time is being given to reporting his Reports
                            may be more correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA. This discussion is becoming tiresome, and as several speeches
                            have been made on both sides, I move to lay the resolution on the
                            table.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN offered a resolution reciting that as the reports in the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> were not reliable, and as the reporter was
                            grossly incompetent, the contract taking such paper should be rescinded.
                            Mr. C. urged the passage of his resolution in a speech replete with
                            instances of inaccuracies in the Herald reports for the past few days.
                            In this morning's paper hardly a Senator was reported aright. He
                            closed by saying he would not insist upon the adoption of his resolution
                            just now, and was willing to let it lie on the table for the

                        <p>The question recurred on the adoption of Mr. Caldwell's
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE said it was necessary that the proprietors of papers
                            subscribed for should be required to publish all proceedings of both
                            Houses the day after they transpire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said it was idle to adopt any such proposition, because the
                            proprietors of these papers can not and will not agree to it. The cost
                            of setting the type alone would exceed the amount of the subscription
                            proposed. He saw no reason why we should not take what papers we please
                            at the subscription price. But there was no reason at all in requiring
                            the publishers to print our proceedings in full. Conversing with one of
                            these proprietors, he asked him why they could not afford papers at the
                            rate of subscription? The reply was, that the Legislature expected full
                            reports of the proceedings, which they could not afford to make; and no
                            subscriber could claim of them the right to publish an extra amount of
                            any particular kind of matter. These proprietors are obliged to hire
                            reporters at a heavy cost. One of the proprietors of the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> had told him that is would be an actual loss to them
                            to contract as proposed to the Doorkeeper yesterday, especially when
                            their loss, resulting from leaving out from one to four columns of
                            advertisements daily to make room for proceedings, was considered. It
                            was generally known that advertisements afforded the best profits of a
                            newspaper. For one, he was perfectly willing to let the matter stand as
                            the House left it yesterday.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. SHOAFF of Jay, the whole matter was laid on the
                            table.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. It was desirable to have a perfect drainage law; and the
                            machinery of this being cumbersome, he would lay the bill on the table
                            and print the bill and amendmendments. It has been thought by some that
                            the old law of 1842 was a very good law - requiring amendment only as to
                            notice.</p>

                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. We had three statutes on this subject, and he favored the
                            printing of this bill, that it might be rendered as perfect as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CALDWELL was also in favor of printing. It was impossible for new

                                R. 86.</ref>] coming up on the third reading - </p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS explained that this bill was to authorize individuals to dig a
                            canal between the two commttees, and drain a large tract of land in Lake
                            county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS explained the necessity of the bill in the existence of an
                            Illinois Canal Feeder Dam - detailing particulars in the controversy
                            therein.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, There was one thing in the bill that would command his vote,
                            viz: the allegation that the Lake county swamp land fund was stolen by a
                            set of scoundrels. [Laughter]</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH also spoke for the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE paid though he was favorable to the object of the bill, he
                            was satisfied that it contravenes the constitutional provision against
                            local legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr WOODS replied, giving particulars in the history of the Illinois
                            Calumet Feeder Dam, and the controversies involved, the controversy with
                            the State of Illinois, &amp;c. He introduced this bill, specially
                            becuase of the defiance in the matter sent over by the Legislature of
                            the State of Illinois.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said the speech of the gentleman from Lake had excited his
                            apprehension that the passage of this bill might result in a declaration
                            of war. He suggested a recommitment and further deliberation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE not yet satisfied as to the constitutional objection, moved
                            its reference to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, with
                            instructions to inquire into its constitutionality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER waived the constitutional question and supported the bill
                            from a consideration of the protection which the State owes to her
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. If he were never so ardent a friend of the bill he would
                            prefer that it should be referred, because the Chairman of the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, who haas examined it, says
                            that it is very defectively drawn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS then acquiesced in the reference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said the instruction should go to the extent that the
                            Committee should perfect the bill so as to avoid the constitutional
                            objection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE assented, accepting the modification.</p>
                        <p>And so the bill was referred.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURNES made a formal report from the <orgName>Committee on Engrossed

                            unanimous consent of the House to call up his bill [H. R. No. 156]
                            imposing on the Clerks of the several Circuit Courts the duty of
                            preparing applications for back pay, for back pay and bounties, half pay
                            and bounties, half pay and pensions; creating a State Agent for
                            soldiers' claims to represent the same; imposing on certain

                            and imposing penalties for violating their duties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. P. said he desired to make it a special order. In consequence of
                            events since the time when he introduced this bill, which have brought
                            about a state of peace, it was important that some amendments should be
                            made to this bill. He would first move that the vote ordering the
                            engrossment of the bill be reconsidered, and then he would ask that it
                            be made the special order for Wednesday next at ten o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS moved that the vote ordering the engrossment be
                            reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE inquired whether a motion to reconsider could be made after
                            three days? He referred the the latter part of the 36th rule.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. Then asked the unanimous consent cf the House to do this.</p>
                        <p>There being no objection, it was made the special order for Wednesday, at
                            ten o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTT moved the printing of two hundred copies of the bill. But after

                        <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN, the foregoing vote was reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Mr, BROWN preferred that the bill be perfected before printing. He moved
                            that the bill be referred to a special committee of five, and that the

                        <p>Mr THOMPSON. Mr. President, as Pysician of the Governor I earnestly
                            recommended his withdrawal from the cares of office as early as the
                            first of September. I have been acquainted with him for many years, and
                            have <pb n="57" xml:id="VAA8558-08-057"/>been his family physician for
                            upwards of three years. I have witnessed with painful anxiety the
                            gradual approach of his painful malady. The disease is a paralysis
                            perophlige, evidently produced by the fatigues to which the Governor has
                            been subjected, both mentally and physically, during the last five
                            years. Notwithstanding all I could say, I was unable to prevail upon him
                            to withdraw from the duties of his office at that time. He thought it
                            necessary to give his personal attention to the management of the public
                            business and interests of the State. But I never ceased to admonish him
                            of the danger of so doing. That my views on the subject may be known to
                            citizens and Legislators, together with the professional advice I then
                            gave, I beg leave to have a copy of the letter read to the Senate, which
                            I addressed to the Governor on the first of November.</p>
                        <p>The letter was read by the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN desired to offer an amendment. He was a little surprised that
                            his friend should introduce a bill that discriminates between the
                            inhabitants of this State. It says that every white male inhabitant may
                            sell, &amp;c. He moved to amend by striking the word
                            "white."</p>
                        <p>Mr, CHAMBERS proposed to amend by striking out wherever they occur these

                        <p>The SPEAKER announced the special order, to-wit : the consideration of Mr
                            Branham's bill [H. R. 186] declaring that the laws now in force are
                            sufficient to authorize the payment of the semi-annual interest on the
                            State Debt, &amp;c. The question being, shall the bill pass -</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK was not before aware that the Legislature of Indiana
                            possessed Judicial powers. The bill proposes to reveres the decision of
                            the Supreme Court. The only safety of persons and property is in
                            submission to our Judicial tribunals. The Court has decided that the
                            officers of State may not pay the interest without special legal
                            appropriation. Right or wrong that is the decision. We ought to keep the
                            powers of the Goveroment distinct and separate. It would be a very
                            dangerous precedent for the Legislature to infringe upon the province of
                            the judiciary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. If the entire object of the bill we w the gentleman
                            supposes, he also <pb n="60" xml:id="VAA8558-08-060"/> would be opposed
                            to it. He also would keep the departments of the Government separate and
                            distinct from each other. But the Supreme Court had aggressed in this
                            regard more than the Legislature. The bill requires the Treasurer of
                            State to deposit the interest on the public debt fifteen days before it
                            becomes due, and proposes to punish the State Agent if he refuses to pay
                            it. When the people replenish the Treasury with money for the purpose,
                            he was disposed to insist that this interest be paid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to recommit the bill with instructions to
                            "strike out all that part of the bill which refers to the power to
                            pay the interest without specific appropriation."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM only wished to say that in preparing this bill, he had no
                            reference whatever to the decision of the Supreme Court - he knew
                            nothing about it. The bill simply declares that the law now in force is
                            sufficient, and that no specific appropriation is necessary. The best
                            legal talent in the State, he believed, entertain this opinion of the
                            law now. But that there might be no mistake about it, he introduced this
                            bill. The object of the bill was to settle and secure this interest;
                            that notwithstanding the accident of the failure of an appropriation,
                            the money shall shall be paid. He left Constitutional questions to
                            others, but to give his opinion, he would say the bill does not
                            controvene the Constitution. If the reference were made with these
                            instructions, it would virtually kill the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's amendment was laid on the table, by yeas 65, nays
                            35.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE should vote against the bill because of is specific
                            contravention of the constitutional provision. The bill too much
                            expresses the power of an existing law, without distincly stating what
                            the law is.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH objected to the bill, because of its conflict with the
                            Supreme Court. It was arrogating a power which does not become us. He
                            submitted whether such a bill as this could pass the Senate. Some such a
                            law was needed, and was it not better to prepare some bill thai might
                            not be so palpably objectionable? He reasoned to show that the bill
                            could hardly be regarded as a declaratory law. Better get the bill in
                            just and acceptable shape. There would be just as much propriety in
                            declaring against the decisions of the Supreme Court by resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL had never concurred in this decision of the Supreme Court;
                            but because he deprecated conflict with the Supreme Court be had voted
                            against laying the amendment on the table. He thought the bill might be
                            made less objectionable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren demanded the previous question, and there was a
                            second, and the main question was ordered - affirmative 48 negative
                            41.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays on the passage of the bill resulted - yeas 56, nays 35
                            - as follows:</p>

                            of last session $5 for every 20 miles. It conforms to distances accepted

                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK was credited with ten miles too much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY dissented from the report, in this: that the distance by the

                        <p>Mr. WOODS. The committee had endeavored to do what is strictly right and

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend by adding 16 miles to the route of Mr.

                            the route of Mr. Glazebrook.</p>
                        <p>By unanimous consent, the allowances were again read through by the

                            upon which nowork has been done for ten years, coming up on the third

                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH could hardly vote for the bill, on account of the interests
                            in his section of the State in the Indiana and Grand Rapids Railroad,
                            running into the State of Michigan, and soon to be constructed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER understood that the provisions of the bill apply only to
                            branch roads.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK had two reasons against the passage of the bill. It involved
                            a judicial, not a legislative question, whether the Gosport and
                            Indianapolis branch had forfeited. Again, he understood that there were
                            pending negotiations to transfer this privilege of the New Albany Road
                            to a new Company, that proposes to make a road from Indianapolis to
                            Vincennes, by which the right of way and all the work done on the
                            branch, from Gosport to Mooresville, will become of great value to the
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN was willing for delay; would not do anything to prejudice
                            vested rights, but he defended the principles of the bill. He moved that
                            it lie on the table for the present.It was so ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVey's bill (<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_135">H. R. 135</ref>)
                            to amend sec. 651 of the General Practice Act,coming up on the third
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB (by consent) it was amended so as to substitute
                            "Indianapolis Daily <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>" for
                            "Indiana State <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>" in the final
                            clause.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE saw objection to the bill in this: that in the absence of
                            any contract between the parties to that effect, property may be sold
                            without appraisement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said it was of importance to Architects, Carpenters and
                            Builders. Under a machanies' lein the property may be sold without
                            appraisement. This was not a new principle in legislation. There were
                            other cases in which property was sold without appraisement. Such as in
                            the case of defaulting public officers, persons defaulting who have been
                            acting in a fiduciary capacity, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD doubted whether its provision would work well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren and Mr. McVEY: urged considerations in favor of
                            the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE could see no reason for making distinctions in favor of
                            Mechanics, to the neglect of Laborers and Farmers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH showed amongst other things, that the debtor could redeem his
                            property, so sold, within one year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER saw the benefit of attorneys in this bill more than the

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB did not think there was an attorney in this city that cared
                            one straw about this bill. Was it possible that the Legislature of
                            Indiana, which had never failed on occasion, to legislate for the
                            benefit of bankers, money lenders and money men, will refuse to protect
                            the poor mechanics?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Was there to be a distribution of the proceeds of sale under
                            this bill?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. There was nothing about that. It does not interfere with the
                            existing law. It places unwritten contracts on the same footing with
                            written contracts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. Might not the mechanic sue without a lien?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Certainly; and the lien gives no more advantage than a
                            mortgagee has.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed the final reading - yeas, 74; nays 13.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HUNT explained, that the object of the bill was to drop the
                            requisition upon the County Treasurers for monthly returns to the State
                            Treasurer.</p>

                        <p>On motion of Mr. CHURCH, the foregoing vote was reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH stated, that there was a difficulty attendant upon relieving
                            the County Treasurers from making these monthly reports. The State
                            Treasurer might be without valuable information at the critical
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HUNT was not tenacious for the bill, but stated some of the
                            disadvantages in his experience about making their monthly reports. The
                            Treasurer of State could still make his requisitions for money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. We ought not to break down so valuable a law for the sake of
                            relieving the County Treasurer from a little labor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. Are not the County Treasurers compelled to make semi-annual
                            reports beside the monthly reports for part of the year?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Certainly.</p>

                                        duties. I am advised by my physicians, and by my own
                                        knowledge of the condition of my health, that I cannot
                                        safely continue in the performance of the labor incident to
                                        the Executive office, and that rest, a change of climate and
                                        locality, is necessary to my recovery. The duties of the
                                        office during my absence will devolve upon Lieut. Governor
                                        Baker, and I need not say to you that they cannot be placed
                                        in safer hands. I have known him long and well, and can
                                        testify that in every department of life in which he has
                                        been placed, he has acquitted himself with distinguished

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK desired simply to say, that, on an occasion of this kind it
                            was due and becoming that whatever of the bitterness of party feeling
                            may have existed between us and Governor Morton, it should all be
                            repressed and forgotten, whilst we now sympathize with him in his
                            affliction; and he trusted these resolutions would be adopted without a
                            dissenting voice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB The House having heard of the indisposition of the Governor,
                            which induces his temporary withdrawal from the Executive office, we
                            should all part with him, though it may be but for a brief time, with
                            sadness; for his presence here has constantly reflected honor upon the
                            Scale; and whatever differences of opinion may have obtained with
                            reference to the policy of his acts, all will concede to him the purpose
                            and design to bring about in them the greatest good to the people of the
                            State, and that which redounds to her honor. He felt assured that, not
                            only amongst our constituents and fellow citizens who have trod the
                            paths of peace, but amongst those who have maintained the dignity and
                            honor of the nation on the fields of blood, this intelligence will come
                            with equal sadness. He was glad that a political opponent of the
                            Governor had introduced these resolutions. He rejoiced that the
                            Governor, in leaving us, will leave with the respect of those who
                            thought they had good ground to find fault with some of his official
                            acts; and, with the gentleman from Monroe, he trusted that there would
                            be no dissenting vote on the passage of the resolutions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. On occasions of this kind political differences ought never
                            to intervene. Governor Morton is the Executive of the State. He has, so
                            far as this body is concerned, treated us with uniform courtesy and
                            kindness. And it is nothing but simple duty to sympathize with him, more
                            especially when he needs it. I sincerely sympathize with the Governor,
                            and hope, as this resolution expresses it, that he may soon returan to
                            us with health restored. The resolution is couched in proper terms and
                            nothing but what is <pb n="63" xml:id="VAA8558-08-063"/> due to the
                            Governor at this time. I shall sincerely support it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT. As one who knows something of the feeling of respect that is
                            cherished for Gov. Morton amongst those who have been his supporters in
                            the army for four years and more, not only in the State of Indiana, but
                            in the State of Illinois, and in every State, I can testify that he has
                            their highest regards, and that he has the respect and love not only of
                            the wounded and disabled, but of those who have been so fortunate as to
                            return in safety to their homes; and that their profoundest wishes for
                            his welfare will follow him. He, too, was glad to see the
                            Governor's political friends and opposers concurring herein regrets
                            that he is to give up the Executive Chair for a time. He hoped the
                            resolutions would pass unanimously - for he could see in their passage a
                            feeling that did not attach to ordinary acts of this body.</p>
                        <p>The resolutions were adopted unanimously.</p>

                            and other attaches of the General Assembly, he saw in the proceedings of
                            the Senate already in this session, that they had passed resolutions
                            allowing their discharged clerks and employes five dollars a day. He
                            thought we should prevent this giving a greater compensation than the
                            law allows, by prohibiting the Auditor from drawing his warrant in favor
                            of cases where the legal compensation may have been exceeded by
                            resolution. He moved its reference to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and
                                Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr COFFROTH doubted whether a mere resolution in either House could
                            change a law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. It always has been done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Well, precedent goes a great way to show what a law is, but
                            still I doubt whether it can change or establish the law. But he did not
                            desire to press his motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH preferred to amend the bill now. He moved to allow the
                            elective officers of the House each five dollars a day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE would like to have the bill passed so that the displaced
                            officials of the Senate might be paid off to-day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH stated that the compensation of the elective officers of the
                            House was established by law - four dollars a day for the time actually
                            engaged in service.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. That settles the question. He withdrew his amendment, and
                            hoped the gentleman from Marion would withdraw his motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ABBETT. It was plain that if the bill was amended it cannot become a
                            law to-day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB declined to withdraw his motion, and if that should be voted
                            down he would offer an amendment. He deprecated tbe unseemly haste with
                            which successive Legislatures here were accustomed to hurry through
                            bills in the fore part of the session, appropriating $50,000, $75,000 or
                            a $100,000 to pay the expenses of the General Assembly, upon the plea of
                            necessity and poverty. Gentlemen need not tell him that our employes, or
                            even members themselves, are so strapped that they cannot remain here
                            over Sunday without starving.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. I am strapped, and the gentleman cannot dispute it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Then the gentleman ought to be strapped; but he doubted not
                            but that, upon representation of his case to-night, the Peru Railroad
                            superintendent would give him a free pass home. Mr. N. appealed again to
                            the recollection of gentlemen for the fact that this law of compensation
                            never has been recognized by either House of the General Assembly. He
                            cited cases, and said he did not want to be hounded by employes as we
                            were last session, coming to us, and begging us, for God's sake, to
                            increase their pay, when they are paid more than members themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN was a little like the gentleman from Delaware, but with this
                            advantage: he had a credit circumscribed by no narrow limits. He hoped
                            the gentleman from Marion would not try to scare the House by telling us
                            he will submit amendments; because the House can dispose of his
                            amendments as well as his motion. He was disposed to give to every bill
                            all due consideration; but here is a bill coming from the Senate - a
                            body of men of equal experience, ability, knowledge and judgment, with
                            ourselves - it has been carefully considered - it has been considered by
                            their Committee, and he did not think the gentleman from Marion or any
                            other gentleman would be likely to make it any better. The gentleman had
                            talked about the law being violated. He did not care how strong you make
                            the bill, it will still be violated if the House desires it - the
                            courteous House will still give their <pb n="67" xml:id="VAA8558-08-067"/> officers an increased per diem if they please. Until you make a
                            positive law declaring that the House shall not pass these corteoua
                            resolutions, or until gentlemen get better sense, they will continue to
                            pass them. But he considered that these gentlemen who had been laboring
                            for the State of Indiana should have their pay, so that they may settle
                            their board bills, and not be thrown out in the cold.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The gentleman, his friend from Marion, forgets one thing -
                            he is here at home, has no board bill to pay - and there is this
                            difference between himself and others here who have left their homes and
                            made their arrangements for family expenses for these forty days,
                            requiring a considerable outlay of money at once. Mr. B referred also to
                            the displaced officials of the Senate, of whom he was advised there was
                            quite a number, without the means of getting home. He did not think they
                            ought to be kept here any longer. Then he could estop the gentleman from
                            Marion's complaint about resoluuons over-riding law, by reference
                            to a report which he made in the close of the last session as Chairman
                            of the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>. At the close of
                            the last session, when a certain appropriation bill failed, he (Mr.B )
                            introduced a resolution inquiring of the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName> whether it was not competent for the House to
                            pay money by resolution which had been appropriated in that bill. And
                            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> reported that it was; and so
                            we paid a large portion of the appropriation bill in that way. And if
                            the Chairman on <orgName>Ways and Means</orgName> is not very much
                            mistaken, and I am not at fault in my estimates, the gentleman from
                            Marion will still have another opportunity to insert his proviso in
                            another appropriation bill before this session closes; for I think this
                            sum of $50,000 will be wholly insufficent and another appropriation will
                            have to be made to pay the expenses of this session of the
                            Legislature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question, on Mr. Coffroth's motion
                            to suspend the constitutional restriction.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said, the amendment will have precedence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB now submitted his proviso, to come in at the end of the
                            second section, to this effect: "That it shall not be lawful for
                            the Auditor of State to draw his warrant in favor of any employee of the
                            General Assembly for the payment of any <hi rend="i">per diem</hi>
                            authorized by resolution of either House,not provided for by law,"
                            &amp;c. And he proposed further to amend, by adding a clause allowing to
                            the principal clerks and doorkeepers each five dollars a day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH submitted whether the amendment to fix the pay of officers
                            was germain to the proposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. That thing has been done over and over again, and is done by
                            this very bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH accorded the principle of the amendment, and pledged himself
                            to support it, if the gentleman would make it a separate bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to lay the amendments on the table.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays being demanded, ordered and taken thereon, resulted -

                                    <p>You have already been informed by His Excellency, the
                                        Governor, of his inability for the present to discharge the
                                        duties of his office. In assuming the duties devolved upon
                                        me by the Constitution, I cannot refrain from expressing my
                                        profound regret that the State should be even temporarily
                                        deprived of the services of an officer in whose wisdom and
                                        patriotism the people have such implicit confidence, nor
                                        from giving utterance to the hope for his speedy restoration
                                        to health and the performance of the duties to which he was
                                        called by the voice of his fellow-citizens. Allow me here to
                                        express my ardent desire to co-operate with the General
                                        Assembly in all measures intended to promote the honor and
                                        prosperity of the State and the welfare of its people.</p>
                                    <p>I beg leave herewith respectfully to submit the report of Dr.
                                        William Haimaman, President of the Indiana Sanitary
                                        Commission, setting forth a statement of the receipts and
                                        expenditures of the Commission from the 10th day of
                                        December, 1864, to November 10th, 1865, and also showing the
                                        aggregate receipts and disbursements since its
                                        establishment. The Commission was organized in February,
                                        1862. and it will be seen from the report of the President
                                        now submitted that its Cash receipts since that time amount
                                        to the sum of two hundred and six thousand six hundred and
                                        five dollars and twenty-six cents, while the contributions
                                        in stores and supplies, at their estimated cash value,
                                        amount to the further sum of three hundred and fifty-nine
                                        thousand dollars and three cents, making a grand total of
                                        $565,105 29 of voluntary contributions by the people of
                                        Indiana, to administer to the qomfort and supply the wants
                                        of our soldiers. The cash expenditures of the Commission
                                        during the same period, amount to the sum of $206,105 26,
                                        leaving a balance of cash in the treasury of the Commission,
                                        at this time, of $500, all the stores and supplies
                                        contributed having been applied as contemplated by the
                                        contributors. This record is highly creditable to the
                                        humanity, patriotism and justice of the people of this
                                        State. It was the desire of Governor Morton to communicate
                                        to the General Assembly his high appreciation of the
                                        services of the gentlemen who have contributed so much of
                                        their time, energy and talents to the collection, management
                                        and distribution of these moneys and supplies, and I deeply
                                        regret that circumstances beyond his control prevented him
                                        from properly acknowledging these services in his official
                                        capacity.</p>
                                    <p>I desire to say in this connection, that Dr. Hannaman, the
                                        able and faithful President of the Commission, is entitled
                                        to the gratitude and thanks of the people of the State, for
                                        the industry, prudence and fidelity with which he has
                                        presided over the operations of the Commission since its
                                        organization. Alfred Harrison, Esq, the patriotic Treasurer
                                        of the Commission, is no less entitled to be held in
                                        grateful remembrance, for the ability and fidelity with
                                        which he has managed the funds of the Commission. The zeal
                                        intelligence and industry of Chaplain John H. Lozier and
                                        Captain A. Atkinson in commending the cause of our brave
                                        soldiers to the sympathies of the people, and collecting
                                        contributions to the Sanitary work, are known throughout the
                                        State, and appreciated wherever known. To enumerate all
                                        those who have devoted their energies to the furtherance of
                                        this great work of beneficent justice, would exceed the
                                        limits prescribed for this communication; but their labors
                                        will long be remembered by the people, and especially by the
                                        soldiers and their friends.</p>
                                    <p>I also herewith submit the report of Dr. Wm. Hannaman,
                                        General Military Agent of the State, showing the condition
                                        and operations of all the Indiana Military Agencies
                                        established by the Governor from December, 1864 to the
                                        present time. I especially commend this report to the
                                        careful consideration of the General Assembly. The good
                                        performed, and the suffering prevented or alleviated through
                                        the instrumentality of these agencies, cannot be too highly
                                        appreciated. I respectfully recommend that provision be made
                                        for the continuance of the Agency at Washington City, and
                                        for placing it on a permanent basis. The wants of our
                                        discharged soldiers and the families of such as have given
                                        their lives to their county will probably require such a
                                        central agency for several years, A necessity, also, in my
                                        judgment, exists for the continuance, for the present, of an
                                        agency at Indianapolis. The small sum that it will cost the
                                        people of the State to continue these two agencies will be a
                                        trifle in comparison to the large amounts which will be
                                        saved to the surviving soldiers of this State, and to the
                                        families of those who have died in the service, in the
                                        preparation and presentation of their claims against the
                                        Government. The few remaining agencies, as will be seen by
                                        the report above referred to. will soon be closed.</p>
                                    <p>I also herewith transmit to the General Assembly the memorial
                                        of the Board of Trustees of the Indiana Agricultural
                                        College, praying for the passage of a joint resolution
                                        instructing <pb n="69" xml:id="VAA8558-08-069"/> our
                                        Senators and requesting our Representatives in Congress to
                                        use their influence to procure such a modification of the
                                        act of Congress as will enable States in which there are no
                                        public lands subject to entry, instead of selling their land
                                        scrip, to enter lands therewith in any other States in which
                                        there may be Government lands subject to entry. Under
                                        existing legislation, if there is no public land subject to
                                        entry in the State to which the scrip is issued, lands
                                        cannot be entered with the, scrip in any other State, but
                                        the State to which the issue is made will be compelled to
                                        sell the scrip in order to establish and endow the
                                        College.</p>
                                    <p>The object should be to realize from the munificent
                                        Congressional Donation for the establishment and endowment
                                        of Agricnltural Colleges in the several States the largest
                                        possible amount. If the scrip is forced upon the market by
                                        all those States, who, like Indiana, have no lands, or
                                        comparatively none, within their limits subject to entry,
                                        the result will be the depreciation of the scrip, and, to
                                        that extent, the defeat of the object of the grant. With a
                                        proviso in the proposed amendatory act requiring any State
                                        entering lands with scrip, in another State, to sell the
                                        same within a limited time, say five or six years from the
                                        date of entry, it is believed that no good reason exists why
                                        the modification prayed for should not be granted.</p>
                                    <p>I, therefore, respectfully recommend the passage of a joint
                                        resolution instructing our Senators and requesting our
                                        Representatives to use their influence to procure the
                                        passage, of an amendatory act, such as is prayed for in the
                                        memorial, with a proviso requiring the sale of the land
                                        within some reasonable time, as before suggested. The
                                        Commissioner of the General Land Office had called the
                                        attention of the Board of Trustees of the Indiana
                                        Agricultural College to the fact that, while the act passed
                                        at your last session, and approved March 6, 1865, accepting
                                        the Congressional grant, contains a provision in the fifth
                                        section thereof authorizing the Treasurer of the Board of
                                        Trustees of the Indiana Agricultural College, under the
                                        direction of the Board, to sell the land scrip which might
                                        be received under the Congressional grant; no authority is
                                        conferred to transfer or assign the scrip which may be so
                                        sold. The General Assembly, in passing the act above alluded
                                        to, doubtless considered the power to <hi rend="i">transfer</hi> as incident to the power to <hi rend="i">sell</hi>, but to obviate all doubt on that subject, I
                                        respectfully recommend that the fifth section of the act
                                        accepting the grant be so amended as to expressly empower
                                        the assignment of the scrip when sold. To that end, I
                                        herewith respectfully submit for your consideration an
                                        amendatory bill, prepared under the supervision of the Board
                                        of Trustees of the Indiana Agricultural College. I am
                                        Informed that the market is now glutted with land scrip
                                        issued to other States, and that the result is that it is
                                        selling as low as fifty cents per acre. At these rates the
                                        scrip to which Indiana is entitled under the grant,
                                        representing, as it will, 390,000 acres of land, would be
                                        entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the object in
                                        view. Under these circumstances, if a modification of the
                                        act of Congress so as to permit the entry of land, as before
                                        suggested, can hot be procured, sound policy manifestly
                                        requires that the scrip which Indiana may receive should
                                        not, for the present, be put in,market I therefore recommend
                                        that the act of last session be further amended so as to
                                        prohibit the sale of any of the scrip for a limited time, to
                                        be named in the act, or that a price be designated below
                                        which it shall not be sold.</p>
                                    <p>I beg leave, also, to call the attention of the General
                                        Assembly to the fact that, by the fifth section of the Act
                                        of Congress approved July 2,1862, the grant in aid of
                                        Agricultural Colleges is made subject to the condition that
                                        any State which shall take and claim the benefit of the
                                        provisions of that act <hi rend="i">shall</hi> provide
                                        within five years, at least, not less than, one college, as
                                        descri bed in the fourth section of the act, or the grant to
                                        such State shall cease, and said State shall be bound to pay
                                        the United States the amount received of any lands
                                        previously sold. As less than two of the five years remain
                                        within which a college must be provided to prevent a
                                        forfeiture; I respectfully suggest the propriety of an
                                        application to Congress for an extension of the time limited
                                        for the establishment of such college.</p>

                                    <p>I herewith respectfully transmit to the General Assembly the
                                        report of the Board of control of the Northern Indiana State
                                        Prison, with the accompanying reports of the Superintendent
                                        of Construction and the Warden of the prision. From the
                                        report of the Board of Control, it appears that a contract
                                        for the completion of the prison has been made, at a price
                                        which, according to the accompanying estimates of the work
                                        to be done, will require $179, 747 59; which sum is in
                                        excess of existing appropriations on account of
                                        construction, to the amount of $97,747 49. And for this last
                                        named amount an appropriation is asked by the Board. A
                                        further appropriation is solicited by the Board of $30,000
                                        for the erection of the kitchen, dining-room and hospital
                                        buildings of the Prison, and the still further sum of $8,133
                                        71; to discharge the debt of that amount accrued prior to
                                        the 15th day of Nov., 1865, on account of current expenses,
                                        making the aggregate amount asked to be,appropriated
                                        $135,921 20.</p>
                                    <p>Whilst I have great confidence in the integrity and capacity
                                        of the Board of Control, I am not sufficiently informed as
                                        to the past history and present necessities of this Prison
                                        to justify me in making any specific recommendation on the
                                        subjects embraced in the report. I therefore commend the
                                        consideration of the report to the General Assembly, feeling
                                        assured that such measures will be enacted, and such
                                        appropriations made as the condition of our finances will
                                        justify and the public welfare may require.</p>
                                    <p>I also herewith respectfully transmit a copy of a
                                        communication from Andrew Wallace, Esq, President of the
                                        Board of Trustees of the Benevolent Institutions,
                                        accompanied by a copy of the report made to him by the
                                        Superintendent of the Indiana Institute for the Education of
                                        the Blind. No appropriation is asked for the Hospital, but
                                        it will be seen by the report of the Superintendent of the
                                        institute for the Blind that the existing appropriations for
                                        the Institute for the Education of the Blind are largely
                                        insufficient to meet current expenses, and to defray the
                                        cost of repairs which would seem to be absolutely necessary
                                        to prevent a suspension of the operations of this
                                        institution, and I therefore earnestly recommend that, after
                                        investigating its condition and ascertaining its
                                        necessities, through the appropriate committees, such
                                        appropriations be made as will enable the Institute to
                                        continue the mission of mercy for which it was wisely
                                        established.</p>

                            report the actual distances by the usually travelled route.</p>

                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, from the Special Committee thereon, returned his bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_199">No 199</ref>, amending An Act to
                            incorporate the Indianapolis Insurance Company, recommending
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr CORBIN. We should not be too fast in granting extended privileges to
                            corporations, we should look well to it that they do not become
                            monopolies to such an extent as to control the rights of citizens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that he was personally friendly to the parties
                            interested in the bill, but he was opposed, as a general rule, to
                            amending special charters. He thought it far wiser, if necessary, to
                            amend and perfect the general laws and encourage companies existing
                            under special acts to reorganize under the general laws. He saw nothing
                            objectionable in the bill except the act being special. He moved the
                            reference of the bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                                Corporations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON regretted the delay that would ensue if the motion
                            prevailed, but would offer no objection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN hoped the motion to recommit would prevail. There seems to be
                            a disposition on the part of members to benefit their friends, without
                            regard to the general laws of the State and the good of the people at
                            large. All corporations should have the same benefits; all men should be
                            placed upon an equal footing, who de sire to invest in this or any other
                            enterprise. Senators should go slow in giving powers, and granting
                            rights to corporations.</p>
                        <p>Mr COBB being friendly to the bill was willing to have it recommitted as
                            proposed, and hoped the Committee would report at an early day.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was agreed to.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT hoped the Senate would not adopt the resolution in any shape.
                            Everybody knows United States bonds are not taxed, nor can they be taxed
                            by the State, and the resolution is presuming that the balance of us are
                            more ignorant than we are willing to admit. Its reference ta a committee
                            would amount to nothing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, with due deference to the opinion of the Senator from Union,
                            [Mr. Bennett,] thought it a very grave question whether the State of
                            Indiana can tax United States bonds or stocks. If the Senator were to
                            read the opinion of Judge Denio, of New York, lately published, his mind
                            would not be so clear. While we may not tax the principal of the bonds
                            themselves, there is no question but that we can tax the income upon
                            these bonds. I would reach these bond-holders in every possible shape
                            without violating the true spirit of the Constitution of the United
                            States and rules of law. I am not in <pb n="71" xml:id="VAA8558-08-071"/> favor of legislating for capital against labor, Let us have taxation
                            distributed equally among all classes - especially would I favor the
                            laboring classes of community. I would invade the contract itself for
                            the purpose of relieving the people from the burdens of taxation which
                            were forced upon Congress by the capitalists themselves. The time will
                            come when the people will speak out, and then bondholders will have to
                            do one of two things, or repudiation will follow. I am no repudiator and
                            am opposed to it, but I would, for the purpose of preventing that, and
                            protecting these bondholders in future, throw enough of the burden upon
                            them to make it equal, and thereby prevent this uprising of tbe people
                            on account of the burdens of taxation. These capitalists ask the
                            Government to protect their property, and they ought to bear an equal
                            share of the burdens in order to keep up the Government. I would not
                            violate a clear provision of law adopted in the spirit of the
                            fundamental law of the land, but I would go as far as the farthest, if I
                            could see my way clear, in seeing these securities taxed. These men have
                            no right to complain. When they saw tbe country in trouble, they
                            demanded certain rights - to secure them in loaning their money. It was
                            not patriotism in them, and now they should be taxed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. A properly drawn resolution of this kind I might be willing to
                            see go to the <orgName>Judiciary</orgName> or the <orgName>Finance
                                Committee</orgName>, whatever my private opinions might be on the
                            subject, but I am not willing to put myself upon the record in favor of
                            any such foolish thing. I am not in favor of repudiation, in one thing
                            or another, and whenever we tax Government bonds we go that far toward
                            repudiation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. We have a statute telling us what is taxable and what is
                            not. It is a very plain case to me that all Government bonds are
                            taxable, and I would so act until some decision of our courts should be
                            made to the contrary. He read from the statute governing the assessment
                            and collection of taxes, in Gavin &amp; Hord, vol. 1, page 73, sec.
                            23d.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. Cannot that provision be set aside by a decision of the
                            Supreme Court of the United States?</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Until it is made for Indiana our officers should support
                            this law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON. Against the General Government?</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. Against the General Government or anybody else.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. This is a question of abstract law, and the Supreme Court of
                            the United States, the highest judicial authority in this Government,
                            has already decided that Government bonds are not taxable. That is in
                            conflict with this law of the State of Indiana.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB (interrupting,) when was that decision made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. Not more than 3 or 4 months ago, and if my memory serves me
                            the decision made by Judge Denio - to which the Senator referred -
                            reviews the whole matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER, Do you recognize the doctrine that the decision of the
                            Supreme Court is binding upon all the citizens of this Government?</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. I do, sir.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. Upon what ground, then, do you justify the organization of
                            the party opposed to the Dred Scott decision?</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. It is not necessary for me to justify it; the people have
                            justified it to the gentleman's satisfaction long since. It is very
                            proper that the Senators from these dark districts should attempt to
                            organize a new party upon that basis, and when they get a majority of
                            the people with them they can have it all their own way. I was opposed
                            to the Dred Scott decision, but I have always obeyed it, as gentlemen
                            will have to do in this instance. But I do not propose to discuss the
                            main question now. As this resolution is not so much a financial as a
                            law question, it should go to the <orgName>Judiciary
                            Committee</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. These bonds are not taxable, and if we had the power and
                            were to tax them it would be one step toward repudiation. Gentlemen may
                            talk about some men having the burdens of taxation to pay, while some
                            men have not; but I remember that when the Senators' friends had
                            the right to buy them if they chose, they didn't want them; they
                            said the war was a failure, and that these bonds were utterly worthless.
                            But there was a class of men in this country who bad a higher faith, men
                            who had hopes in the army and navy, men who had some love of country
                            about them, who had a hope that this country would come out
                            successfully, and they put their capital in these bonds. They
                            didn't put it in old stocking-legs, like the Senators'
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB (interrupting.) As far as I am concerned, I do not propose, in
                            this Senate, on a question of purely financial character to lug in
                            politics, and I will give the Senator to understand that his imputations
                            with regard to love of country do not come with good grace from him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. I do not make them toward the Senator personally, but to the
                            party with which he acts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, But this is a financial question - one in which everybody is
                            interested. It is not a party question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. It may not be a party question, but I notice the
                            Senator's friends throughout the State, and every place, are trying
                            to make some capital of it. And that is the object of introducing this
                            resolution here. I know the Senator is too good a lawyer to defend this
                            resolution upon any other ground. And, as far as I am concerned, I
                            accept the issue. I am for standing up to that contract, for never was
                            there a more honorable and patriotic contract, than this one made with
                            those men who came in at the time of the country's greatest trial
                            and said, "Here is my money - I will take your notes; I will take
                            your bonds; I don't care how many conventions declare the war a
                            failure."</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB (interposing). I will ask the Senator whether the Republican
                            Convention of New York did not take the same position that the Democrats
                            have in their Conventions?</p>
                        <pb n="72" xml:id="VAA8558-08-072"/>
                        <p>MR. BENNETT. I do not remember. If the Republican party ever are in favor
                            of repudiating one dollar of the national debt, then I am no longer a
                            Republican after that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. I would ask the Senator from Lawrence if the Republican
                            Convention in New York did not propose to tax bonds issued
                            hereafter?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. That is not my recollection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. That is my recollection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MASON moved to amend the resolution so as to request the
                                <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>, should they think the
                            bonds are taxable, to report a bill to tax the same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE. I accept the amendment to refer the resolution to the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. I regard this as purely a judicial question, and I am sorry
                            the Senator from Union [Mr. Bennett] attempts to make it a political
                            one. The question is to be decided by the Supreme Court of the United
                            States, whether Congress has the power to pass such a law. With due
                            respect to my Republican friends, I say that the Congress of the United
                            States have no constitutional power to pass such a law. Gentlemen have
                            referred to several decisions of the Supreme Court upon this question,
                            but permit me to say that the Supreme Court of the United States have
                            never passed upon this question. It passed upon the question under the
                            old United States Bank - when the Government did all her business
                            through the branches of that bank - when the city of Charleston
                            attempted to tax the bonds held by the people, and Chief Justice
                            Marshall decided that a State had no right to tax those bonds. But this
                            is a different question entirely. Here the bonds issued by the United
                            States are purchased by individuals; and I hold that whenever these
                            bonds are purchased by individuals the United States looses all interst
                            and control over these bonds. They become as absolutely the property of
                            the individual who buys them, as a horse that is purchased from the
                            Government; and I never could see the reason why the State of Indiana
                            could not reap revenue from any property a person may have. Can any
                            gentleman produce to me a satisfactory reason why a banker who does
                            business with a hundred thousand dollars, should pay no tax for the
                            purpose of keeping up the State Government, while a man who invests the
                            same amount of money in agricultural pursuits, and thereby opens up an
                            increase of the wealth of the State, has to nay all the taxes and the
                            banker none? There is certainly great injustice about this thing. I have
                            examined this question with considerable care If I were a bond-holder
                            and owned $100,000 worth of bonds, as a matter of right and justice to
                            myself, and looking to my interest for the payment of these bonds when
                            they become due, I would vote to tax them. You may call this repudiation
                            if you will, but I say unless the whole property of the country is
                            taxed, we will never be able to pay the indebtedness of the Government.
                            If you allow, as in this case, one-third of the wealth of the country to
                            remain un-taxed, I give it as a sound proposition, where will you get
                            the money to pay these bonds when they become due? Gentlemen say there
                            is a contract entered into by the general Government with these men who
                            came from everywhere for the purpose of buying these bonds, not for the
                            purpose of investment, but for the purpose of helping the general
                            Government out of a drag. I have no doubt in many instances that was
                            true, but I do not think it was so in a majority of instances. No doubt
                            these bonds will run into the hands of the capitalists of the country;
                            and now let me ask if patriotism led them to invest their money in these
                            bonds, why will not that same patriotism return to them when they shall
                            see financial ruin before the country, and lead them to say, for the
                            purpose of helping the General Government out of this trouble, "tax
                            my property all you tax anybody else?"</p>
                        <p>I am opposed to this for another reason. I hold that in a Government like
                            ours, based upon the people - kept up by the help of the people - it is
                            the duty of the people to look to this question, and it is their duty to
                            speak in reference to it without regard to party. I am not going to
                            allow this question to take a party chute with me. It is a question,
                            under the act of March the 3d, whether every dollar issued in the shape
                            of greenbacks - whether a man can not keep even these in his pocket and
                            refuse to pay taxes upon them. Then let this question go to the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, and let them say to the
                            Senate, whether, in their judgment, the Constitution of the United
                            States was violated by the passage of that law. With this view of the
                            matter, if in order, I move to strike out so much of this resolution as
                            questions whether or not Government bonds are taxed by law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. As a test vote, I move to lay the resolution and amendments

                        <p>Mr. COBB said he did not like to vote for the resolution in the shape it

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN said the way this resolution now reads he was not willing to
                            put himself upon the record in favor of it. I am not willing that the
                            people shall read to-morrow in the newspapers that I voted for a
                            committee to inquire whether United States bonds are taxed in the State
                            of Indiana. I would be certain that my constituents would send for me.

                        <p>Mr. WILES said he thought it only respectful to the Senator that a
                            resolution of inquiry upon this somewhat important question should go to
                            a committee, and he was intending to vote for it; but the wording of the
                            resolution as it now stands compelled him to vote "no."</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK said he thought the resolution was so amended as to ask
                            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> to inquire whether these
                            bonds are taxable, but upon hearing it read was not willing to vots for
                            so absurd a resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON had the same understanding, and for the same reason changed
                            his vote from "aye" to "nay."</p>

                        <p>Mr. N. said the law now requires the docketing of cases in the order in

                            from the several Circuits may be docketed together, that lawyers may

                        <p>Mr. GREGG introduced a joint resolution [H.R. No. 18] in relation to the
                            taxation of United States bonds and other public securities.</p>
                        <p>Also, a joint resolution [H. R 19] in relation to the taxation of United
                            States bonds for county, township and city purposes, as other
                            investments of money are taxed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved tha they be referred to the <orgName>Committee on the
                                Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE thought this a motion for throwing this resolution into the
                            hands of a Committee where they will sleep till the end of the session.
                            He considered that these bonds should be taxed as other property, and he
                            desired the House to act upon this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN concurred with the gentleman from Delaware. He wanted these
                            resolutions adopted and pent to our Senators and Representatives at
                            Washington. And as his friend Carr [near him] was now on his way there,
                            it could not be entrusted to safer hands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB thought all those propositions should go to the same
                            Committee, and as one member of the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName>, he promised action and report on the matter.
                            They were all plain legal questions involved in these resolutions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER submitted that resolutions of that class should go to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>, without debate.
                            The resolution authorizing the rule is in page 246 of the journal of the
                            House of last session.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair is of opinion that joint resolutions do not come
                            within the spirit and letter of this resolution. There was a difference
                            between a simple resolution of the House and a joint resolution, the
                            latter assimilating itself to a bill. It was the design of the rule to
                            refer mere political matters without debate.</p>
                        <p>[A message was now received by Acting Governor Baker, announcing that he
                            has authorized Charles P. Jacobs, Esq., to make executive communications
                            to the General Assembly. Also, a message in writing which was read by Mr
                            Jacobs, for which see Senate proceedings.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB controverted the decision of the Chair that Mr. Gregg's
                            joint resolution did not come under the force of the resolution
                            directing such matter to go to the <orgName>Commitiee on Federal
                                Relations</orgName> He showed that the concurrent resolutions of Mr.
                            Groves and two others having reference to national affiirs, already
                            introduced since this session convened, were referred without debates to
                            the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>; and these had
                            reference to national affairs as distinctly as those.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN referred to the reason for this rule of the last session. There
                            was a dispositon amongst members to introduce resolutions relative to
                            the condition of the country, and we found that the time we owed to the
                            people was being wasted in useless debate in regard to the Sons of
                            Liberty, loyalty, treason, and kindred topics, and the resolution for
                            this rule was introduced simply to cut off debate on such questions. But
                            this joint resolution does not touch federal or national affiirs. It was
                            simply a matter of finance. But here, the other day, was a resolution
                            asking that Jeff. Davis be hung. That was a resolution just such as was
                            intended to be repressed by the resolution of the last session. This
                            joint resolution, being of another character, it could not be regarded
                            as coming under the rule requiring the reference to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Buskirk in the chair) referred to the course of
                            proceeding in the consideration of a joint resolution under the rules of
                            the House. The Supreme Court regarded a joint resolution in some
                            respects as a bill. But there was certainly a very distinct difference
                            between a "joint resolution" and a mere resolution of the
                            House. The chair admitted that these joint resolutions did unquetionably
                            refer to National affairs; and thereupon gave the decision, that it go
                            to the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>; - not because
                            it was held to be a correct ruling, but because such had been the ruling
                            by the Speaker heretofore.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HENRIOKS. Daring the last session a bill was introduced by the
                            gentleman from Randolph (Mr. Reese,) on the subject of fixing the rates
                            of freights upon railroads, which was referred to a Special Committee of
                            which Mr. H. was a member. He reported it back with amendments, - the
                            Journal showing that the bill was reported back, but the amendments were
                            not to be found. The object of that bill was to fix the rate of freight.
                            He desired now to introduce a bill merely fixing the rate of fare for
                            passengers; and in the consideration of this bill we can test the
                            judgment of of the House as to whether we have the right or the power to
                            fix these rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. H. then introduced a bill [H. R. 232] for an act limiting the amount
                            of fare for passengers on railroads, and providing penalty for vio
                            lation of this act. [It shall riot be lawful for railroads to charge or
                            receive more than three cents a mile for pessengers for any distance of

                                    <p>WHEREAS, The Journal Company having announced to this House
                                        that they will hereafter abridge their reports of the
                                        proceedings of this House;</p>
                                    <p>AND, WHEHEAS, The publication of full reports of the
                                        proceedings of this House was a condition of the contract
                                        with said Journal Company for three copies of their paper to
                                        each member; therefore - </p>
                                    <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That the doorkeeper be directed
                                        to rescind the said contract with the Journal Company, and
                                        make the same contract with the Gazette Company, provided
                                        that the latter Company agree to print the Brevier Reports
                                        in full.</p>

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said there was no such condition in the Journal
                            Company's contract with the doorkeeper. He moved to amend by adding
                            a direction to rescind the contract with the Daily <hi rend="i">Telegraph</hi> and Daily <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>, it they do not
                            publish the Brevier Reports.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon a debate ensued, in which Messrs. KILGORE,
                            CHAMBERS,NEWCOMB,GRIFFITH and others took part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to make the resolution the special order for to-morrow
                            morning, 11 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COX moved to lay the resolution and amendment on the table</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.</p>
                        <p>The House refused to lay the subject on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved to strike out so much of the resolution as assumes that
                            the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> Company have violated their contract with
                            the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS accepted this amendment as a matter of courtesy toward the
                                <hi rend="i">Journal Company</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair will hold that the amendment disposes of the
                            preamble; and that the amendment of the gentleman from Marion (Mr.
                            Newcomb) is not in order, because there remains nothing in the
                            proposition to which it can be applied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK thought the House, by this time, has discovered that we are
                            acting prematurely; for we do not know but that the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> reports will yet be satisfactory. He moved to lay the
                            whole subject on the table.</p>
                        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

                        <p>On motion of Mr. NILES, the House amendments to the bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_196">S. No. 196</ref> (printed in full in
                            these Reports of the 14th inst.) were taken up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT understood that this bill was gotten up and hurried through
                            here to interfere with a case now pending before the Supreme Judges, and
                            he was opposed to any such kind of legislation. He was in favor of the
                            bill, but opposed to the emergency clause amendment of the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES, as far as the history of the bill is concerned, was not
                            informed, except that the Judges are solicitous that it should pass. He
                            was satisfied it was not instigated by any party concerned in any case
                            before the Supreme Judges.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. The bill will be of little or no avail, so far as the present
                            session of the Supreme Court is concerned, unless the emergency clause
                            is attached to it. There is a case now before the Supreme Court in which
                            some 80 witnesses are summoned who are unable to pay their expenses, and
                            it is a burden grevious to be borne - one which should not be allowed by
                            the Legislature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN was somewhat acquainted with the case referred to. Judge
                            Elliott had not yet entered upon the trial; the State of Indiana is not
                            ready and will not be ready; so the emergency clause will do no harm in
                            this case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG would not do injustice to a party litigant, but it does seem
                            from the light <pb n="77" xml:id="VAA8558-08-077"/>thrown upon the
                            question that the bill certainly ought to pass. The case referred to
                            would occupy the time of the Supreme Court too long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER (interposing.) I am informed by one of the leading parties to
                            the suit that they will not have many witnesses.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG. But the business of that Court has been much behindhand, and
                            it would be doing gross injustice to parties all over the State to claim
                            the attention and the time of the Supreme Court in trying this case. He
                            hoped the bill would pass as it came from the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON was satisfied that this bill had been introduced for the
                            purpose of depriving the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over this case.
                            He happened to know that the defendant was now in jail, having already
                            applied to the Common Pleas Judge of that district, who very coolly
                            answered that he had no jurisdiction in the case. The defendant did not
                            see fit to take his case before the Judge at home for some cause -
                            probably for fear the Judge was prejudiced - and he then had no remedy
                            but to come to the Supreme Court. Without casting any reflection upon
                            any gentleman here, Mr. A. thought this bill was introduced for the
                            purpose of sending this party back and compelling him to lay in jail
                            until the next term of that District Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES (interposing) was confident that the bill was drawn up by one
                            of the Judges of the Supreme Court, and introduced at their instance and
                            request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON. That may be true - the Supreme Court may be glad to get rid
                            of this labor. But I am opposed to the emergency clause; and if it be
                            true that the State will not be ready, and the case can not be tried, it
                            does away with the necessity for the emergency clause, because this is
                            the only case of any importance requiring time. And I feel authorized to
                            say that gentlemen are misinformed in regard to the number of witnesses
                            - there will only be a few witnesses examined, and I cannot conceive
                            that it will take up more than one or two days. But I do not believe
                            that the time of the Judges is so valuable that the liberty of a citizen
                            shall be put in jeopardy for the want of a trial. The witnesses are here
                            already and the case can be tried at once. If this bill is passed they
                            will have to go home and be dragged off to some other court, which will
                            cost them more time and money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB had a resolution drawn up which he intended to offer, when we
                            came co that or der of business, requesting the House of Representatives
                            to return this bill in order that the Senate might make some amendments
                            to it. Upon reflection he was satisfied the Senate passed that bill too
                            hasty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES (interposing) was confident the original bill was in the
                            handwriting of Judge Frazier, and that it contained an emergency
                            clause.</p>
                        <p>Mr COBB should certainly oppose the passage of the bill with an emergency
                            clause for the reasons urged by the Senator from Jefferson [Mr.
                            Allison]. He did not believe it a duty to relieve the Judges to the
                            injury of litigating parties. We had better leave the burden upon the
                            Supreme Court until the case now pending before them shall be disposed
                            of.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN believed it wrong to abridge the right of <hi rend="i">habeas
                                corpus.</hi> The very reason given for the passage of the bill, with
                            the emergency clause, - that parties are here with witnesses and
                            attorneys - is one of the strongest reasons against passing it at all.
                            These parties come up here because they believe they could not have a
                            fair hearing before other courts having concurrent jurisdiction with the
                            Supreme Court. There may be great inconvenience felt by the Judges in
                            being compelled to sit upon such cases, but how much greater
                            inconvenience is felt by that individual who is compelled to lay in jail
                            because there are no courts open to hear his case. Parties never apply
                            to Judges of the Supreme Court for a writ if they can get it done
                            properly, in their judgment, at home. And why? For the simplest reason
                            in the world: It will cost them one hundred times more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. I am informed that this case is continued until to-morrow, the
                            probability is there will be an order issued to take depositions, and
                            that the Judge is willing to hear the case. I would make this
                            proposition to Senators: that we postpone the further consideration of
                            the amendments of the House of Representatives until 2 o'clock
                            Tuesday, and make it the special order for that hour.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to by common consent.</p>

                                        Soldiers' National Cemetery, at Gettysburg,
                                        Pennsylvania, appointed as such by the Governor of the
                                        State, together with the printed documents referred to in
                                        the report, and marked A. B. C. and D., respectively, and
                                        commend the same to your careful consideration. I also
                                        transmit herewith a printed pamphlet entitled
                                        "Soldiers' National Cemetery, at Gettysburg,
                                        Pennsylvania," giving the correspondence in relation to
                                        the enterprise, which resulted in the incorporation and
                                        establishment of this Cemetery. From the documents
                                        submitted, it will be seen that the amount originally
                                        assessed as the quota of Indiana in defraying the expenses
                                        of the undertaking was $4,625 83, in part payment of which
                                        the sum of $1,156 was, on the 1st day of June, 1864,
                                        remitted by the Governor to the Treasurer of the
                                        Association, leaving a balance of $3,469 80 still due from
                                        this State, for which last named sum requisitions have long
                                        since been made but have not been honored for want of the
                                        necessary appropriations to meet the requisitions.
                                        Gettysburg is the only battle-field of the late war in the
                                        North, and the remains of some eighty of the heroic soldiers
                                        of Indiana have <pb n="78" xml:id="VAA8558-08-078"/> been
                                        carefully interred in the National Cemetery, which has been
                                        established on the ground where they fell in the defense of
                                        the country. I respectfully recommend that immediate
                                        provision be made for the payment of the balance of the
                                        assessment originally made as the quota of this State,
                                        amounting, as before stated, to the sum of $3,469 80. It
                                        will be seen by Colonel Blake's report, that owing to
                                        the increased price of labor and materials, he estimates
                                        that the original assessment will be insufficient to meet
                                        our share of the cost of the undertaking by the sum of some
                                        $2,400. Whether an appropriation should be now made to meet
                                        this estimated deficit, is respectfully submitted to the
                                        General Assembly without any recommendation on that branch
                                        of the subject. Colonel Blake, with the patriotism and
                                        public spirit which has characterized his long and valuable

                        <p>Mr, CASON, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                            resolution of inquiry concerning the reduction of fare on railroads, not
                            to exceed three cents per mile; recommending that it lie on the table,

                        <p>Mr. CASON. The Committee thought it would be unconstitutional to attempt
                            to regulate the rates of fare of corporations having no such
                            restrictions in their charter. He did not think the Legislature should
                            take upon itself the control of the private affairs of corporations or
                            individuals.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS introduced a bill [H. R. 233] for an "act more
                            effectually to protect the people of the State of Indiana against losses
                            by fire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. H said there was quite a number of provisions in the bill. Its
                            general object being to pay the atnount of loss or damage by fire out of
                            the State Treasury, according to the amount for which such lost property
                            has been assessed for taxation. It was to accomplish quite a number of
                            objects. One was that all property be assessed at a fair valuation; and
                            another was that the taxes so assessed shall be paid. He moved that the
                            bill lie on the table and that 200 copies be printed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER thought he understood the bill. We have a law providing that

                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS said it involved a new principle of insurance. It would save

                            Companies. All such money so paid operated as a direct tax on the
                            people. He gave an example of the profits of true Goshen Mutual
                            Insurance Company, which in a few years reaped a profit of $30,000 which
                            was divided amongst the officers.</p>

                            State Librarian to draw from the State Treasury out of the moneys
                            appropriated for Legislative expenses the sum of $500, to procure

                        <p>Mr. KILGORE (by request) introduced a bill [H. R. 236] for an act to
                            amend the 23d section of the act for the incorporation of Insurance
                            Companiesdefining their powers and prescribing their duties; approved
                            June 17, 1852.</p>
                        <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>.</p>

                        <head rend="center">STATIONERY.</head>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON submitted a resolution reciting that the value of the amount
                            of stationery which each member and officer of the House is entitled to
                            receive is fifteen dollars and ten dollars, respectively; therefore,
                            resolved that the Librarian be required to charge members and officers
                            of the House the regular jobbing or wholesale price for stationery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. There had been no effort on the part of the Librarian to
                            charge more than the wholesale price.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON was informed by members of both Houses that for the best
                            article of legal cap the Librarian requires $12 a ream; for the next
                            best $10, and for Congress paper about the same. Now it was well known
                            that the best article of legal cap paper can be bought at Stewart &amp;
                            Bowen's, or at Merrill's, for $9 a ream, etc. At that rate of
                            charging, each member, instead of $15 would get about $10 or $12 worth
                            of stationery. He submitted that the Librarian has 20 right to go into a
                            speculation upon us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN thought there must be some mistake in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said the Librarian's explanation was that he
                            was not making a cent. There were about forty reams of paper in the
                            Library," purchased at cost, as it ruled at the last session. The
                            only question was whether the State or members should lose this
                            depreciation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN had long and well known the Librarian - could confide in his
                            honesty and integrity. He moved to lay the resolution on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was so ordered.</p>

                            was not satisfactory to to him, and being now in bad health, he
                            suggested that this labor be performed by the House. He would furnish
                            his skeleton to the committee. This principle was recognized in the
                            legislation of Congress. Passengers were frequently murdered in their
                            travel solely on account of defective moral or intellectual

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, (by unanimous consent,) called up the consideration of the

                            restriction was suspended, upon his statement and explanation of its
                            merits, and the bill was read the second time by title.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, the constitutional restriction was further

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH suggested that as this was a bill amending the Civil

                            referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, with

                        <p>Mr. SHUEY hoped the amendment would not prevail. The <orgName>Committee
                                on Education</orgName> did very little in this matter at the last

                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren's negro and mulatto school bill [H. R 208]
                            coming upwith the amendments and favorable report by the

                        <p>Mr. BURTON desired to have time and leave to submit a minority
                            report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved to recommit with instructions that the
                                <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName> inquire into the
                            expediency of reducing the present rate of taxation, 16 cents. We had
                            passed a bill for the distribution of the proceeds of the Sinking Fun,d,
                            which is the interest on about $4,000.000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS said the interest to be distributed would not exceed $10,000;
                            which increase would not add more than one school day in the year
                            throughout the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB then changed his motion to a motion to refer to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>. He stated his
                            knowledge that there were about $4,000,000 of these funds, the interest
                            on which would average 6 per cent. We had got along hitherto with a tax
                            often cents on the hundred dollars, and he had voted to raise it to 16
                            cents. He still thought that with the interest on these funds the tax
                            could be reduced again to 10 cents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved that the bill and instructions be referred to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS moved to lay Mr. Newcomb's motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. BROWN and GROVES demanded the yeas and nays, which resulted -
                            yeas 22, nays 58; so the House refused to lay the motion on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS desired to amend the motion, so that the Committee be
                            instructed further to report to-morrow morning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS demanded the yeas and nays, and they were ordered, and the
                            bill was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>
                            - yeas 52, nays 26.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURTON asked and obtained unanimous consent to submit a minority
                            report on the bill from the <orgName>Committee on Education</orgName>,
                            that it might go along with the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Ways
                                and Means</orgName>.The report reasons generally and particularly
                            against legislation for the benefit of the black race.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to refer the minority report to the <orgName>Committee on
                                Ways and Means</orgName> with the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to lay Mr. Brown's motion on the table. It would
                            be an insult to the Committee to send such a report.</p>
                        <p>On the question raised as to whether the majority report went with the
                            bill to the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said he did not move that.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Gregory of Warren in the Chair) held, that the motion
                            would govern the reference.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. If we are to be prohibited from expressing our views here as
                            Representatives of the people, it is time we should know it. He simply
                            but emphatically and firmly declared the rights of members in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE contemplated no insult. He understood that the House had the
                            right to disapprove and correct sentiments expressed in any report. In
                            this matter which requires no investigation - about which onr minds were
                            made up thoroughly - it was an insult to insist on a solemn
                            investigation before we can act upon it intelligently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN recited the object of the bill which had been referred. It
                            authorizes seperate schools for both white and black children. He
                            deprecated those who would elevate the African at the expense of the
                            free white people of the State. Instead of an insult, the minority
                            report looked to the protection of the white people of the State. Still
                            he had no idea that this subjected, inferior race would be elevated. The
                            superior race might be depressed and degraded, but the tendency of
                            placing the negro along side of the stronger race would be downward
                            continually. Even the negro himself had too much sense to be placed on
                            an equality with the white man.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE, withdrawing his motion to lay on the table, now moved to
                            reject the report of the minority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK rehearsed the provision, that school money for these colored
                            schools was to be distributed, not according to the taxes paid, but
                            according to the number of children. The motion to reject was made
                            because the matter of the report does, not meet the approval of the
                            gentleman from Delaware. He submitted to the will of the majority, but
                            if the minority were not to be heard in the unrestricted expression of
                            opinion, it was the end of legislation here, so far as he was
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY accorded to all minorities to make such reports as they please;
                            provided they are couched in respectful language. And if anything <pb n="82" xml:id="VAA8558-08-082"/> would lead him now to vote in favor
                            of this motion, and against his conviction, it woul be the implied
                            threat of bolting by the gentle man from Monroe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH interposed the consideratio that there was little
                            distinction between repressing a report and repressing debate. He
                            submitted a question of order under rule 32, contending that the motion
                            to refer has precedence over the motion to reject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. If by the rules, the majority may reject a report, that does
                            not afford a justification for bolting. He abhorred the sentiments of
                            the minority report, yet he should vote for its reference. He wanted it
                            to go to record as an emanation from the remains of the Democratic
                            party. As he had been educated so far from being degraded, a man is
                            elevated by his efforts to raise up the lowly and the help less.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE made the point, that it is not in order to reject any
                            proposition, except a bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE confessed the point and with drew the motion to reject. He
                            then renewed the motion to lay the motion to refer on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK submitted, that, as the majority report is not with the
                            Committee, there is no propriety in the reference of the minority
                            report.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays being taken thereon pending the call many members
                            explained that they voted in the affirmative, because the majority
                            report did not go with the bill to the Committee. Others contending that
                            the report went necessarily with the bill, and the majority report
                            simply recommended the passage of the bill, and the minority report was
                            held to be an amendment of the majority report. The vote resulted in a
                            refusal to lay on the table - yeas 34, nays 51.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS moved that both the majority and minority reports go to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>

                            returned the Senate bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_196">No.
                            196</ref>, with amendments and recommendations viz: First, that the bill
                            be reconsidered, and that it be amended by adding an emergency clause.
                            Secondly, amend the title so as to read, "An Act to amend the 716th
                            section of the General Practice Act of June 18, 1852, go as to deprive
                            the Supreme Court and the Judges thereof of original jurisdiction in
                            cases of writs of habeas corpus, and enlarging the powers of the Circuit
                            and Common Pleas Judges in relation thefeto, in this act provided and
                            prescribed."</p>
                        <p>The vote on the passage of the bill was reconsidered, and the first
                            amendment was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed further to amend by addings appropriately, this:
                            "Provided such jurisdiction shall not be taken away in cases now
                            pending." He stated that he desired to provide for the case of the
                            application from Ripley county before Judge Ray, which is set down for
                            to day; the witnesses are here, and it can be better and more
                            economically disposed of here bhan by sending back to the Circuit
                            Judges. Besides, he had understood that the local Circuit Judge had
                            declined to act in this case, and the Common Pleas Judge held that he
                            had no jurisdiction. So the applicant was compelled to come here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The case to which the gentleman referred would occupy the
                            Judge during the entire term of the Supreme Court, therefore he opposed
                            the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER inquired whether this case is from a distance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. From Ripley county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. The State pays no cost of witnesses, and it would be but
                            justice to the witnesses to send the case back, if the case is not soon
                            disposed of.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB understood that all the witnesses were not yet here; and
                            unless it could be disposed of before these amendments could go back for
                            the concurrence of the Senate, he thought it best that the case should
                            go back to the Circuit Judge.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's amendment was rejected. The bill, as proposed to be
                            amended by the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, was then again

                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's grand jury bill, No. 220, introduced the 18th inst.,
                            corning up on the second reading - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved that it be referred to the
                            <orgName>Judiciary</orgName>, with instructions to report ic back and
                            recommend its passage. He said the present grand juries have only
                            jurisdiction of felonies. The amendment here proposes to give to the
                            Circuit Court original exclusive jurisdiction of felonies, and
                            concurrent jurisdiction in the Common Pleas and Justice's Courts in
                            cases of misdemeanor. The new Constitution changed our Grand Jury
                            system, and we have tried the experiment thereon for twelve years. The
                            result has been that the men who commit misdemeanors, assault and
                            battery, or carry concealed weapons literally go untried and unpunished.
                            As the law now stands, if the rights of property of a citizen are
                            invaded, he has to complain himself, and generally employs a lawyer to
                            prosecute, on account of the inefficiency of prosecuting attorneys ; and
                            the result is that men suffer wrong rather than go to the trouble and
                            expense of a prosecution. It was a cruelty to punish men who commit
                            murder and steal, when the State permits the lesser offences to go
                            unpunished. We must commence with those who first violate the law. Some
                            poor man may be wronged, his property may be invaded ; and the man that
                            does it is powerful and vindictive. Therefore the poor man will not
                            commence a prosecution. Then let him go before the Grand Jury. In his
                            judgment the protection of the morals of our State require that Grand
                            Juries should have jurisdiction in the Common Pleas and Justice's
                            Courts. His Excellency Gov. Morton concurred in this view ; and when Mr.
                            B, went to his room to thank him for it, the Governor said he had been
                            too long a lawyer upon this question, but had learned that, if we would
                            protect our people, we must commence with those who are guilty of
                            misdemeanors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH agreed entirely with Mr. B. in the opinion, that our mode of
                            punishing misdemeanors, is simply licensing them. However, he did not
                            think it worth while to take a test vote, for he supposed there were not
                            five men in the House, who would vote against the bill. He suggested the
                            propriety of simply referring the bill to the <orgName>Committee on the
                                Judiciary</orgName>. He moved so to amend the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK accepted the modification, and the bill was referred to the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Commiittee</orgName>, without instructions.</p>

                        <p>Mr. COOK said that the law requires the Justice to furnish for his docket

                            hardship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES was opposed to laying this expense on the counties. He would
                            prefer to raise the fees of the Justices. He hoped the bill would be
                            postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS withdrew his motion to postpone, and moved that the bill be
                            laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE made an ineffectual motion to adjourn - affirmative 31,
                            negative 46.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH demanded the yeas and nays, which were ordered and taken,
                            and the House refused to lay the bill on the table - yeas 46, nays

                        <p>On motion by Mr. KILGORE, the House (at 4 1/2 p. M ) adjourned till

                            returned the bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_079">H. R. 79</ref>] to
                            amend <pb n="84" xml:id="VAA8558-08-084"/>the Supervisors' act of
                            March 5, 1859, with amendments thereto, recommending passage.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in, and the bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT moved to amend the bill so as to allow the Supervisor to
                            employ men to work out commutation money at wages not to exceed two
                            dollars per day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB was in favor of putting the figure at such an amount as will
                            compensate every man who performs labor on the highways. No better
                            safeguard can be thrown around officers than to make the law clear.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT. No Supervisor ought to be allowed to pay more than the man
                            pays who does not work his road tax out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN thought there should be some discretion left with the officer
                            - the people themselves can regulate these things.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. The amount of commutation money should be the standard to pay
                            for work on the road.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON was anxious that this bill should become a law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG was willing to leave discretionary power in the hands of the
                            Supervisor, and would be glad to see the amendment passed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS would leave it altogether discretionary with the Supervisor,
                            and moved to strike from the amendment the words "not to exceed two
                            dollars."</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. CULLEN, this amendment was laid on the table upon a
                            division - affirmative 21; negative 18. And the amendment was laid on
                            the table by yeas 29, nays 13.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND moved to increase the price of commutation from $1 50 to $3

                                        attention to the necessities of the speedy establishment of
                                        an institution in which Indiana soldiers and seamen,
                                        disabled by wounds or disease contracted in the service of
                                        the United States, shall be cared for and maintained during

                                        United States General Hospital at Jeffersonville is one of
                                        the most complete establishments of the kind in the country,
                                        and is well adapted to the purposes of a Soldiers'
                                        Home, and that he had written to the Secretary of War and
                                        Surgeon General for information as to whether the Government
                                        would be willing to turn over this hospital to the State of
                                        Indiana, to be used in the establishment of such an
                                        institution, should the State desire it, and that the
                                        answer, when received, would be communicated to the General

                                        his letter of inquiry mentioned in his message, in which it
                                        is stated that upon application to that effect by the State
                                        of Indiana, the Surgeon General will recommend that the
                                        general hospital at Jeffersonville be turned over to the
                                        State authorities upon the same terms as the Tripler
                                        Hospital was turned over to the State of Ohio. A copy of
                                        this communication from the Surgeon General's office is
                                        herewith respectfully submitted.I have no difinite
                                        information as to the terms upon which Tripler Hospital was
                                        turned over to the State of Ohio, but believe that the only
                                        terms required was a guarantee on the part of the State that
                                        the property donated should be faithfully applied to carry
                                        out the object for which it was given.</p>
                                    <p>I have written to the Surgeon General since the receipt of
                                        this communication for information as to the precise terms
                                        upon which Tripler Hospital was donated to the State of
                                        Ohio. If the land upon which the General Hospital at
                                        Jeffersonville is situated, comprising, as I am informed,
                                        about one hundred and sixty acres, can be procured for a
                                        reasonable price, this offer of the government to turn over
                                        the Hospital buildings, with the appurtenances, would seem
                                        to afford a solution of the Soldiers' Home question, so
                                        far as its location is concerned. Indeed, if such an
                                        institution is to be at all provided by the State or the
                                        people, and of this I do not permit myself to doubt, we can
                                        not afford to decline the offer of buildings and
                                        improvements of the value of not less than three hundred
                                        thousand dollars, adapted to the accomplishment of the very
                                        object we have in view, whether the owners of the land will
                                        or will not consent to sell the land for a reasonable price.
                                        If they refuse thus to sell, the remedy of the State is
                                        plain. It is to provide, by Legislative enactment, for the
                                        taking of the property, and for the assessment of the just
                                        compensation to which the owners would be entitled under the
                                        Constitution. With these suggestions, the whole subject is
                                        again commended to your careful consideration.</p>

                                        the terms upon which Tripler Hospital was turned over to the
                                        State of Ohio, it will be communicated to the General

                            (described in these Reports of Nov. 14,) recommending indefinite
                            postponement of No. 197 and the passage of <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_198">No. 198</ref>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CORBIN. One of the strongest arguments used by its friends in fayor
                            of the passage of the bill for the relief of the families of soldiers,
                            was that the burthens should be equally distributed; but where is the
                            equality of the distribution now? And where is the theory they urged
                            with so much vehemence, when they now come in and propose to repeal that
                            law, and when they vote down almost unanimously an amendment proposinr
                            to put it upon the same ground they urge as a reason why the bill should
                            pass? If it was just to make an equal distribution at the time of the
                            passage of the bill, upon what ground has it ceased, and why should
                            there not be an equality of distribution now? If there was justice in it
                            then, there is justice in it now. There is reason why the bill should be
                            repealed, but there is a great injustice in not having that fund
                            distributed in accordance with the provisions of the law. And then there
                            has been a species of log rolling for the passage of this bill. The
                            petitions presented here were printed in Indianapolis, and they have
                            been sent to every county in the State. Here is where the whole thing
                            originated. They were printed at the <hi rend="i">Journal office</hi> -
                            all there petitions were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. The reason we want to repeal this bill now is that the war
                            for which it was made and designed is over, and there are not now the
                            number of beneficiaries there were before. I knew the counties of Union
                            and Fayette would pay a greater amount into the State Treasury than they
                            would receive from it, but I thought it nevertheless my duty to vote for
                            the bill. There being no soldiers now to pay it out to, the surplus
                            money put into the Treasury from such counties as Union and Fayette will
                            go into the Treasury of Marshall or some other county, and there be used
                            as other county monies, and to that I am opposed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN (interposing). The expenditure has already been made for the
                            support of these families, and that county perhaps may be in debt to the
                            amount required under the provisions of this bill, and why should the
                            money be withheld?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. If the war had continued, and the soldiers remained in the
                            field up to this day, it would be wrong to change it; but it has
                            happened fortunately for this country that these soldiers have come
                            home; and it is not possible that the people have expended all the money
                            they would have expended had the war continued to this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN (interposing). If it is right provided they have paid it all,
                            is it not half right if they have paid half?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. If they have expended more money than they have collected
                            there might be some reason in the argument; but unless they have
                            violated this law, they have not paid out more than has been
                            collected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER remarked that the question was on the passage of the bill, and
                            the necessity for it, he thought, was felt by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON was heartily in favor of the passage of the bill. The bill
                            was finally passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 1.</p>

                            was taken up on the second reading.</p>
                        <p>It was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB now moved a suspension of the constitutional restriction, to
                            enable him to move the third reading of the bill to-day. He read from
                            the remarks of Senator Brown, of Wells, thereon, as in the BREVIER
                            REPORTS of the last session of the General Assembly, showing how
                            divorces are procured by means of divorce agencies. And from
                            conversation with members from the northeast part of the State, he found
                            these statements fully sustained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE'S first objection to the bill was that it strikes down
                            uniformity in pleadings. That was his main objection. He knew that a
                            very wrongful system of practice had been gotten up by attorneys in
                            these cases so as to get them referred and decided by themselves. It was
                            not only wrongful but villainous, involving perjury. Such a system had
                            no doubt prevailed im some parts of the State, It was a disgrace to the
                            Courts and the profession of the law. But it seemed to him there were
                            other and better means of reaching these cases by criminal law - those
                            men who regard oaths so lightly - let them be reached by the criminal
                            law. He thought, therefore, there was 110 necessity for this bill. There
                            was sometimes a necessity for referees - where there is an honorable
                            Court and honorable attorneys - the reference saves the Judges a great
                            deal of time and trouble and facilitates business. He would not strike
                            down this principle of uniformity in procedures because a few
                            unprincipled lawyers and Judges abuse it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. His friend admits the evil, but fails to suggest any other
                            remedy than the one proposed in this bill. Until his friend proposes a
                            better, he considered it was best to pass this bill. This practice of
                            referees in these cases was unknown in his part of the State. We ought
                            to put a stop to this obtaining divorces by fraud and perjury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. Uniformity is the beauty and boast of the laws and practice
                            of the State of Indiana, It had worked an immense benefit to the State
                            and people, and if we lose sight of this principle we shall soon get
                            into confusion and embarrassment from one end of the State to the other.
                            He never heard of the practice of referring these cases in his
                            district.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, demanded the previous question; and the main
                            question, to-wit: Shall the bill pass? was ordered.</p>
                        <p>It was passed by the House of Representatives without amendment - yeas,
                            72; nays 12; <pb n="88" xml:id="VAA8558-08-088"/> the title: To amend
                            Section 349 of the Civil Procedure Act of June 18,1852.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER explained his vote. The bill was wrong in principle. Its very
                            heading shows that practice and pleading shall be uniform in all our
                            courts. This made exceptions. He thought it very doubtful whether we
                            could do this under the Constitution. He voted no.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSWELL explained. This bill of the Senator from Wells - his county -
                            was gotten up to cure an evil which existed only in the 10th Judicial
                            Circuit. This thing of referring divorce cases to attorneys was
                            introduced and practiced by a judge that the people had got rid of. And
                            now he did not think there was any occasion for the passage of this
                            law.</p>
                        <p>The passage of the bill was then announced as above.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shuey's Liquor Law amendment bill [H. R. 218] amending sections
                            3 and 4, and providing penaltiescoming up - with a recommendation by the
                                <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>, to amend, by striking
                            out the words, "of good moral character."</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said the Committee recommended to lay that on the table. There
                            was an amendment reported. It was ascertained by reference to the
                            Journal of Monday: Insert after the word "petition" this:
                            "In the absence of other substantial proof."</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS proposed to amend the amendment of the Committee by striking
                            out the words, "at least one half of the legal voters," and
                            inserting this: "A majority of the inhabitants exceeding fourteen
                            years of age." There were some transactions in society in which
                            women were as much interested as men. They suffer more from dissipated
                            men than the legal voters in the township or ward; and it seemed to him
                            that they should be consulted in the matter of resisting this tide of
                            evil. A woman of good ordinary sense has the capacity of judging in this
                            matter; and little boys and girls are just as able to decide upon it as
                            their father or any legal voter. He would therefore require that their
                            names be attached to the petition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. TRUSLER (interposing) how will it be determined when they get a
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. He would provide for that by another amendment, to this
                            effect: The applicant shall be required to make proof that he has a
                            majority of all such persons, He did not propose to have this determined
                            negatively, but he would put the <hi rend="i">onusprobandi</hi> upon the
                            applicant, to prove that his petition is signed by a majority of all the
                            inhabitants over fourteen years of age.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH was in favor of the principle of the amendment. He submitted
                            whether it would not be more effective to say, "A majority of all
                            the inhabitants over eighteen years."</p>
                        <p>Mr. ROACH thought not; but that fourteen years were sufficientknowing
                            just as well what the consequences will be if they sign, or forbear to
                            sign it. They will readily know that if groceries are established, their
                            neighbors and fathers and brothers will be dragged down to ruin. And in
                            view of the fact that they are directly the sufferers, it was eminently
                            proper that they should be consulted as to the license. With such an
                            amendment we would have all the guards we could obtain by legislation
                            against this traffic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN made the point that the amendment of Mr. Roach is not in order,
                            because of the pendency of two amendments when his amendment was
                            presented.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER ruled, that amendments not recommended by the Committee fall.
                            He referred to the 58th rule, - second paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ZEIGLER said the object of the bill was to accomplish a certain end.
                            Would a petition from women and children have as much influence with
                            County Commissioners as the petition of voters?</p>
                        <p>Mr. ROACH. The question of numbers, not influence, is to decide the
                            question of license.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ZEIGLER still contended that influence was in the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK understood the general purpose to be to protect minors, etc.
                            As for men, they will get liquor if they want it. He was opposed to
                            minors, and women being introduced into our political struggles. But as
                            to young men and boys voting, there was not a town in the State which
                            you can not obtain a majority of these boys and young men in favor of
                            license. He also spoke against the amendment which will probably yet be
                            proposed by the gentleman from Henry.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART hoped that this bill would not be encumbered with
                            amendments. There were eight licensed groceries in his town Waterloo,
                            DeKalb countyand two of them obtained license against the remonstrance
                            of every person in the town. He made no temperance speech, but was not
                            without feeling in the matter. Let us have an efficient bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay Mr. Roach's amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was so ordered - affirmative, 69; negative, 5.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to further amend by striking out the word
                            "white," in 86th line of the 3d section.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH was not in favor of extending any further privileges to the
                            black race; neither did he want to degrade them. Therefore, he would
                            move to lay Mr. Brown's amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was laid on the table - yeas 58; nays 23.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE proposed to amend further by striking out all that relates to
                            signers of petitions in the towns. His object was to leave this matter
                            to the township; for he would have no fears then that groceries would
                            annoy people living in the country. He was personally opposed to
                            licensing the traffic at all. He recited a case where a man in his
                            county obtained license against the unanimous remonstrance of the
                            township. It showed the necessity of more stringent legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said the bill was a compromise between the radicals on this
                            question, and the friends of the present law. He would have the assent
                            of all the legal voters. But we got the best bill we could. He was
                            satisfied that the <pb n="89" xml:id="VAA8558-08-089"/> friends of
                            prohibition would get more by adopting this bill in its present shape,
                            than they conld in any other way. He hoped the friends of the bill would
                            not tear it in pieces and destroy its efficiency by amendments. It had
                            been carefully examined in committee, and had the approbation of
                            Attorney General Williamson. It provides that the County Commissioners
                            in order to ascertain whether a majority have signed the petition shall
                            go to the returns of the last preceding general election " in the
                            absence of other sufficient proof."</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH was in favor of the amendment of the gentleman from Putnam
                            (Mr. Lane.) The gentleman from Elkhart (Mr. Shuey) had said it was a
                            compromise, and questioned whether we could pass it with radical
                            elements in it. He was willing to try it. He recited the incident of the
                            women of his town conspiring against the groceries and turning out all
                            the whisky their barrels contained; and when they were fined for the
                            invasion the fine was paid by a voluntary subscription. He wanted to
                            "provide as much as possible againt the evils of intemperance, and
                            therefore he would adhere to the amendment of the gentleman from Putnam
                            (Mr. Lane.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL referred to a township in his county casting about 800 votes,
                            with a little town in it casting not more than seventy-five or eighty
                            votes. He was of opinion that there might be a majority of that town who
                            would sign a petition to authorize the traffic, whilst if it were left
                            to the people of the township the applicant could not get one-fourth of
                            the voters. For the protection of the people of that township and every
                            other township, he insisted that Mr. Lane's amendment was a very
                            proper one to be incorporated into this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BONNER spoke also in favor of Mr. Lane's amendment. He gave
                            particulars about Greensburgh to justify his vote in that direction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GOODMAN moved an adjournment.</p>

                                    <p>I beg leave respectively to call your attention to the
                                        propriety of passing a joint resolution asking Congress to
                                        make a "donation of lands to the Company incorporated
                                        under the laws of this State to construct a harbor a
                                        Michigan City.</p>
                                    <p>Some forty years ago there was cut off from the Territory of
                                        Michigan of a strip of land ten miles in width, which was
                                        added to the State of Indiana, for the purpose of affording
                                        her a Lake Harbor. For the purpose of constructing a harbor
                                        at Michigan City, the Government made appropriations
                                        extending through a series of years, amounting in the
                                        aggregate to about $135,000, but these were given in such
                                        small sums, and at intervals so distant from each other, as
                                        to render them comparatively ineffectual.</p>
                                    <p>Yet, with all these drawbacks, a harbor was made which, for
                                        some years, gave to our State quite an amount of shipping.
                                        On the completion of the Michigan Central Railroad, the
                                        harbor at Michigan City was abandoned by the Government, and
                                        for want of repairs, and being exposed to the storms of the
                                        Lake, the upper works which had been erected were gradually
                                        loosened and fell, and the sand drifting across the cribs,
                                        finally choked up the mouth of the creek, and the harbor
                                        became inaccessible to any but small fishing vessels.
                                        Citizens of Indiana, convinced that the State should have a
                                        port on our great inland seas, as well as Ohio and Illinois,
                                        formed a Company under the laws of the State, for the
                                        purpose of rebuilding this harbor. To this Company Congress
                                        ceded all the Government work that remained, and gave
                                        permission for the work to be prosecuted, as had already
                                        been successfully done by a Company at Milwaukee, under a
                                        like cession by the Government. The Michigan City Harbor
                                        Company are thoroughly organized and already stock has been
                                        subscribed to the enterprise, amounting to $135,000, and
                                        assurances have been received by the Company that the L. N.
                                        A. &amp; C. R. R. Co. will take stock to the amount of
                                        $100,000, so soon as it is ascertained that the balance
                                        necessary to complete the work can be procured.</p>

                                        estimated that the entire amount required to complete and
                                        secure to our State a permanent Lake Harbor, will not exceed
                                        $300,000.</p>
                                    <p>On the benefits to be derived by our State from the
                                        establishment of a Port of Entry and Departure, on its
                                        Northern borders, it is difficult to place too high an
                                        estimate. In the transportation of wheat from points north
                                        of the Wabash, fifteen cents per bushel will be saved to the
                                        producer, that being the difference between Railroad and

                                        extensively used by our packers, with this harbor completed,
                                        could be delivered at Michigan City as cheaply as at
                                        Chicago, thereby resulting in an immense saving to the

                                        shipping their crude ore to this State for that purpose, and
                                        thereby furnish a market for the coal and iron deposits of
                                        our State. There would also be a saving of some <pb n="90" xml:id="VAA8558-08-090"/> forty per cent, on pine

                                        from the construction of a harbor on its northern borders, a
                                        few of them only have been alluded to. In asking Congress
                                        togrant to the Company a donation of lands, toaid in the
                                        construction of the harbor, the General Assembly would only
                                        be soliciting that numerous precedents furnished by land
                                        appropriations in aid of other public works should be
                                        followed. I respectfully recommend the passage of a joint

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            hour, being the bill S. 126 to amend An Act regulating fees and
                            salaries, approved March 2, 1855.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT said this was a people's bill, and explained why the
                            advance in each particular fee is made. Where the bill refers to
                            Prosecuting Attorney's fees, they are doubled. Constable's
                            fees, in most of the particulars, named, are increased one-half; and so
                            are the fees of Justice's of the Peace. Juror's and and
                            witnesses' fees are increased about one-third, and the Coroners are
                            allowed five cents for mileage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE moved to strike out all that refers to raising the per diem of
                            County Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that he opposed the bill for a general increase of
                            fees and salaries which was pending at the last session; but the office
                            of County Commissioner is a very important one and we need the best men
                            we have among us to fill it. He did not think we ought to ask men
                            competent for such an office to give their time to the public for less
                            than five dollars a day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON. The Commissioner is one of the most important, if not the
                            most important office in the county, and unless you pay enough to
                            command the attention of good men the result will be a bad management of
                            county affairs.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BENNETT - yeas, 32; nays 11 - the amendment was laid on
                            the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MASON moved to strike out "five" and insert
                            "four" where it refers to the per diem of the County
                            Commissioner.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BENNETT this amendment was laid on the table by yeas 22;
                            nays 29.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB moved to strike out the fee allowed to prosecuting attorneys for
                            appearing in divorce cases, where thev are not successful. If successful
                            he was willing they should be paid for the defensethe present law makes
                            it their duty to defend all such cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER was favorable to the idea of giving the prosecuting attorney
                            ten dollars if successful, and no fee if not successful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. There are no kind of cases in this State in which we are so
                            much imposed on as these divorce cases, and we ought to have them
                            attended to by the prosecuting attorney.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved to strike out all that refers to prosecuting
                            attorneys. He thought the fees already provided are ample.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER hoped the amendment was not to be adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG confessed, as a necessary order of things, in consequence of
                            the meagre pay of prosecuting attorneys, that the office is filled with
                            a third or fourth rate class of legal talent. This should be remedied;
                            and he was, therefore, in favor of raising the fees of prosecuting
                            attorneys in every possible way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES believed an increase of fees were really due to prosecuting
                            attorneys; that it would be productive of great public benefit if they
                            were better paid.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was rejected upon a division - affirmative 16, negative
                            20.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to amend so that prosecuting attorneys shall
                            receive a fee of $10 in all cases for Divorce. The law provides that the
                            prosecuting attorney shall only appear where there is no attorney
                            employed for the defense; and that only occurs in fraudulent divorce
                            cases. This amendment would add another check to this class of
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. OYLER the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT moved to amend by allowing the Prosecuting Attorney ten
                            dollars if successful. This fee will come off of persons seeking
                            divorces, and they are the ones who should pay and are generally willing
                            to pay well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES and Mr. MASON favored the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB doubted its propriety.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON was anxious to see the divorce law of the State remodeled;
                            but thought wrong to speak of parties who may apply for divorces as
                            persons committing a crime. The avenues to justice on this point should
                            be as open and as fair as in any other, and he opposed the blocking up
                            of the way with any unnecessary fees.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to upon a division - Affirmative 20; negative
                            19.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DYKES moved to amend by increasing the jurors' fee from $1 50 to
                            $2 00 per day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT. There ought to be a difference between the fee of jurors who
                            live in town and those who live in the country, and the proper way will
                            be to add mileage to the fee. </p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON suggested the difficulty where a juror lives only a mile or
                            two from town; in which case the mileage would amount to nothing, and
                            yet the juror would have to board in town. He preferred $2 a day for
                            them all, and then add mileage if Senators see fit.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to, by yeas 31, nays 12.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then ordered engrossed for the third reading.</p>

                                    <p>I herewith respectfully transmit a communication from the
                                        Treasurer, Auditor and Secretary of State, and the Clerk of
                                        the Supreme Court, in relation to the exposed condition of
                                        the public records, archives and papers of the State,
                                        especially as pertaining to the offices of the Auditor,
                                        Treasurer and Secretary of State. In consideration of the
                                        inevitable burdens in the shape of taxation, which must be
                                        borne by the public for some years to come, I would gladly
                                        avoid, if a sense of duty would permit, any suggestion, the
                                        effect of which might be to increase the levy for State
                                        purposes. But when the extreme clanger of destruction to
                                        which the public records are now exposed, and the fact that
                                        the rents now paid for rooms and offices would in a few
                                        years procure safe depositories, and the additional fact
                                        that the value of these records oan not be estimated in
                                        dollars and cents are all considered, sound economy as well
                                        as duty to the public would seem to require that some action
                                        should speedily be taken to avert so great a calamity as the
                                        destruction of the archives of the State would be. It will
                                        be seen by the communication before referred to and herewith
                                        transmitted, that the State officers suggest two distinct
                                        plans for providing offices, without expressing a preference
                                        for either. One of these plans is to purchase the Banking
                                        House at the intersection of Illinois street and Kentucky
                                        avenue, the other to build new offices on the grounds owned
                                        by the State, immediately north of the State House. I have
                                        given the subject some consideration, and, in my judgment,
                                        safety, economy, and good policy would dictate the purchase
                                        of the building before mentioned, if it can be procured on
                                        reasonable terms. The consideration in its favor are that
                                        without any addition thereto, it is believed the building
                                        could be made to accommodate the Auditor, Treasurer and
                                        Secretary of State on the first floor, and furnish a room
                                        for each of the Judges of the Supreme Court and an audience
                                        room for their consultations and for the hearing of oral
                                        arguments, on the second floor. It also contains two
                                        superior vaults, in which the more valuable of the public
                                        records could be kept.</p>
                                    <p>It is isolated and comparatively free from exposure to fire,
                                        and possessing a metallic roof in view of its position might
                                        almost be considered as fire proof.</p>
                                    <p>By its purchase the public records could at once be removed
                                        to a place of security, the payment of rents for rooms and
                                        offices would at once cease, and the General Assembly would
                                        at the outset know the whole amount necessary to be expended
                                        to accomplish the object.</p>
                                    <p>Besides all this if the lot and building should be purchased
                                        at a fair price and the State should hereafter not need the
                                        same, there is not even a remote probability that the
                                        property could not at any future time be sold for its
                                        original cost. If, however, on the other hand, the plan of
                                        building offices should be adopted, the building would not
                                        probably be completed short of a year from this time, during
                                        which rents would continue to be paid, and the public
                                        records would continue to be exposed to destruction. The
                                        expenditure also would doubtless be much greater than would
                                        be required to purchase the building before alluded to, and
                                        whatever the estimates might be, the ultimate actual cost of
                                        the building would be a matter of conjecture, and would
                                        never be ascertained until the work was completed. At my
                                        request a diagram has been prepared, showing the number and
                                        situation of the rooms and vaults of the Bank building
                                        before mentioned, and also the size and shape of the lot
                                        upon which it is situated, which diagram is herewith
                                        respectfully submitted. In view of the whole subject, I
                                        earnestly recommend that a Joint Committee of both Houses be
                                        at once appointed to visit and inspect the offices of the
                                        Auditor, Treasurer and Secretary of State, and their
                                        surroundings, to inquire into the amount of rents paid by
                                        these officers, and by the judges of the Supreme Court for
                                        their Chambers, and to consider the suggestions of the State
                                        officers contained in the communication herewith submitted,
                                        with instructions to the Committee to report at an early day
                                        in favor of such action as all the circumstances and the

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN explained the importance of the early passage of the bill, and
                            moved that it be considered as engrossed and read the third time
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK knew of a hardship or two that would be brought about by
                            the passage of this bill, to which he would like to call the attention
                            of the Committee; and therefore he would like to have the bill
                            recommitted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER could see 110 good that would grow out of the delay; although
                            he would not make any serious objection to the motion to recommit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK mentioned a case or two where this bill would operate
                            unjustly. Persons living near a town or near where these roads converge
                            - their property is liable to be taxed twice or thrice over without
                            receiving a corresponding benefit. Then it would be well to have at
                            least two grades of taxation; let the property within a half mile of the
                            road be taxed a certain rate, and property between a half and a mile
                            from the road, a lesser rate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. Efforts to make a graduated tax in such cases have so far
                            failed - you cannot make a law that would be general and just on this
                            subject, because the price of construction of roads differ in different
                            localities. He would gladly co-operate with the Senator in an amendment
                            that would obviate the difficulty mentioned.</p>
                        <p>After further remarks by Messrs. VAN BUSKIRK, CULLEN and MASON - </p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK withdrew his expressed desire for a recommitment.</p>
                        <p>The motion to consider the bill engrossed being agreed to, it was read
                            the third time and finally passed the Senate by yeas 40, nays 1.</p>

                        <p>Mr. RICE presented a memorial for the repeal of the black laws, and for

                        <p>Mr. BURTON presented the petition of Nathan Brown, an old and respected
                            citizen of his county, who thinks he has discovered the true cause of
                            milk-sick, asking the Legislature to make him a reward for his
                            discovery. He moved to refer the memorial to a special committee of
                            three with powers to investigate, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE moved to lay the memorial on the table. He thought if this
                            respectable old man had really made this valuable discovery, and was
                            withholding it from the world, he must be a very bad man.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURTON demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE then withdrew the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SULLIVAN, of Scott, proposed to increase the number of the committee

                        <p>Mr. R. also returned Mr. Thacher's bill [H. R. 157] to amend section
                            21 of the act regulating descents, &amp;c., approved May 14,1852,
                            recommending indefinite potponement. He said it was the opinion of the
                            committee that the widow is already entitled to the deficit of the three
                            hundred dollars out of the real estate if there is not enough of the
                            personal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. It was the opinion of the courts and lawyers in his district,
                            that the widow is hot so entitled; and where the law is doubtful he
                            thought we ought to enact one that is positive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. A decision of the Supreme Court under the law of 1843
                            (similar to the present law,) is to the effect that the widow is not
                            entitled to this deficit out of the realty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. But had not the Supreme Court more recently decided that the
                            widow is entitled to the dificit of $800 out of any money on hand, or
                            out of money derived from the sale of real estate?</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE thought not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER concurred with Mr. Buskirk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN was of the same opinion. A rightful interpretation of the
                            Statutes could lead to no other conclusion. He was opposed to
                            encumbering the Statutes with matter that makes no change in the
                            law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. Judge Stuart, of his district, was of opinion that the
                            widow is not entitled to the deficit of $300 out of the realty. He gave
                            instances of hardships to widowrs under the present law. He would give
                            her this $300 at all events. He moved that the bill be referred to a
                            select committee of three.</p>

                        <p>Mr. MEREDITH suggested, a return to the vote by which the House concurred
                            in the indefinite postponement of Mr. Spencer's bill. He did not
                            want to slaughter bills without consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER, Mr. GREGORY of Warren and Mr. HUMPHREYS each spoke to the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER moved a reconsideration of the vote by which the House
                            concurred in the report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE said that the Committee had reported adversely to the bill
                            because the fees of the administrator ($1 50 a day) were inadequate.
                            Where there was inadequate pay, you could not get competent men. The
                            executor or administrator should be paid according to the amount of the
                            estate and the intricacies attending the settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER said an amendment could be made in regard to compensation. A
                            Committee could fix the fees as well as the Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. What becomes of the fees when the estate will not pay them? He
                            did not think that the Legislature could properly fix a rate of
                            compensation; the duties were so various. In one case the estate may be
                            able to pay, and in another, where the labor is the same, the estate is
                            not able to pay. The law should be that the judges should make
                            allowances to the lawyers and administrators in the settlement of
                            estates. Lie thought we had better introduce a resolution discharging
                            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> and referring the bill to the
                            gentleman from Posey (Mr. Spencer.) He moved to lay the motion to
                            reconsider on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was so ordered - affirmative 66, negative 9.</p>

                        <p>Mr. MEREDITH being entitled to the floor, tread a speech in favor of the

                            John Pettit had changed his views on this question. He was now a
                            petitioner before this House for the repeal of the Black laws. Mr.
                            Blythe had also changed, and there was little doubt but if Mr. Rariden
                            had lived to this day, he would stand with Mr. Pettit to-day on this
                            question. Wise men sometimes change their minds - fools never. Since the

                            Union, and now all the loyalty of the land are determined to dispose of
                            the institution at once and forever. Where was the justice in trampling
                            on the rights of the negro? They were God-given, and should be held
                            sacred by all honorable men. It had been suggested that all that is
                            required on this question is the abrogation of the laws made in
                            pursuance of this 13th Article; but he would have the abrogation of the
                            article itself. He deprecated the disabilities of the negroes under the
                            black laws, from considerations drawn from the heroic valor evinced by
                            them in the war which has put down the late rebellion. He combatted the
                            proposition of Mr. Buskirk, that the two races could not live together
                            prosperously. The negro should at least have the right to make
                            contracts, and to have a home on our soil. Not long since the
                            gentleman's party alleged that the negro was worthless in war; but
                            now he was alarmed at his prowess - alarmed at a vision of the negro
                            host charging upon him for social equality and amalgamation. The repeal
                            of this article would not give the negro the right of suffrage, nor the
                            benefit of the common schools. In conclusion, he rehearsed the tedious
                            routine through which a proposition to amend the Constituion would have
                            to pass, before the object could be consummated, alleging that it was a
                            measure evidently dictated by the civilization of the age:</p>

                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART acquiesced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren,renewed the demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN submitted that the proper mode of amendment to the Constitution
                            was by a concurrent resolution; not by a joint resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS made the point of order that the yeas and nays could not be
                            taken on a demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Miller in the Chair) held that the point was well
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN appealed from the decision of the Chair.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren, withdrew the demand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved to postpone the further consideration of the special
                            order till seven o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH and Mr. LOPP opposed the motion.</p>
                        <p>The motion to postpone was rejected - affirmative 47; negative 34.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER decided the demand for the yeas and nays to be out of
                            order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN appealed</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEMCOMB deprecated the gag and cutting off debate on these important
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK stated that the yeas and nays were admissible on seconding
                            the previous question, but not on the next succeeding question, viz:
                            Shall the main question be now put?</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER thereupon changed the ruling, and the yeas and nays were
                            ordered, and being taken, the House refused to second the previous
                            question - yeas, 17; nays, 72.</p>
                        <p>[A message was received from the Acting Governor, by C. P. Jacobs, his
                            private Secretary, transmitting a communication from the Treasurer,

                        <p>Mr. HARRISON said: As one of the minority of the <orgName>Committee on
                                Constitutional Amendments</orgName>, I deem it due to myself, and
                            especially to the constituency that I have the honor in part to
                            represent, that I should state my objections to the passage of the Joint
                            Resolution under consideration. The resolution proposes an amendment to
                            the Constitution of the State, by striking from that instrument the
                            Thirteenth Article thereof, which prohibits negroes or mulattos from
                            coming into, or settling in the State after its adoption. A period of
                            about fourteen years has elapsed since the article inaugurating this
                            policy was separately submitted to a vote of the peopto under the title
                            of Exclusion and Colonization of Negroes. It is matter of history how
                            emphatically it was approved by the popular voice, there being over
                            ninety thousand majority <pb n="95" xml:id="VAA8558-08-095"/> in its
                            favor. There are two questions that naturally arise in the argument of
                            this question. First, what were the circumstances existing at the time
                            that rendered its adoption necessary? And secondly, do not the same
                            circumstances and necessity that existed at that time still exist?</p>
                        <p>The answer to the first question as to why existing circumstances
                            rendered the adoption of the 13th article of the Constitution necessary?
                            can perhaps better be found in the debates and arguments of many of the
                            very able men who were members of the Constitutional Convention than
                            elsewhere, and certainly than in anything that I might say. The
                            gentleman from Monroe (Mr. Buskirk) in his very able speech on Tuesday
                            last, quoted and set forth at some length extracts from several of the
                            speeches and arguments of some of the ablest members of the Convention,
                            and I shall not attempt to elaborate upon the circumstances and reasons
                            assigned by them for their action in recommending the adoption of a
                            constitutional policy so clearly conducive to the separation and
                            ultimate prosperity of both races, further than that the circumstances
                            then existing demanded (as in my humble judgment they still do) that
                            Indiana should not be flooded and overrun with a vagabond population of
                            negroes and mulatoes, to their own detriment and well-being, to corrupt,
                            contaminate and demoralize our people, and to compete with and degrade
                            the labor of our foreign-born white citizens. I do not propose to argue
                            the question of the inferiority of the negro; that can be better done by
                            some one more competent to the task. I believe it is a conceded fact
                            that human nature is the same at all times, and that truth is immutable
                            and unchangeable. Ethnology, or the history of the different races of
                            men, has assigned to the negro a place in the scale of human
                            intelligence, of progress and of civilization, from which human laws and
                            association can not exempt him. I, sir, am not one of those, if any such
                            there be, who hate and despise the negro, because of his inferiority and
                            his color, for the very good reason, that that is something he is not
                            responsible for. Had he have been consulted in that regard, it would
                            perhaps have been ordered otherwise. The Preamble to the Constitution
                            sets forth briefly and concisely its objects and purposes, in these
                            words: To the end that justice be established, public order maintained,
                            and liberty perpetuated; "We, the People of the State of Indiana,
                            grateful to Almighty God for the free exercise of the right to choose
                            our own form of Government, do ordain this Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Will justice be more securely established, public order more effectually
                            maintained, or liberty more permanently perpetuated, by striking from
                            the Constitution the 13th Article thereof? It does seem to me, Sir, that
                            no better plan could be devised to produce public disorder, disorganize
                            society, and to spread demoralization among our people, than to increase
                            our negro population. The adoption of the joint resolution under
                            consideration, will most assuredly have that efffect by breaking down
                            the constitutional barrier and inviting hither swarms of this worthless
                            class of persons to us. In an economical and industrial point of view,
                            this measure is inexpedient and can not be desirable to our people. The
                            industry and labor of the North should be fostered and protected, and
                            not embarrassed and degraded by an element of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The labor of our foreign white population and increase of all our white
                            population is profitable in the North, while the labor of the negro is
                            profitable in the South, and is not in the North, hence it is the
                            manifest interest of both sections, and both races, that the negro
                            remain in the South where the climate is congenial to him and where his
                            labor cannot well be dispensed with. His Excellency, the Governor, in
                            his message both at the regular and present session, recommended the
                            establishment of a Bureau of Foreign Emigration in Europe, with an
                            agency attached, in order to facilitate emigration to our State, in
                            order to supply a deficiency among our laboring classes. In view of this
                            the adoption of the resolution under consideration is not in my judgment
                            advisable, for the reason that this measure will be an obstacle in the
                            way of foreign emigration to our State. The industrious German and Irish
                            emigrant would not regard our State as a favorable location when they
                            learn that their labor will come in competition with and will be
                            degraded by the labor of the negro. If,however,the resolution must pass
                            at this time, I would suggest that it is defective and does riot go far
                            enough,it should have recommended a Bureau of Negro Emigration in the
                            Southern States, in order to meet and counteract the Foreign Bureau of
                            Emigration recommended by His Excellency the Governor. I am aware that
                            it is assumed by some that negroes are citizens. I deny the assumption
                            that they are citizens of this State, much less are they citizens of the
                            United States. The term citizen is defined by Webster in these words: In
                            the United States, a person native or naturalized, who has the privilege
                            of exercising the elective franchise, or the qualifications which enable
                            him to vote for rulers, and to purchase and hold real estate.</p>
                        <p>The supposed necessity for the passage of the resolution, I presume, is
                            that if slavery is not abolished, it will be by the ratification of the
                            proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, by
                            three-fourths of the States; incase the constitutional amendment is so
                            ratified and the status of the negro shall be defined and settled by
                            Congress, in that event the negroes would become citizens under such
                            disabilities as the States respectively might by law impose. It will be
                            time enough, for us strike from our Constitution the 13th article, after
                            the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing
                            Slavery shall have been ratified by three-fourths of the States; at any
                            rate, sufficient unto the day - in my judgment - is the evil
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion permit me to say that Indiana is, and always has been, a
                            loyal State in the Union. The reconstruction policy of the Federal
                            Executive, does not in any manner require immediate legislation on our
                            part in this matter. The question of the reconstruction of the
                            governments of the States lately in rebellion, the pacification of the
                            people thereof, will, for a considerable time, agitate the public mind
                            in both sections, and will, for some time, occupy the attention of
                            Congress. The scourge of civil war has to some extent impeded the
                            advancement of the material elements that are essential to the growth
                            and <pb n="96" xml:id="VAA8558-08-096"/>prosperity of the State. Indiana
                            has, during all this time, enjoyed a degree of prosperity equal to that
                            of any odier State in the Union. The minority of the Committee in their
                            report, state that the passage of the joint resolution under
                            consideration is inexpedient. How are the circumstances different now as
                            regards the 'negro, from what they were at the adoption of the
                            Constitution, and what has occurred that makes the proposed change
                            necessary or desirable by the people ? I, sir, recognize the fact that
                            slavery has been virtually destroyed and abolished by the war, and I,
                            for one, would not aid in restoring it, if such a thing were possible.
                            Yet we have, during the present session, been told by high authority in
                            this Hall, that slavery is'not yet abolished. If this be true, and
                            I am inclined to think it is, as a legal proposition, the status of the
                            negro is yet to be determined by the reconstruction policy of the
                            Executive and by Congress.</p>

                        <p>Amend the title by inserting after the word "pensions,"
                            "Receiving and delivering certificates of back pay, bounty, half
                            pay, pensions and pension money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Henricks in the Chair,) said: he would attempt to
                            indicate what was meant to be accomplished by this bill. It had resulted
                            from a conference of many gentlemen who had been actively connected with
                            the official service of the State. In contemplation of what is still
                            wanted of public benificence to the soldier, it had been proposed that a
                            bill should be brought in furnishing simpler means of making payment of
                            what is due to them from the Government. By the provisions of the bill
                            those applications have their beginnings through the Circuit Clerks;
                            they are then transmitted to Washington, and when allowance is made,
                            whether for half pay, back pay, bounty or pension, the returns of the
                            certificates must go to the soldier's own home. It proposed to make
                            each of the clerks of the Circuit Court an officer for these purposes.
                            The prepared papers are transmitted, not directly into the Department at
                            Washington, but to the State Agent there, who will gain time to the
                            agent in case there be any inaccuracy in the application. This was what
                            was proposed by the bill - a simple process. It prescribes the duties of
                            these public officers so strictly that it would seem they would not, if
                            they could, avoid their performance. Without expressing here any
                            estimate of how much might have been gained by the pessage of this bill
                            a year ago. He thought it might Ibe said to be of great advantage to our
                            returned soldiers, for he was informed that perhaps as many as thirty or
                            forty thousand applications for claims for back pay, bounty, pensions,
                            and pension money, will arise in the State in the course of the present
                            year; and he did not hesitate to say that .he cost to this large number
                            of claimants will be about ten dollars apiece, which runs up the immense
                            total of three hundred or four hundred thousand dollars loss diminished
                            from the beneficence of the Government toward our soldiers; and in as
                            many as four instances out of five, the persons from whose allowance
                            these sums are taken, are the least able to afford the loss of any
                            considerable amount of money. It was proposed to institute this system
                            to exhibit a proper sense of gratitude to our brave, suffering soldiers
                            on the part of the State, and at the same time add but little to the
                            burdens, of the State.</p>
                        <p>This work was to be done by existing public officers. There was now an
                            agent of State paid <pb n="97" xml:id="VAA8558-08-097"/> out of the
                            military fund at Washington. This bill proposes another agent at
                            Washington, - and there will be an oath for fidelity - so that the
                            expense to the State will hardly be enlarged, and will save to the
                            soldiers and their families no inconsiderable amounts. The pledges of
                            the State to the soldier would hardly be redeemed as they ought to be.
                            if we allow any considerable diminution of their pay in the process of
                            collecting. The fee to the Clerk is $2,00, - in no case (when there is
                            additional labor) - shall it exceed $3.00. He would have been better
                            pleased with a bill admitting of no expense to the applicant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL thought the bill unnecessary if not impracticable. First, it
                            proposes to make claim agents of the county clerks, arid they would have
                            to take out license. It was also a proposition to make an attorney of a
                            county officer. This was impracticable, because the great majoruV of
                            claimants would still make their applications through an attorney who
                            has been made a claim agent. And as to facility, the applications were
                            attended to in their turn in the Pension Bureau: and notices of
                            imperfections in the forms could be transmitted with the same facility
                            to the attorney as to the clerk. There would be nothing gained in time
                            by the appointment of a State agent, or agents, at an expense of $
                            1,800, and $2,500. This bill would also devolve dxpense upon the
                            counties. It would be a fine thing for' the State Printer,
                            supplying blanks; and it would be a fine thing for some young man
                            aspiring to the position of State agent. He recited two failures of
                            applications which he had made through the Military State agent.
                            Soldiers and their widows will not make their applications through the
                            State agent, but they will apply through their attorneys at home, in
                            whom they have confidence, and upon whom they can have recourse in case
                            of fraud or default. There might have been a necessity for these
                            agencies during the war, but now since the war has closed, there was no
                            juet pretext for them whatever.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER, The original bill provides an agency at Washington at
                            $2,500, with office rent, clerk hire, etc. The amended bill provides
                            agents both at Washington and Indianapolis, with rent and clerks - the
                            cost of the two offices would be '$4,300 a year - the clerks agd
                            perquisites would amount to $20,000 or $30,000 annually. He objected to
                            this Provost Marshal system, unless it were extended to every
                            Congressional District. He recited the lawful' manner of doing this
                            business b means of claim agents duly commissioned submitted other
                            objections to the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS objected to the fifth section of the bill, and generally to
                            the extent and expensiveness of its machinery. He would have a bill for
                            the benefit of claimants, not for the benefit of attorneys. He could not
                            vote for the bill as it now stands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE said he wanted to see the bill pass. He had been some time in
                            the business, of collecting soldiers'claims; thought this bill a
                            decided improvement on the old law, and considered it necessary. In his
                            opinion, it would expedite the collection of claims. He said
                            irresponsible men all over the State were engaged in collecting claims
                            who would in many cases abscond with the money. He cited the fact that
                            he brought to this city an order on one of these agents for $250 for one
                            of his friends, and on going to his office, he found said agent had
                            left, carrying away with him a large amount of money thus collected. He
                            regretted that all these objections to the bill came from lawyers. But
                            we should not forget the soldier in a selfish desire to promote our own
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER should have voted for the bill at the time it was introduced;
                            but the war having closed, and the soldiers returned and under the
                            influence of their friends, in far the greater number of cases,
                            applications would be made through regular agents. If the objections
                            came from lawyers, the advocates of the bill were lawyers also. He
                            instanced the small attention that is paid to the Sanitary Commission
                            agency, to show the impracticability of the bill. Would it save anything
                            to the soldiers? The system was to be supported by taxation, and taxes
                            were paid by soldiers as well as others. Again, there was not one clerk
                            out of a dozen that would be qualified to make out the papers, and not
                            one in a dozen would be entrusted with an application. He would vote for
                            a bill requiring attorneys to make out claimants' papers without
                            charge. He also summed up the expense at Washington at $4,000. Then
                            coming back here the blanks must be made out in Indianapolis, though he
                            supposed they could be obtained without charge, of the Government at
                            Washington. The different orders of blanks would cost a vast amount -
                            separate forms to each of the 95 clerks of the several counties. He
                            would do anything for the soldier. The debt to the soldiers could never
                            be overpaid. But he opposed the bill, because he thought that instead of
                            benefitting the soldiers it would benefit the officials in those
                            bureaus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH. Much that remains to be done in this claims business was on
                            account of irregularity in the papers. He favored the bill, because of
                            these irregularities it was necessary to have somebody here at
                            Indianapolis where the records are. There was also a necessity for an
                            agent at Washington to facilitate applications. So that, perhaps, the
                            delay of years might be prevented. He saw no more difficulty in a clerk
                            qualifying himself for this business, than for three or four lawyers to
                            do the same thing. He was not certain but the State could get all their
                            blanks for the benefit of the soldier free of charge, at the department
                            at Washington. So that objection was disposed of. He showed how the bill
                            would save expense to the soldier. He controverted Mr. Burwell's
                            allegation that the county clerk, under this bill, would have to take
                            out a license and pay $10 for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER sustained it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH stated other cases of delay likely to occur where this
                            business is done by attorneys. Then it was necessary that this bill
                            should be passed in order that the claims in the hands of the Sanitary
                            Commission might be completed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY objected to the bill on the score of economy. He was opposed
                            to any measure that would increase the number of State officers</p>
                        <p>Mr. LISTON was opposed to the bill - thinking that it was expensive,
                            without corresponding benefit. Claim agencies in Indiana were played
                            out. It were better for each claimant to <pb n="98" xml:id="VAA8558-08-098"/> pay $10 to his lawyer, than for the State
                            to go to the expense of the machinery of this bill. It would not
                            facilitate the progress of claims. That could be done only by increasing
                            the clerical force in the proper Departments at Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT said his experience was, that State Agents' acts were far
                            more readily attended to than a mere letter from an agent at home. It
                            was but justice to the maimed soldiers, that this bill should pass. It
                            might cost something, but we at home, and the soldier who has returned
                            safe, would not grudge the pittance that will relieve the applicant for
                            back pay. He would as soon trust the State Agent at Washington or at
                            Indianapolis as his own county lawyer. He supposed they would be friends
                            and lovers of the soldiers, and lovers of the cause in which the
                            soldiers have been engaged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN had held throughout, that the men engaged in the war should be
                            supported without respect to the political leaders that brought on the
                            collision and conducted it afterwards. It was a grave public duty. He
                            would give freely in this direction; and the question was, is this bill
                            for the benefit of the soldier? He took the view of the gentleman from
                            Jefferson (Mr. Listen.) The claim business was played out. What remains
                            of this business is what relates to pensions; and he showed that no
                            lawyer need be employed to do this. Any soldier had sense enough to draw
                            his own pension money. He recited the routine of applications for claims
                            in Washington: and that the the time necessarily expended in the Indiana
                            agency at Washington would be so much clear lost time for the applicant.
                            He saw no use for an additional State agent at the capitol of the State,
                            - the business being now as well done by the Adjutant General. He
                            recognized his duty to curtail public expenses; but if it were of
                            advantage to these claimants, he would not oppose the bill on account of
                            its cost. So far as the legal profession is concerned, he cared nothing
                            about that in connection with this claims business. It was no part of
                            the business of the profession to wait on claims.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE. The object of the bill was for the benefit of the soldier -
                            will it accomplish the purpose? He showed that it might do the applicant
                            positive harm. It would throw back the business which is now detained in
                            the Department an account of informalities. It required a high order of
                            legal talent in this business. It was a great wrong to throw the
                            soldiers upon the clerks of the counties for the adjustment of their
                            unfinished business in so many cases as where the clerk has been opposed
                            to the war, and where he is incompetent. It was also throwing a burden
                            on the County Clerks without adequate compensation, it would work
                            injustice to the clerks as well as to the soldiers. He would allow these
                            claimants to go to those in whom they have confidence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLEASON referred to the fact that there were many intricate claims
                            coming forward, requiring a high order of legal talent. If so, was not
                            that an argument calling for the aid of the State in the matter of
                            expense? He thought it was a mistake that there was little or nothing
                            remaining of this claims business. There were many inaccuracies
                            requiring investigation of the record. Something like this bill he
                            thought was necessary, and should be passed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH. As to the legal acumen necessary in this business, the
                            information was in the hands of the agents at Indianapolis and
                            Washington, These can communicate with the clerks as well as the lawyers
                            and agents at home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH made an ineffectual motion for an evening session -
                            affirmative 38 negative 40.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOOVER demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (entitled to close the debate) said he was more and more
                            confirmed in his opinion of this bill. The most forcible objection was
                            urged by Mr. Humphreys, as to the machinery. There was another like to
                            it mentioned by Mr. Miller and Mr. Brown, that the bill was too late.
                            Why, sir, we have eighteen regiments still in the service of the United
                            States. Then there were 83,000 of the hospital wrecks and their heirs,
                            and the heirs of many that have fallen by the hand of guerrillas. He
                            submitted, also, that ten per cent. of the the claims already presented
                            had been abandoned on account of the incompetency of agents. It was true
                            that the straight claims business had been disposed of. His bill took
                            hold of the worst wrecks of the war - the prisoners of Andersonville -
                            stripped of everything. This business ought to be entrusted to those who
                            are able to see that the rights of these men are respected. The bill
                            would save to the soldier twenty-five per cent. of his thirteen dollars
                            per month, which he would pay to his attorney, for doing simply that
                            which the Government does for the soldier. He gave particulars of the
                            intricacies of obtaining matter essential to establish a claim. In reply
                            to Mr. Litson, he stated that it was a rule at Washington, that
                            individual claim agents should be excluded from the records. It was not
                            so as to a State Agent. He stated this upon the information of a
                            gentleman familiar with these things at Washington. The State Agent
                            would not be acting as a lawyer, simply to promote the interests of
                            claimants, but to aid the Government to do what is right; and so, it was
                            his information, that claims would be realized in three or four weeks.
                            It was an important purpose of the bill to keep proper persons here and
                            at Washington beside the military records to furnish the necessary
                            information to complete the papers for claims. Then there was the
                            advantage of having an officer of character over that of an
                            irresponsible clerk. The bill comes in fulfillment of the pledges which
                            we gave to our men when we called upon them to enlist.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL asked whether the machinery for information in the Adjutant
                            General's Office would be continued after the passage of this
                            bill?</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. There being nothing more for him to do, the Adjutant General
                            would of course discharge his clerk. It were better not to expend so
                            much of the military fund, but name the officers ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. To whom were these Sanitary Agents responsible? When does
                            their term expire?</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. The functions of the Sanitary Commission will expire on the
                            first of <pb n="99" xml:id="VAA8558-08-099"/>January; and he thought the
                            whole people of the State ought to rise up in acknowledgement of the
                            valuable service it had performed. When he had concluded he renewed the
                            demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The demand was seconded, and the main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then again ordered to engrossement and third reading, and
                            read the third time.</p>
                        <p>The bill failed for want of a constitutional majority - yeas 47, nays 34

                        <p>Mr. NILES since this bill has passed the second reading had remarked to

                            are at present. The tendency of an increase of fees would be to increase
                            the class of professional jurors, of which every lawyer has a
                            horror.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Cullen in the Chair) opposed the amendment. We ought to
                            have the best of men for jurors. He, too, had a horror of professional
                            jurors, but if Judges of Courts were to instruct the Sheriffs, as Judge
                            Eckles does, not to summon any man who he has reason to suspect comes
                            for the purpose of getting on a jury, and to report the name of any man
                            who solicits a place upon a jury, it would cut short that class of
                            persons.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House the memorial of J. A. Craft in behalf
                            of the Grand Camps of the Host of Temperance, with an accompanying bill
                            for the suppression of tippling houses, praying for its consideration
                            and passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY moved that the memorial and bill be referred to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>, and that two hundred
                            copies of the bill be printed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH could not readily understand why there should be an order to
                            print this draft of a bill by the Host of Temperance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. There was perhaps 110 question on which the public mind is so
                            much excited at the present time, as temperance. It was indicated in
                            memorials and importunities from all parts of the State. And when we
                            regard the immense number represented in these memorials, and the moral
                            interests involved we should accord to these men - in whom he had
                            implicit confidence - thatreespect which is truly their due, as to a
                            large and highly re, spectable organization. They were tax payers as
                            well as we, and they wish every member to see their plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL presumed this mighty host is a very respectable body, and
                            they may have prepared a very good bill, but he was opposed to printing
                            it with out knowing anything about it. It was not objectionable that
                            this host, or any other host, should present a bill, but the printing
                            was unusual and ought not to be expected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE also thought it best first to know what the bill contained. He
                            moved to lay the motion to print on the table.It was so ordered, and
                            then the memorial was referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                                Temperance</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE presented a petition from sundry citizens of Putnam county for
                            amendment of the liquor law, which was referred to the

                            county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB presented a similar memorial from 2,340 citizens of
                            Indianapolis on the same subject.</p>
                        <p>They were referred to the <orgName>Committee on Temperance</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STENGER presented the memorial of the Commissioners of Dearborn
                            County for the repeal of the Soldier's Relief Law, except, etc.,
                            which was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and
                            Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER presented the memorial of John Pettit and others, citizens of
                            Tippecanoe County, for the repeal of the Black Laws, and such
                            legislation as will secure to the colored people the right to testify in
                            Courts of Justice, and the benefit of common schools; which was referred
                            to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LITSON presented the memorial of sundry citizens of Jefferson County
                            for legislation admitting of swinging gates in highways in certain
                            cases; which was referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                            Roads</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT submitted 20 memorials for claims, which, without reading,
                            were referred to the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>.</p>

                            returned Mr. Gregory, of Warren's, school tax bill [H. R. 183]
                            reporting that legislation thereon is inexpedient at this time, because
                            the bill itself is objectionable; and inasmuch as the State school tax
                            has been increased about 60 per cent., any further increase would be
                            onorous and objectionable. The Committee recommended that the bill lie
                            on the table.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>

                            that legislation on that subject is inexpedient at this time, and
                            recommending indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB stated that the specific object of the bill was to provide
                            that the vote of soldiers be taken. That necessity having <pb n="103" xml:id="VAA8558-08-103"/>happily passed with the war, the Committee

                        <p>Mr. MILROY apologized for his offhand style. He insisted that the purity
                            of the ballot box should be protected by Legislation. Here we were
                            called upon to invite into our midst, as voters, a race confessedly
                            inferior, and always incapable of self-government. Our fathers had
                            disfranchised Indians and negroes on account of this. He inveiged
                            against this negro fanaticism in our politics - where fanaticism
                            obtains, justice dies. The consummation of the objects of this
                            fanaticism would lead to a war of races and the extinguishment of the
                            black race. Let it succeed - if the Republican Party dare to press it -
                            and it will damn them forever.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER next took the floor, defining his position, and reconciling
                            it on the 13th article in the Constitutional Convention of 1850, with
                            his present position on the same matter. He referred to the
                            determination of the dominant party of that day to force slavery on the
                            whole country, and for that reason he voted for this 13th article. He
                            referred to the violation of the compromise of 1850 by the Democratic
                            party, in the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and in the Lecompton
                            controversy; and then referred to the fact that those very men who
                            refused to stand by their Government in the late rebellion were refusing
                            now the just rights and legal protection of those who did stand by the
                            Government on all the bloody fields of the rebellion. On account of
                            these considerations, as well as on account of its intrinsic justice, he
                            should support this proposition to strike out the 13th article of the
                            State Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY moved that the further consideration of this special order be
                            postponed till Tuesday, butOn the amendment of Mr. LANE it was made the
                            special order for Tuesday, 7 o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK (by consent) introduced a bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_253">H. R. 253</ref>] for An Act to amend the
                            8th section of the Common Pleas act of March 5, 1859, which 8th section
                            was amended March 7. [It changes the time of said Courts in the counties
                            of Morgan, Johnson, Monroe, Shelby and Brown.]</p>
                        <p>It was referred to a select committee of three.</p>
                        <p>Leave of absence was obtained for Messrs. Howard, Abbett, Chambers and
                            Vcach till next week.</p>

                        <p>Mr. LANE called up the consideration of Mr. Shuey's bill [H. R. 218]
                            amendatory of the license liquor law the question being on the adoption
                            of Mr. Lane's amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN thought it better for the bill and its friends not to press its
                            consideration till some day next week. Those who are opposed to the bill
                            have been waiting for its completion before they submit their
                            objections. He hoped the motion to force its passage now would not
                            prevail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE. A similar bill was introduced during the last session.
                            Petitions have come in for it, and there was no subject for which the
                            people of the State were so generally asking.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART also referred to the flood of petitions on this subject, and
                            desired the bill to be taken up. It should be passed before the winter
                            meeting of the County Commissioners. He repeated his former reasoning
                            for this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY stated the condition of the bill there being two amendments
                            pending. He wished to consider the amendments. He was not willing to
                            press the bill to its passage today, but would move when in order that
                            it be postponed and made a special order for Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER suggested that the bill be printed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that it be taken up, the amendment disposed of, and
                            then that it be made a special order. There was no purpose to impede
                            legislation in this direction.</p>
                        <p>[The SPEAKER announed the following Special Committee on Mr.
                            Buskirk's bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_253">H. R. 253</ref>]
                            viz: Messrs. Buskirk, Miller and Harrison.]Mr. Lane's motion was
                            then agreed to and Mr. Shuey's bill No. 218 was taken up.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Hendricks in the Chair.) The first question is on the
                            adoption of the <pb n="106" xml:id="VAA8558-08-106"/> amendment offered
                            by the gentleman from Putnam, striking out all that relates to
                            towns.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, submitted to Mr. Lane that the object might be defeated in
                            particular cases which he gave.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE. These were isolated cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. The bill was shaped simply with respect to his own knowledge
                            and experience. He had no doubt that the saloonkeepers of his town
                            would, if they were here, work for the passage of the amendment of the
                            gentleman from Putnam. He deprecated amendments. The Committee's
                            amendment, was to supply an omission in his original draft. Its effect
                            was to leave it open to the Commissioners to inqure as they please as to
                            the number of legal voters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE was not so wedded to his amendment as to withdraw his support
                            from the best bill we can obtain, if it fails. He believed that the
                            suffrages of the country people were safer on this subject; and some
                            fifteen petitions had lately come in here asking for the precise matter
                            of his amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH said it was a fact that the bad effects of this traffic were
                            nowhere so bad as in these little villages. Certainly the people of the
                            townships surrounding these little towns were directly interested in the
                            matter of licenses. He should support this amendment and the bill life
                            would support the bill if it took never so much whisky every day to keep
                            him in his place here; because his people distinctly desired it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, should support the amendment because it would put
                            the applicant to a little more trouble.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. RHOADS, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P.
                            M.</p>

                    <div type="section">
                        <head rend="center">AFTERNOON SESSION.</head>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) stated the question to be on Mr.
                            Lane's amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was adopted: also the amendment of the <orgName>Committee on
                                Temperance</orgName>, without a division.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS proposed to amend farther: in section 4, line 8, after the
                            word "required," insert this: "and that the said petition
                            contains the signatures of a majority of the legal voters in such
                            township, city or ward." The object was to throw the proof on the
                            applicant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said it was mere verbiage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE would prefer prohibition; but suggested that for this bill it
                            would be better to throw the proof upon the temperance people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS read from an article in this morning's <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> to show that the enemies of this legislation and the
                            gentleman from Park had fallen into the same line of argument. He wished
                            to place this provison of the bill beyond doubt. He would be glad, if
                            this bill pass, that what the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi> article predicts
                            shall be realized in ten months, viz: the withdrawal of all the saloon
                            keepers from the cities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. The Commissioners, after all, will determine for themselves
                            what satisfies their mind. The declaration that this was to be in effect
                            a prohibitory law, was the strongest argument he had against it. He
                            would just as soon repeal all laws on the subject, as to pass a
                            prohibitory law.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. HIGGINS, the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill till
                            Tuesday, 2 o'clock P.M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER moved to amend by adding an order to print 200 copies.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN hoped it would be postponed to a later day. As a friend of
                            Temperance, he doubted the propriety of the passage of the bill at
                            all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL also advised delay, for want of information as to the details
                            of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY then proposed to postpone till Wednesday, 2 o'clock, P.
                            M.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Stringer, Riford and others, obtained leave of absence till

                        <p>The bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_043">H. R. 43</ref>, to repeal the
                            Act to establish Courts of Conciliation, etc., approved January 11,
                            1852, was read the third time.</p>
                        <pb n="111" xml:id="VAA8558-08-111"/>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN said that the law establishing this Court is a dead letter on
                            the statute book, and for this reason he hoped the bill would pass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING, [Mr. Bennett in the Chair] as a practicing Attorney, was in
                            favor of the repeal of the Act; and had heard Judges of Common Pleas
                            Courts express themselves in favor of the abolishment of this Court of
                            Conciliation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, entered his protest against the passage of this
                            bill. He regarded this Court as one established upon sound principles,
                            and as one that has done good in his part of the State. A Common Pleas
                            Judge of eight years experience there, declares that in six cases out of
                            ten a compromise is effected by the operations of this Court. It has for
                            its object the discouragement of litigation, and thereby preserves, to a
                            great extent, the peace of communities. The reason why the law is a dead
                            letter is simply because Attorneys in some localities agree to disregard
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. This Act has been enforced for eight or ten years, and he had
                            yet to see the good it has done. He knew of instances where it had
                            produced evil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT stated that this same bill was voted down in 1863, after
                            getting to the same stage this one now occupies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG stated principles that convinced him this bill should be
                            passed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, replied to objections urged against the Court of
                            Conciliation, and contended that it was much better for the ends of
                            justice to continue it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS insisted that bad counsel was the reason, in nineteen cases
                            out of twenty, why this Court was not of advantage to litigants. He had
                            heard no reasons satisfactory to him whv it should be abolished.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GIFFORD heretofore had opposed this measure, but since the last
                            session, had formed a more intimate acquaintance with the workings of
                            the Court of Conciliation, and would now vote for the passage of this
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON denied the intimation that the passage of this bill would
                            benefit the legal profession.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB thought the law in regard to Courts of Conciliation was a great
                            humbug. He had never known of a case amicably adjusted by this court;
                            and submitted that there was no good reason for continuing the law
                            longer on our statute books.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, as the people have not petitioned for the repeal of this
                            bill, did not feel justified in voting to disturb a law that has stood
                            so long on the statute book.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON hoped the bill would not pass. This Court of Conciliation is
                            one where parties may enter without engendering bad blood, and he hoped
                            the Senate would let it stand at least one year longer.</p>
                        <p>The bill then passed the Senate by yeas 28, nays 14, as follows:</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER announced the order of the consideration of bills of the

                        <p>Mr. Humphreys' real estate sale notice bill [H. R. No. 87,] coming
                            up with a favorable report from the committee, it was ordered to be
                            engrossed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rhoads' School Commissioner bill [H. R. 235,] coming up with a
                            favorable recommendation from the <orgName>Committee on
                                Education</orgName></p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, explained that the object of the bill was to dig
                            out moneys lost in the various county treasuries. It was recommended by
                            the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who had already ferretted out
                            some $27,000 of the school fund sequestered; in the treasuries of only
                            two or three counties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK advised delay about authorizing this Commissioner at a salary
                            of $3,500 more than the Superintendent of Instruction receives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS made the statement submitted by Mr. Gregory as to the amoant
                            of school money which had been discovered by the Superintendent of
                            Public Instruction as unaccounted for in Wayne county. The
                            Superintendent could not continue to do this work and he showed the
                            necessity of this Commissioner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB thought it best to pay the expenses of this Commissioner
                            separate from the salary. He spoke of the loose manner in which these
                            school funds are managed, and recommended a change of custodians, and
                            deposit where it would be secure from loss. We have a law now that the
                            counties shall he responsible for the fund. The bill would not cure the
                            evil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL also objected to the creation of this new office. The
                            Superintendent should perform its duties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. It would require more than one day to each county
                            seat. This bill was to make a final settlement of these sequestered
                            funds. It would add seventy or eighty thousand dollars to the school
                            fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY. Former Superintendents had labored in this direction as well
                            as the present Superintendent, and the work was partly done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. The school system was getting to be too expensive in its
                            machinery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend, by striking out of section three
                            "3,500," and inserting in lieu this: "$2,000 and his
                            natural and necessary traveling expenses;" and inserting further:
                            "from the fund raised by taxation for school purposes."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL moved indefinite postponement of the bill and pending
                            amendments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS advised delay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER thought the bill would not benefit the children. There was the
                            expense of hunting up this money. It would be better at once to assess
                            the needful tax directly. The bill was simply making an officer to see
                            whether the County Auditors have done their duty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS made a statement to show that the Commissioner could not go
                            into the 93 counties and investigate this fund in one year. But he saw
                            no necessity for the bill, and demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The previous question was seconded, and the main question, and the yeas
                            and nays were ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK made an ineffectual motion to lay the subject on the table
                            affirmative 26, negative 57.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Burwell's motion to postpone was then agreed to by yeas 72, nays
                            11.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVey's legalizing-appraisements bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_212">H. R. 212</ref>] coming up with a
                            favorable recommendation from the Committee, it was passed to the second
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained, that appraisements shall not be invalid, because
                            of the failure of appraisers to give notice, etc., and on his motion,
                            the constitutional restriction was suspended - yeas 68, nays 9 - and it

                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was amended by striking out the emergency
                            clause. He was opposed to the hasty passage of bills with penalties.</p>
                        <p>And then it was ordered to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>The bill [S. 141] amending secs. 5 and 6 of the act concerning voluntary

                        <p>The bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_084">S. 84</ref>] ameding the 4th
                            section of the Justices Act, so that in State prosecutions his warrant
                            may be served in any part of the State, coming up on the third reading - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained its provisions, that where the clerk certifies that
                            the person issuing the writ is an acting justice of the peace, the
                            warrant may be served in any part of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE and Mr. COLLINS objected, and thought the bill would be
                            inoperative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL and Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, thought it a good bill, giving
                            examples of its applicability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE desired to amend.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Lasselle in the Chair) said the gentlemen could move to
                            refer the bill with instructions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE then moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName>, with instructions to amend so that it shall
                            apply only to felony cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN opposed; the bill was specially intended to reach cases of
                            misdemeanors. He gave examples.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB (in his seat.) It applies to both felony and misdemeanor
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said there was a very pressing necessity for this bill in his
                            region.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE withdrew his motion.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed the final reading in the House of Representatives -

                            up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained that the provision of law sought here, was, that a
                            man may be confined in an adjoining county jail, where the jail of his
                            own county is not sufficient to hold him.</p>

                            the erection of school houses, etc., coming up as heretofore amended</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLEASON explained. It was introduced by Judge Niles of the other
                            branch. It was more particularly applicable to the city of Laporte. That
                            city "has commenced a High School building, and the object is, that
                            the city may raise money for the payment and completion of that
                            building. It applies to cases where such buildings have been commenced,
                            and are not completed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. RICE and Mr. NEWCOMB. All the records were indexed except the order
                            books.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS reasoned against its passage.</p>

                        <p>Mr. GROVES moved that leave of absence be granted to the
                                <orgName>Committee on the State Prison South</orgName>, from
                            Thursday till Saturday morning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN resisted the motion, because the House would be without a
                            quorum, and because we have called for all the information we want in
                            that direction. He moved to lay the motion on the table, but immediately
                            withdrew it.</p>
                        <p>MR. GROVES. The <orgName>Committee on the Northern Prison</orgName> made
                            their visit at the last session. The application was made at the request
                            of the committee.</p>
                        <pb n="116" xml:id="VAA8558-08-116"/>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS was satisfied that no satisfactory report could be made
                            without a visit, especially now when there are repairs to be made in the
                            prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD admitted that he might have voted wrong the other day when he
                            voted against the visit of the Northern Prison. We could not investigate
                            either the prisoners or the officers without actual visitation. He would
                            prefer that these committees were composed of not more than three or
                            four members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN proposed to send the Chairman and two members of the Committee
                            to Jeffersonville. This was all the Committee ought to ask and all the
                            House should give now. He expected no good to result from any
                            investigation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART said a part of this Committee went down last session, and
                            perhaps all of them got paid for going.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES as Chairman, did not visit the Southern Prison last session.
                            He went, as specially appointed, with a few others, to visit the
                            Northern Prison, but had received no pay for it.</p>
                        <p>After further debate by Mr. SPENCER, Mr. COLLINS, Mr. STRINGER, and Mr.
                            PRATHER - </p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown's amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>And then, on motion by Mr. BROWN, the original motion was laid on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meredith's bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_082">H. R.

                        <p>Mr. MEREDITH explained, that the bill, though not his own, was introduced
                            by him, and was, with slight modifications, the general law of 1855 on
                            this subject.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed the final reading in the House of Representatives -

                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>, announced the consideration of
                            the special order for this hour, viz: the House amendments to the bill
                                <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_196">S. No. 196</ref> (printed in these
                            Reports of the 14th) concerning the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas
                                corpus</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, since the passage of this Bill by the Senate, upon mature
                            deliberation, had come to the conclusion that the bill should fail. He
                            knew of no State which does not give to the Supreme Judges jurisdiction
                            in cases of this kind; we have always done it heretofore, and that duty
                            should be still imposed upon them. He cited instances where the law as
                            it now is was of inestimable value to citizens who have been refused the
                            writ in their own districts; and without taking up the time of the
                            Senate in arguing the question, declared his opposition to the measure
                            from this time forward.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. These amendments ought to be concurred in. It is not a denial
                            of the writ to take the Jurisdiction away from the Supreme Court, nor is
                            it a want of confidence in that Court which induced the presentation of
                            this bill. While the time of our Judges are taken up with trials of
                            writs of habeas corpus, <pb n="117" xml:id="VAA8558-08-117"/>they cannot
                            decide other cases which may be awaiting their decision. The rights of a
                            speedy and impartial, trial are amply provided lor in this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. The right to personal liberty is perhaps the dearest one a
                            man can cherish, and while willing to lift from the Judges of the
                            Supreme Court any burden that might rest upon them, he was unwilling to
                            close any of the avenues to personal liberty. Every Court in the State
                            should be open for the purposes of application for this writ by parties
                            restrained of liberty; and there is no right or justice in the
                            proposition to close the highest Court in the State of Indiana against
                            her citizens in this respect. It were better that every single case on
                            the docket of the Supreme Court should stand still than that one
                            innocent man should be kept in jail one hour.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN. At the time this bill passed was one one of those who
                            carelessly and inconsiderately voted for it. He should now oppose
                            concurring in the House amendments and aid in every possible way to kill
                            the bill, for it ought to die. This bill proposes to curtail the
                            privileges of the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi>, which
                            heretofore has been regarded as one of the greatest privileges of an
                            American citizen. That there was no abridgement of the privileges of the
                            writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> has been the proudest boast of
                            an American citizen. No hand should be raised to strike it down, or to
                            curtail any of its privileges. What is the plea of necessity urged for
                            the curtailment of this right at the present time? Why the Supreme bench
                            want to be relieved of a little labor. That is all. If we attempt to
                            curtail these privileges by shutting up one of the avenues to obtain
                            that writ, we strike a blow that will be felt in all time to come; and,
                            it would seem that we strike a blow at the Constitution itself. But it
                            is claimed that this bill would leave the party with the right of appeal
                            to the Supreme Court. Then that Court would not be relieved of this
                            class of business; and the appeal would come up surrounded with many
                            prejudices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON envied the Senator having a higher appreciation than he of
                            the rights and privileges of writs of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi>,
                            but thought they could be guaranteed to every citizen without the
                            necessity of burdening the Supreme Court, encumbering its records, and
                            preventing its attention to its proper business. The sole object of this
                            bill is that the Supreme Judges should not be burdened by trying writs
                            of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi>. If the writ is refused by the courts
                            below, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court, and they are compelled to
                            take up the case immediately. But there would not be one case in fifty
                            where the courts below would refuse to grant an application. He knew of
                            but one case in a practice of twenty years, and then the refusal was
                            based on the idea that the Judge did not have jurisdiction. This bill
                            gives the Judges of both the Common Pleas and Circuit Courts
                            jurisdiction, so that plea can not be made after its passage. He hoped
                            the bill would pass, so that the Supreme Court may be deprived of
                            original jurisdiction in these cases. Then applications would be made to
                            the courts at home, and witnesses would not be compelled to come up to
                            i,he capital at a heavy expense, for which the law provides no
                            remuneration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that he was no special advocate of the bill, but was
                            inclined to favor it. The Supreme Court was intended solely as a court
                            of errors, and it was an anomaly in our system to require the Judges to
                            hear writs of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi>. Their opinions constitute
                            a part of the law of the State, and settle rules of property and all
                            private rights. He thought it important that their whole time be given
                            to the peculiar duties of their office. At the same time he would not,
                            in any manner, abridge the great writ of liberty. If necessary, he would
                            amend the <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> act so that in case of one
                            local judge being prejudiced, another could be called in to try the
                            case; and if, as has been intimated, any judge should dare to refuse the
                            writ, when properly applied for, he would make the penalty for such a
                            refusal tenfold greater than at present. He suggested that the <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> act could be so amended as to avoid all
                            necessity for bringing such cases, in the first instance before the
                            judges of the Supreme Court.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER was the only Senator who voted against this bill on its
                            passage, and he was now but more firmly convinced that it is wrong to
                            take from the Supreme Court its present jurisdiction in <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi> cases. There is not a Circuit or Common Pleas
                            Court in his part of the State but what is overburthened with business,
                            and he could not see the justice of still further burthening these
                            courts and relieving the Judges of the Supreme Court, who, it is said,
                            are about up with their business. The Judges of the Supreme Court
                            receive a salary of $3,000, and the Circuit Judges, who do twice the
                            business, but $2,000. For these and reasons given by the Senator from
                            Rush [Mr. Cullen,] and others, he should vote against concurrence in the
                            amendments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON'S understanding was that this bill will enlarge the
                            privileges of the writ of <hi rend="i">habeas corpus</hi>. It was
                            unquestionably better to vote for this law. The arguments presented by
                            the Senator from Laporte [Mr. Niles,] were important, and should receive
                            the attention of Senators.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON opposed concurrence in the amendments of the House, because
                            he desired to see the bill fail. A man's personal liberty is above
                            all property, and he ought to have the right to appeal to Herod or to
                            Caesar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, voted for the bill when it passed the Senate,
                            entirely through the confidence he had in the friends of the bill, and
                            not from personal knowledge of its provisions. Under circumstances since
                            disclosed, and upon the discussion of the merits of the bill this
                            morning, he was now compelled to vote against concurrence.</p>
                        <p>The Senate refused to concur in the House amendments by yeas 15, nays 29,

                            the Acting Governor, received this morning, transmitting a communication
                            from citizens of Monroe county, making a proposition to give the State
                            the geological and mineral Cabinet of the late David Dale Owen, valued
                            at $75,000, and a suitable farm worth $25,000, conditioned on the
                            location of an agricultural college at Bloomington; was taken up and

                        <p>The PRESIDENT stated the special order for this hour to be the
                            consideration of the bill S. No. 64, to provide for the registry of
                            voters, declaring their residence and punishing fraudulent voting; the
                            question being shall the bill pass?</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. If we are to have a registry law at all, this is probably the
                            best bill we can get, for it is a compilation from several that have
                            been introduced here. He hoped the bill would pass without
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER was favorable to the general features of the bill, but
                            objected to several particulars therein contained. He hoped the bill
                            would be recommitted and amended in one or two instances, which he
                            cited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER, considering these objections made in good faith, moved to
                            recommit the bill with instructions to amend, as suggested by the
                            Senator, so that the oldest acting Justice of the Peace in each township
                            and the Trustee thereof shall constitute the Board of Registry and to
                            inquire whether the Legislature has power to require a residence of ten
                            days.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, the instructions were amended so as to
                            include a provision for an appeal from the Board of Registry by any
                            person aggrieved by its decision.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was then agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN, from a select committee thereon, returned the bill, S. No.
                            66, to amend section 11 of the act fixing the times of holding the
                            Common Pleas Courts, etc., recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER understood that this bill proposed to create a new Common Pleas
                            District. He was opposed to this increased expense, and moved its
                            reference to the <orgName>Committee on Organization of Courts of
                                Justice</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN opposed the motion to refer, and insisted on the passage of
                            the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK said the people of the counties interested asked for the
                            passage of the bill, and thereupon - </p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER withdrew his objections.</p>
                        <p>The report of the committee'was then concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                            bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_215">S. No. 215</ref>, to amend
                            section 27 of the General Practice Act, approved June 18, 1852,
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES explained that the bill provided fpr calling in another Judge
                            to try causes in which the Judge is found to be interestedso amending
                            the present law that a Judge of the Circuit or Common Pias Court may be
                            called in.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in, ind the bill read a second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON made an ineffectual motion to amend the bill by striking out
                            that part of it which allows the calling in of the Common Pleas
                            Judge.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOWMAN, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>,
                            returned the bill S. No. 246, to repeal section 17 of the act
                            incorporating the Fireman's and Mechanics Insurance Company,
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in and the bill read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                            bill S. No. 212 to amend section 23 of An Act incorporating insurance
                            Companies, approved June 17, 1862; recommending its passage with an
                            amendment repealing section 22 of the same Act.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER realized the necessity of a penalty in case an Insurance
                            Company failed to fulfill its contract; and consequently opposed the
                            amendment which proposes to 'strike out this section 22. While
                            conceding that the penalty in the section proposed to be stricken out,
                            is excessive, he would not leave the law without any penalty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN also opposed the amendment. Parties insuring knew but little
                            about the responsibilities of Companies. He regarded this section as
                            important in protecting the citizen against imposition by these
                            corporations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, to prevent further trouble, withdrew <pb n="119" xml:id="VAA8558-08-119"/>that part of his Committee report proposing
                            to repeal the twenty-second section.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Committee, recommending simply the passage of the bill,
                            was then concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>,
                            returned the bill S. 213 to amend section 33 of an Act repealing all
                            general laws in force for the incorporation of cities, etc., approved
                            March 9, 1857, with a report that in the opinion of the Committee,
                            further legislation thereon is unnecessary.</p>
                        <p> The report was concurred in, and the bill laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG, from the thereon, returned the bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_227">227</ref> for the relief of the
                            Treasurer of Clinton county, recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON was satisfied that the bill before the Senate last winter -
                            the case of Mr. Williams, of Brown county - is similar to the case
                            presented in the bill before the Senate; and he was satisfied that the
                            principle involved in this species of legislation has as much to do with
                            the future of Indiana as any one feature of legislation. He moved to
                            refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>:</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON was personally acquainted withthe Treasurer of Clinton county
                            [Mr. Armstrong] and knew him to be an upright gentleman and a man of the
                            strictest integrity. He could not see the necessity of referring this
                            matter to the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN could see no great principle involved in this bill; and spoke
                            in favor of its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN having been a member of this Special Committee, recited the
                            particulars of the case as brought out by the investigation; and urged
                            the passage of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON. The revenues of the State are collected by a set of men
                            unknown to the State - elected by the several counties, and who are in
                            no shape or form responsible to the State. Let this Legislature
                            establish the precedent of relieving officers in such cases, and the
                            principle he referred to is that it would open the door to fraud all
                            over the State. And if this claim were allowed, what assurance have we
                            that in less than live years there would not come up here similar claims
                            to the amount of perhaps half a million? And then the principle of
                            refunding money on <hi rend="i">ex parte</hi> testimony is a precedent
                            which should be shunned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG argued that County Treasurers were the agents of the State to
                            a certain extent, and insisted the passage of the bill would be but a
                            simple act of justice. He concluded by hoping the bill would not be
                            recommitted, but that the report would be concurred in and the bill
                            passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS objected to making the State of Indiana an insurance company
                            against burglaries. He read from a decision of the Supreme Court, in the
                            case of Halbert vs. the State, in the County of Martin, as applicable to
                            this case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER thought if there ever was a meritorious case of this class,
                            this certainly was one.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected, and the bill was ordered to the
                            third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                                Business</orgName>, returned the bill S. No. 161, requiring Boards
                            of County Commissioners to examine the papers of any county officer who
                            may be charged with receiving a greater amount of fees than he is by law
                            entitled to receive, recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in and the bill read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER, from the Special Committee thereon, returned the bill S. No.
                            214, defining what officers shall be elected by each House of the
                            General Assembly, recommending its passage with an amendment, inserting
                            new matter after the enacting clause. [Providing for but one Clerk and
                            Doorkeeper for each House The Secretary of the Senate to receive for a

                            session $1,200.]</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to and the bill passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, returned
                            the bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_084">H. R. 84</ref> to legalize,

                            appraisement shall be made; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in and the bill passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>,
                            returned'the bill S. 203 to authorize suits to be instituted and

                        <p>On motion of Mr. SHUEY, the House took up the Special Order, viz: the
                            consideration of Mr. S.'s bill [H. R. 218] to amend sections 3 and
                            4 of the license act of March 5, 1859, and prescribing penalty in case
                            of a second or subsequent conviction; the question being on the third
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved to refer the bill to a select committee of five, with
                            instructions to strike out all after the enacting clause, and insert a
                            substitute with provisions to the following effect:</p>

                            <item n="2">It amends section 4 of the act of 1859, so that

                                his conviction.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB urged his motion because he thought the bill had not been
                            long enough printed to have received adequate attention. The original
                            bill was in effect a prohibitory law - so declared by its friends on the
                            floor. He had given thought to this subject. He had voted for the
                            prohibatory law ten years ago. He had been lately in the State of Maine
                            - the State of the original Maine Liquor Law where that statute is still
                            in force; but he saw there bars in the hotels and drinking shops in the
                            cities as abundant and unrestricted as here in Indianapolis. This bill
                            might have a good effect in the rural districts, he did not think this
                            or any legislation would suppress drinking in the cities; but he thought
                            his substitute would do better. We had not in our legislation
                            distinguished between fermented and distilled liquors. He believed in
                            the Henry Ward Beeeher doctrine, that we had better encourage breweries
                            and discourage distilleries. He then recited the provisions of his
                            substitute. He would reduce the number of drinking shops; by the large
                            amount of license which he prescribed for retailers of the second class.
                            The license and the fee would amount to about $300 a year. He admitted
                            that the passage of the original bill would do good in the country; but
                            it would array every saloon man against the law. If we permit the sale
                            of these lighter drinks, we do something to wean people from stronger
                            drinks. His substitute amended some four or five sections of the
                            existing law: the original bill proposes to amend but two sections. He
                            referred particularly to the provision against the drinking by
                            "whiskered minors."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN saw no propriety in the substitute. If the traffic was an evil,
                            he would face it at once. If not, let us lay these bills aside and take
                            up other business. As a friend of the cause of temperance, he believed
                            that the trafficker in undistilled liquors was the greater offender. For
                            the old offender in intemperance was beyond the reach of reformation.
                            The first class of dealers in the substitute would but educate the youth
                            of the land to become consummate and irretrievable drunkards. Therefore,
                            if gentlemen desire to be effectual in this thing, come up and stop tho
                            traffic forevernot hold out an invitation to begin the downward career.
                            He should support the bill of the gentlemen from Elkhart rather than
                            that of the gentlemen from Marion. <pb n="121" xml:id="VAA8558-08-121"/>
                            On account of the considerations taken. It was more consistent with the
                            professions of temperance men.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE. Was the gentleman from Jackson in favor of the bill of the
                            gentleman from Elkhart?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. As between the two, he was decidedly in favor of that of the
                            gentleman from Elkhart. But his honest conviction was, that even the
                            original bill would contribute no good to the cause of Temperance: he
                            believed also, that it would not stand before the courts: and that was
                            the principal reason for his opposition. He would not deny his vote or
                            his voice to any measure that would promote the cause of Temperance. But
                            if he should be mistaken in his estimate of the bill, he hoped it would
                            pass, and be enforced and supported by the people of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren liked the law of 1859. He would patch that law up,
                            since gentlemen were so timorous - so much afraid of positive acts here,
                            lie was opposed to the substitute - to its classification of
                            traffickers. It was objected to the original bill, that it was
                            prohibitory, but the substitute was the most prohibitory of the two. He
                            preferred the slighter amendments of the law of 1859. Petitions signed
                            by thousands and tens of thousands were constantly coming in here for
                            the passage of this very bill. He himself had no ulterior designs in
                            connection with this question. His measure of credit or discredit had
                            been filled up in this House. He cared only for the public good. He
                            would have the House act like men with consciences and clear heads.
                            [Cheers in the lobbies - repressed by the Speaker as an infraction of
                            the Rules of the House.] He would say, support the right and repress the
                            wrong. He would amend the law of 1859 by adding stringency in regard to
                            selling on the Sabbath, and selling to minors, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE came from a constituency of temperance men. One class of
                            petitions from his county asked for the provisions of the Shuey bill. He
                            might disagree with some of his constituents on this question. He was a
                            friend of the Temperance cause. It was the duty of the legislature to
                            throw restrictions around the allurements to drink. He would not support
                            the original bill, because, whilst it recommended the principle of
                            license it was in fact a prohibitory bill. Prohibition would not remove
                            the evil, if it were not supported by the public sentiment. He instanced
                            the negro-exclusion laws of this State. The liquor law, as it stands,
                            was better than the bill of Mr. Shuey. He recited that provision of the
                            substitute which distinguishes in favor of fermented malt liquors: who
                            could point to greatly injurious intoxications amongst the beer-drinking
                            Germans? He would curb beer selling by a license, and enclose it within
                            the folds of the law. Then he would reduce the number of drain-shops by
                            a heavier tax. He would encourage the drinking of beers and native wines
                            and discourage and cut down the number of drinking places of the more
                            dangerous class. He also recited the several provisions of the
                            substitute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT defined his position on the subject of temperance - a subject
                            which seems now prominent in the minds of the people. From perhaps every
                            county in the State except his own, temperance petitions had been sent
                            in here; and neither his county nor himself were wanting in friendliness
                            to the cause of temperance. His experience in the army convinced him
                            that no prohibition would prevent either drinking or the traffic in
                            drinks, he would vote for the most stringent law that would be
                            effectual. He had no fear of the political influence of the liquor
                            dealers. That was tried at the last general election. He would have
                            reformation in temperance to begin in the household, as suggested by Mr.
                            Rice. But, as between the substitute and the Original bill, he preferred
                            the former. He professed conservatism on this question, and would vote
                            for the best bill we could get.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY, ascribed the authorship of this bill, not to himself, but to
                            the enlightened pubic judgment of the State. He described wherein the
                            bill proposed to amend the existing act of 1859. The people had found in
                            it ao protection from the encroachments of Intemperance, and they had
                            bowed to it as long is they could. Hence the bill simply makes his
                            provision: that any person desirous of license, shall procure a majority
                            of the legal voters of his ward or township to sign his petition, and
                            file it in the County Auditor's office six days before the meeting
                            of the Board of County Commissioners where his application is made. He
                            declared that it was not intended to be a prohibitory law; though it
                            might so operate in some parts of the State. He replied to Mr.
                            Newcomb's allegations against the efficiency of the Neal Dow Maine
                            Liquor Law. It was a good indication, that the people of the State of
                            Maine had not repealed it yet: and that law - a copy of it - was now in
                            force in the State of Iowa, and effective in the suppression of the
                            traffic. He was not for the Beecher doctrine alleged by Mr. Newcomb: -
                            Encourage beer, and discourge whisky: but he would do right. He replied
                            generally to the objections urged against the bill. He desired to come
                            to the vote on all these questions; and hoped all amendments would be
                            voted down, so that the House might establish the principle that a
                            majority of the people shall govern license.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay the substitute on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Newcomb demanded the yeas and nays, which being ordered and taken,
                            resulted - yeas 53, nays 34 - as follows.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS proposed to recommit the bill, with instructions to amend in
                            section 3, line 9 - striking out "one-half," and inserting
                            " one-fourth" instead; striking out "majority " and

                        <p>Mr. LANE moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to - yeas 51, nays 85.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LITSON moved to recommit the bill with instructions, viz: Strike out
                            all that part which requires a majority of the legal Voters to sign the
                            petition, and insert in lieu a clause to this effect; where a majority
                            shall protest, no license shall be granted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to - yeas, 48; nays, 37.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH now demanded the previous question, but there was not a
                            second - affirmative, 43; negative, 48.</p>
                        <p>Mr, ZEIGLER made an ineffectual motion to adjourn - affirmative, 28;
                            negative, 59.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS, as there is a special order (the nigger question) for
                            to-night, he moved that when the House adjourn, it shall be till 7

                        <p>It was rejected.Mr. BURWELL moved that the further consideration of the

                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT proposed to postpone till tomorrow night.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN made an ineffectual motion to lay these motions on the

                        <p>An then, on motion by Mr. COFFROTH, the House (at 4:35) adjourned.</p>

                            lotion of the school, was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The committee amendment in section 8, substituting "$5,000" for

                            completion of the building, being read, objection was made thereto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON made an appeal to Senators in favor of the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN would not throw anything in the way of such an enterprise, but
                            the districts of country bidding for the location of this school could
                            just as well bid $45,000 as $40,000, and save to the State this $5,000
                            proposed to be drawn from the treasury. Our taxes are now sufficiently
                            heavy, and we ought to save every dollar we can to the State
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT feared the precedent would be a bad one. He did not oppose the
                            amendment out of hostility to the Normal School, or any thing of that
                            kind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON was willing to build up a normal school if it took every dollar
                            out of the State Treasury, for it is the foundation of our school
                            system;if we do not have competent teachers we cannot have good schools.
                            How do gentlemen expect to cany on a school system without money? This
                            is the most beneficent purpose for which the State can spend her
                            money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT expressed himself in favor of the amendment, and willing to
                            vote any amount needed for the encouragement of such enterprises.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER, as a friend to education and of a normal school in the State
                            of Indiana, thought with ihe Senator from Rush [Mr. Cullen] that we can
                            get sufficient competition from various localities in the State to put
                            the institution on a substantial foundation. And We certainly should
                            guard carefully, for some time to come, all approaches to the State
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to reconsider the vote adopting the Committee amendment
                            striking out "$50,000 " and inserting in lieu
                            "$40,000," as the minimum donation required to secure the
                            location of the school. The motion was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The Committee amendment was then rejected.</p>
                        <p>The question recurring on the Committee amendment to section 8 - </p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB opposed any such appropriation on the part of the State at this
                            time; for whenever the State, through its Legislature, prposes to keep
                            up an institution or aid it by appropriations, the Legislature may
                            depend upon it they wll have it to do. He instanced the case of the
                            Northern State Prison, which he opposed from the first, and then
                            characterized it, as it has proved itself to be, a living, eating moth
                            upon the State. He claimed that no man should go before him in favor of
                            the educational <pb n="123" xml:id="VAA8558-08-123"/>interests of the
                            country, but was opposed to taxing the people for the support of this
                            Institution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG. If this Institution is for the benefit of the people at
                            large, then it is a proper subject matter for universal contribution or
                            universal taxation. He objected to a proposition of this kind being put
                            on a level, or compared with a State penitentiary. The competition for
                            the location of this Institution will run as high whether the
                            Legislature contributes to its support or not. Then he spurned the idea
                            that an appropriation by this Legislature should act as a precedent to
                            control future Legislatures - legislators are not worthy the place if
                            they cannot act intelligently upon such questions without looking to
                            precedents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK as a friend to this bill, would like to have this $5,000
                            amendment, but did not regard it as essential. He would rather have the
                            bill as it is than to have no bill at all. It would be no difficult task
                            to show that appropriations made in this way might prevent

                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN the 8th section was stricken from the bill by

                        <p>Mr. NILES moved to amend sections 2 and 3 by giving these appointments
                            into the hands of the Governor, with the approval of the Senate, instead
                            of leaving them in the hands of the General Assembly.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, returned
                            the bill H. R. 47, to increase the powers of the Board of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners, and to authorize said Board to loan any moneys belonging
                            to said Funds in Indiana State Bonds or stocks, and providing for the
                            canceling of such bonds or stocks, and the re-issuing of new
                            non-negotiable bonds or stocks, payable to said Funds, with sundry
                            amendments, recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The first Committee amendment, striking out all after the word
                            "discretion," in the fifth line of the first section,
                            including the word "discretion," in the tenth line of the same
                            section, the discretion given to the Commissioners to loan money to
                            individuals, being read - </p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER objected to making it peremptory to purchase bonds whenever
                            there is money on hand. It is much better to leave it discretionary with
                            the Commissioners either to purchase bonds or loan the moneys on
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY favored the Committee amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN opposed the amendment; for if you gave the Commissioners no
                            discretion in this matter, they are bound by the terms of the bill to
                            invest moneys on hand in bonds immediately, and bondholders could
                            combine and demand whatever price they please. He would jealously guard
                            this fund for the educational purposes of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD thought this was a dangerous bill - it is leaving too much in
                            the hands or discretion of these commissioners. It is opening in avenue
                            for the corruption of the commissioners (not pretending to insinuate
                            that they will be corrupted) and he was unwilling to throw corruption
                            around them - to repose so much in the virtue of the commissioners. He
                            had not given the thought to the bill necessary to say how the matter
                            ought really to be dealt with; but with his present understanding of it,
                            hoped it would not pass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON could not see the force of the objection to this Committee
                            amendment, that it would raise the market price of State bonds; mtered
                            into a detailed statement of the workings of the Board of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners; and concluded by favoring the adoption of the
                            amendment.</p>

                        <p>The Senate met at 2 o'clock, and proceeded with the consideration of
                            the business pending at the time of the recess for dinner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN'S prejudices all along thave been against the changing of
                            this fund, and now he is called upon to take a choice between two evils
                            - this bill as it comes from the House, or as it is proposed to be
                            amended by the report of the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName>.He
                            spoke in opposition to the amendment under consideration, and gave his
                            reasons at length for preferring the section as it came from the
                            House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES had desired for years that this fund should be withdrawn from
                            its present channels. He had looked upon the system as fraught with evil
                            almost unmixed with good. It creates the necessity of employing a
                            multitude of officers and agents, and almost necessarily must be, in the
                            present state of society and the world, a kind of corruption fund. He
                            had frequently remarked that rather than have these funds hawked about
                            over the State, as they have been, for the sake of having one-half
                            securely invested in our public securities, he would be willing to see
                            the other half sunk in the bottom of the ocean. He proposed the
                            following substitute for the committee amendment:</p>
                        <p>And in case said bonds and obligations of the State cannot at any time be
                            purchased at a rate so deemed reasonable, said Commissioners are hereby
                            authorized to invest said funds in the bonds or other public securities
                            of the United States at not exceeding their market value, and whenever
                            thereafter said bonds of the State can be purchased at a reasonable
                            rate, said Commissioners may sell said securities of the United States
                            or any part thereof for cash, and shall immediately reinvest the
                            proceess in said bonds of the State as aforesaid</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES advocated his amendment at some length. He remarked that the
                            original bill proposed to authorize the Sinking Fund Commissioners to
                            loan out the funds to individuals in case bonds of the State cannot be
                            purchased at a reasonable price. He should regard it as a great public
                            calamity to have the sinking fund distributed through the State and
                            loaned to individuals or banks. As to those funds, it was his first
                            object to have them invested in our public debt.</p>
                        <p>The amendment proposed by the Committee would compel the Commissioners to
                            keep the funds locked up in their vaults, whenever the obligations of
                            the State can not be purchased at reasonable rates - thus necessitating
                            a loss of interest.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, his amendment would authorize the investment of funds
                            otherwise lying idle, in the bonds of the United States. Such bonds can
                            always be bought or sold in the public markets, at a well known price,
                            and till the money can be judiciously invested in our own securities,
                            would be drawing a high rate of interest, it would leave no room ibr
                            peculationcause no lossand be attended with no expense, and would bring
                            a revenue to the State.</p>
                        <p>His present object was to make the bill as perfect as possible, without
                            now determining whether it would be just to our creditors, or whether he
                            ought to vote for the bill, on its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER opposed this amendment to the Committee's amendment, on
                            the ground that it would be extreme folly for us to occupy theposition
                            of money-lender for any great length of time, while we are involved in
                            debt. All the objections urged against the Committee amendment, in his
                            judgment, applied with full force, against this one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD, after reading the bill and making some few inquiries concerning
                            it, was more favorably impressed with its provisions. He objected,
                            however, to the amendment proposed by the Senator from Laporte [Mr.
                            Niles,] and also to the amendment of the Committee. He preferred the
                            section us it comes from the House; and on reflection since the recess
                            for dinner, felt disposed to vote for the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB was not sure this bill indicates a proper mode of investing this
                            fund; but as there seems to be a disposition to push it through in some
                            shape, he desired to see it perfected, without committing himself for or
                            against it. The amendment of the Senator from Laporte was no better than
                            the Committee amendment; and his remarks were in opposition to both,
                            without going into the details of the bill. He understood, from
                            information imparted to him on the subject, that at this session there
                            would be no adjustment of the State debtthat the majority in this
                            Legislature contend it is not due. And if it is not due he was unwilling
                            to pay it, for the reason that we are now burdened with taxation, and
                            are compelled to be burdened for years to come; and it is much easier to
                            pay the interest thereon, at 2 1/2 or 5 per cent, than to pay the
                            principal at this time, or even interest at six per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. Every speech made on this question has the more firmly tixed
                            upon his mind the conclusion that both amendments should be voted down
                            and the bill passed as it now stands. This is one of the most sacred
                            funds ever placed under our control, and he had no other desire than to
                            husband the means and guard this fund in every possible way. He could
                            not help how much gentlemen protest they do not intimate but that they
                            have full confidence in the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners, the
                            action of the Senate will speak louder than words. He for one was not
                            willing, to adopt this amendment and thus say to those Commissioners:
                            " We have no confidence in you and can not let you manage this fund
                            as you may think best."</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. If what has been said on this floor be true, these Sinking
                            Fund Commissioners have violated a plain provision of law, and no matter
                            how high these gentlemen may stand personally, they are unworthy the
                            places they occupy; and he would cast his vote to take the funds as
                            speedily as possible from the control of these men - who are our
                            servants, and who should execute the law as we write it. He desired to
                            see the bill amended, and might possibly vote for both amendments now
                            before the Senate. He did not know upon what authority it was stated
                            that there would be no adjustment of the State debt this session.
                            Whether it be in fact due or not, sound policy would require us to
                            commence making provisions for its payment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON contended it would do no harm to throw around these funds
                            every possible guard; and could see no objection to the amendment
                            offered by the Senator from Laporte. He referred to the statement made
                            by the Senator from Lawrence, that there might <pb n="125" xml:id="VAA8558-08-125"/>not be an adjustment of the State debt this
                            session, and insisted that the debt should be paid on the 19th of

                        <p>The substitute [Mr. Niles'] for the Committee amendment was then
                            rejected by ayes 19, nays 27.</p>
                        <p>The question recurring on the first amendment, proposed by the
                                <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. While the Committee have all confidence in the Board of
                            Sinking Fund Commissioners, they thought it better to throw every guard
                            around this fund. The fund has already lost some $18,000 in the last six
                            months by lying idle, and this is one of the reasons for desiring to get
                            it invested in six per cent, bonds. He explained the reasons for the
                            amendments offered by the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Richmond in the Chair) spoke in opposition to the
                            amendment. Referring to the State debt, he said he felt some pride in
                            haying it paid. He was a warm advocate of the internal improvement
                            system of the State in 1836. and was proud to-day to acknowledge the
                            part he took in saddling that system upon the people of the State. It
                            was the entering wedge to that spirit of improvement which has made the
                            State powerful in times of peace and great and patriotic in time of war.
                            He was prepared to vote for the settlement of that debt, if it is due,
                            notwithstanding the fact that the people are at the present time heavily
                            taxed. But if we are not to adjust that debt now, let not the interests
                            of the children of the State stand still - let not this money lie idle
                            if the vaults of the banks here or elsewhere, but let it be placed where
                            it will be drawing interest at six per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA. The bill did not quite meet his views. He could not see that
                            this amendment gives superior protection to the rights of citizens, and
                            preferred the House bill in this particular. It was his deliberate
                            judgment that by party maneuvering, or other causes, the settlement of
                            the State debt will perhaps pass by this General Assembly, and if it
                            does, it don't require any great foresight to know that the stocks
                            of Indiana will become depressed from the very hour the Legislature
                            adjourns. Then these Commissioners can go into the market and buy up
                            these bonds and stocks, and when the State comes to a settlement, they
                            will attain their full value in the market, and the school fund will
                            derive the benefit. And if there is to be a speculation of this sort, he
                            wanted it should be made right there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON recited the provisions of the bill and proposed amendments,
                            pointing out inconsistencies as between them, and expressing the opinion
                            that this matter has not yet been considered with that care it should
                            be. It is because he desired to shield the Board of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners and enhance the value of the school fund, that he
                            contended for the passage of a measure that will provide a secure
                            investment for the moneys on hand. He opposed the loaning of this fund
                            to individuals, and for this and other reasons urged the adoption of the
                            amendment.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT explained that he voted to lay the resolution on the table
                            for several reasons; one was his opposition to that provision which
                            requires the Lieutenant Governor to superintend these Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners in this matter. While he had the highest confidence in the
                            Governor, he also had high confidence in the Commissioners, and was not
                            disposed to insult them by connecting another officer with them because
                            there is some $600,000 in their hands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON explained that he was not willing to vote for laying the
                            amendment on the table, because there is no security required by law of
                            those individuals to whom the fund may be loaned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, for the first time in his life, asked to be excused from
                            voting. Part of the amendment he was in favor of: - he was in favor of
                            preventing the loaning of these moneys to individuals; but was opposed
                            to placing the Lieutenant Governor as a superintendent over the
                            Commissioners.</p>
                        <p>The Senator was excused.</p>
                        <p>And so the amendment was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS, believing that the Committee would be able to make a report
                            satisfactory to a majority of the Senate, moved to recommit the bill and
                            pending amendments to the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN made an ineffectual motion - yeas 23, nays 23 - to lay the
                            motion to recommit on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, made an ineffectual demand for the previous
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>And then the Senate adjourned (under the rules) till 9 o'clock

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM, from the joint committee to whom was referred so much of the
                            Governor's Message as relates to the State debt, reported a
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>,
                            returned his Insurance bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_255">H. R.
                                255</ref>] recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>He also, from the same committee, returned Mr. Whiteside's
                            publication service bill [H. R. 18] with an amendment, adding
                            appropriately this: "Or such notice may be served on the attorney
                            of the person asking for new trial," &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>He also returned Mr. Caldwell's jury instructions bill [H. R. 227]
                            recommending its indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>He also returned Mr. Lasselle's pleadings bill [H. R. 228]
                            recommending that it be laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE reasoned against concurrence in the report. There was great
                            hardship in the pleadings where the maker of the note is dead. A note
                            should be received in evidence, unless it is denied under oath. The same
                            hardship might arise in cases of assignments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB showed that it was more consonant with justice, that an
                            administrator, etc., should be compelled to prove that the paper is
                            genuine, than to deny under oath that which he may know nothing
                            about.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. All notes ought to be received as <hi rend="i">prima
                                facie</hi> evidence.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. N. also returned the Insurance bill [S. 31] recommending that it be
                            laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>The report wras concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the <orgName>Committee on
                                Education</orgName>, returned Mr. Goodman's School bill, [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_237">H. R. 237</ref>] recommending that it be
                            indefinitely postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GOODMAN stated reasons in his part of the State demanding this change
                            in the law requiring extra qualifications of teachers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS thought this provision of the law ought to be suspended for
                            at least one year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN read the 136th section of the law, prescribing what branches
                            shall be taught.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK had heard complaints against the high standard for
                            qualification of teachers. He read the 34th section prescribing the
                            standard of qualifications for license. There was another section which
                            prescribes that none shall teach without license. He had heard the
                            complaint illustrated by a farmer thus: The fodder had got so high that
                            the calves, sheep and lambs would starve.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, said the <orgName>Committee on
                                Education</orgName> had been untiring in their efforts to make an
                            acceptable school bill. They were unanimous in the opinion that this
                            bill was not required. Would you give the control of this matter to an
                            ordinary school meeting, often governed by excitement? He read the 34th
                            section. No man should teach children without some knowledge of
                            physiology. He referred also to the 47th section, with reference to the
                            duty of trustees. The Superintendent of Public Instruction had informed
                            the committee that he could easily issue a circular to the Examiners
                            that would settle this difficulty. If you would educate right, start
                            right. The law did not contemplate a profound knowledge of physiology.
                            He would have practical, hard, common sense teachers, knowing something
                            of the laws of health, and the law of the land.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE. Could an individual get license without knowledge of
                            physiology?</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY. He might; but the Examiner would hardly do right, if the
                            teacher knows nothing of the laws of health.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM thought the school law ought to be modified in this respect.
                            They had got the tree so tall that it was out of sight to first limb. He
                            demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and the main
                            question was ordered, whereupon - </p>
                        <p>The House refused to concur in the report of the committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, from the <orgName>Committee on
                                Education</orgName>, returned Mr. Ferris' school bill [H. R.
                            252,] taking away restrictions as to age, recommending its indefinite
                            postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS reasoned in favor of his bill, that children under six years
                            and over twenty-one years may attend school.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH thought the gentleman was right as to persons over
                            twenty-one years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS said the committee concurred as to that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. We could reach it, then, by refusing to concur in the
                            recommendation.</p>
                        <p>[A message was now received from the Governor transmitting a
                            communication, signed by S. H. Buskirk and others, of Monroe comity,
                            proposing donations for the establishment of the State Agricultural
                            College at Bloomington, viz: The Geological and Mineralogieal Cabinet of
                            the late Dr. David Dale Owen, which could not be procured for less than
                            $15,000, and a farm in the neighborhood worth $75,000.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, it was referred to the special committee on
                            that subject.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS agreed with the gentleman from Huntington, as to his desire to
                            amend the school law - speaking in behalf of those young men who have
                            been deprived of schools by service in the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN hoped the law would not be changed according to the provisions
                            of the bill. Older persons in the schools would engross the time of the
                            teacher to the detriment of the children: and the first object of the
                            school fund would be defeated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE thought the report should not be concurred in. The
                            Constitution provides that the schools shall be "equally open <pb n="127" xml:id="VAA8558-08-127"/>to all." He caused the Article
                            to be read by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. Were blacks included in this "all?"</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. No: all white people. He commended the school system of
                            Indiana, with all its imperfections of detail, as the best in the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES demanded the previous question, and there was a second -
                            whereupon - </p>
                        <p>The House refused to indefinitely postpone the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren, also returned the Colored School Children petition
                            of D. Lockwood and others, reporting that a majority of the Committee
                            had reported a bill on that subject.</p>

                        <p>Mr. STRINGER, from the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned
                            Mr. Bonner's Road Company bill [H. R. 271;] also, Mr.

                        <p>He also returned Mr. Hoover's road bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_263">H. R. 263</ref>] with an amendment of
                            title; adding this: " And prescribing a penalty therefor."</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER, from the same Committee, returned sundry petitions for
                            amendment of the law so as to authorize swinging gates on the highways

                            for an act to authorize County Commissioners to grant the right to erect
                            swinging gates on county, township or private roads, - was now read,
                            passed to the second reading, and referred to the <orgName>Committee on
                                Rights and Privileges</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. O'Brien, Shoaft of Allen, and Richards each obtained leave
                            of absence on account of illness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cowgill's Common Carriers bill (<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_211">H. R. 211</ref>) introduced on the 16th inst., coming up on the
                            second reading, with the amendments reported by the <orgName>Committee
                                on Railroads</orgName>, requiring 60 days instead of 30 days notice,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>The amendments were concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL thought that it would be better to make the storage five
                            months instead of three months before notice of saleto make it conform
                            to the Committee's amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART said five mouths was contemplated. The bill was ordered to
                            be engrossed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gregory of Warren's joint resolution (<ref target="#HJR_1865_11_13_020">No. 20</ref>), for a memorial to
                            Congress for equality as to the additional bounty and monthly pay of
                            soldiers, coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend so as to memorialize for a direct tax to
                            pay these additional bounties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, regarded the amendment as a proposition to
                            destroy the joint resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER opposed the amendment for a tax. He would have a grant of land
                            for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB would include the suggestion in his amendment, viz: "Or
                            that, in lieu of a money bounty, a grant of land he made for the bounty
                            of such soldiers." Such a measure as that contemplated in the joint
                            resolution would reduce the value of Government bonds. There were
                            amongst us those desirous of further reducing the value of these bonds,
                            by taxing them, in violation of the act of Congress. This consideration,
                            taken together with the alternative proposition to grant lands, lie
                            thought, ought to carry the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. The resolution was now broad enough to authorize
                            a grant of thanks.</p>
                        <p>Mr MILLER proposed to amend the joint resolution by inserting
                            appropriately: "If consistent with the interests of the
                            country."</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>The vote on Mr. Newcomb's amendment discovered no quorum.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COLLINS, the House then took a recess till 2

                        <p>On motion by Mr. SHUEY, it was postponed and made the special order for
                            to-morrow at this hour - affirmative 45, negative 24.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS moved to reconsider the vote of the House of yesterday
                            rejecting the amendment of Mr. Newcomb to Mr. Shuey's temperance
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>It lies over under the rule.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE (by unanimous consent) introduced a joint resolution [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_021">H. R. 21</ref>] instructing our Senators
                            and requesting our Representatives in Congress to give their influence
                            to secure the passage of a law increasing the pension of privates and
                            non-commissioned officers in the service of the United States, [to $16
                            per monthso as to make uniformity,] which was passed to the second
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COOK (by consent) presented the petition of John Rolliner and 1,100
                            others, for an amendment of the license law so as to hold minors
                            responsible for impositions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STEWART (by unanimous consent) submitted a concurrent resolution
                            instructing our Senators and requesting our Representatives to secure
                            such a modification of the act of April 19, 1816, appropriating the 16th
                            section for common school purposes, as to provide that where said 16th
                            section has been disposed of, some section contiguous thereto shall be
                            granted for the use of schools.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STEWART stated the discrepancies between Congressional and civil
                            townships, involving considerable labor. It was intended to do away with
                            the resulting unnecessary labor on the part of the Township Trustees,
                            Auditors and Superintendents. It had been <pb n="129" xml:id="VAA8558-08-129"/> examined and approved by the
                            Superintendent of Public Instruction; and that officer was anxious for
                            the measure. It would save about six pages in the school law.</p>
                        <p>The resolution was adopted.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) his back pay and
                            bounty bill No. 156 was taken up. He knew that debate was not in order;
                            but he would have unanimous consent to submit an amendment, so as to
                            limit the office of the Washington Commissioner to two years. He also
                            desired to amend so as to give the Governor the power of removal over
                            these officers as well as the power of appointment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER objected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT would then submit the bill again to the vote.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays resulted - yeas, 45; nays, 35.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL, when his name was called, alleged that he should vote no,
                            because it was a proposition to create new offices "to eat out the
                            substance of the people."</p>
                        <p>So the bill fails for want of a constitutional majority.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER announced the consideration of Mr. Meredith's joint
                            resolution No. 1, for amendment of the State Constitution, by striking
                            out the thirteenth article thereof - the question being on the third
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. MILLER, a call of the House was ordered and proceeded;
                            and when the Clerk reported eighty-five members present and answering,
                            further proceedings were dispensed with under this order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved to postpone and make it the special order for Saturday, 2
                            o'clock P. M. If this course were taken, some gentlemen would have
                            opportunity to express their views against this proposition. To force it
                            to a final vote now would violate plighted faith on the part of the
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. For one he was perfectly willing that the majority should
                            pass it, reserving to ourselves the right of appeal to the people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. That was but a difference of opinion between two great men.
                            (Laughter.) But if gentlemen think best to press the vote this dark and
                            lowering afternoon - the tint of the atmosphere corresponding with the
                            color of the proposition - let them do it and stifle debate to the
                            disregard of plighted faith.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB replied to the imputation of disregarding plighted faith.
                            There would be time for us all to ventilate our rhetoric on some kindred
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown's motion was rejected.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Griffith's joint resolution No. 17, to amend sec. 3 of art. 4 of
                            the State Constitution so as to provide for annual sessions of the
                            General Assembly, coming up - it was ordered to engrossment and third
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK considered that the proposition was right.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM thought we had enough of legislation - such as it is.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH doubted at this time the propriety of any amendment to the
                            fundamental law. We have just emerged from war, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. The State of Ohio was compelled to make a similar amendment
                            to their new Constitution. He thought it was manifestly the wisest
                            course here now to give the proposition a trial before the people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER agreed with Mr. Dunham. A called session would dispose of
                            business cheaper, in less time, and to better satisfaction, than when a
                            new organization is made and new officers are to be elected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB had always regarded this <pb n="130" xml:id="VAA8558-08-130"/>system of biennial sessions as a wasteful one. A called session always
                            exposed the Governor to unpleasant partisan imputations. He reasoned at
                            length in favor of the proposition, replying in detail to the
                            objections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY spoke in favor of the proposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK pursued the argument in favor of the joint resolution -
                            alleging losses to the school and other funds for lack of a just
                            taxation; and heavy losses to the State on account of executive
                            usurpations in the absence of legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM expressed his opinion and experience. He submitted whether
                            there had not been as odious usurpation when the Legislature has been in
                            session as when not in session? If laws passed once in two years will
                            not restrain them, laws passed every year would not. "The world is
                            governed too much; " and herein Was and always had been the
                            difficulty in the State of Indiana, The great general principles of
                            legislation stand from age to age. He was for the stability, the
                            un-changeability of laws once received and accepted as wholesome and
                            just.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY replied, showing the insufficiency of time for legislation, as
                            the Constitution now stands. The evils complained of were referable to
                            hasty legislation, on account of the restriction as to time.</p>
                        <p>The joint resolution was rejected - yeas 39, nays 48.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. KILGORE, the House (at 4:45) adjourned.</p>

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. The first section of this bill is very lame - it
                            jeopardizes this fund. He did not distrust the capacity or honesty of
                            the Commissioners, but he objected to that provision which empowers them
                            to lend this fund in accordance with laws heretofore passed. By passing
                            this bill you repeal all laws heretofore passed coming in conflict
                            therewith, then what law is there governing the loaning of this
                            money?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. The law of 1859. In his judgment the provision for the loaning
                            of this fund is not in conflict with that law. But if this bill does
                            repeal that Act, it is a fair deduction of law that it revives the old
                            law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON. Our own Supreme Court have decided that no act of the
                            Legislature shall be revived by a subsequent enactment, unless it is so
                            expressly stated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS was sorry to see Senators running against the Constitution,
                            which says: "No act shall be revised or amended by mere reference
                            to its title," (and this bill does not go even that far,) "but
                            the act revised or section amended, shall be set forth and published at
                            full length."</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB made an ineffectual demand for the previous question -
                            affirmative 21, negative 22.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY moved to strike out that portion of the bill which gives
                            authority to the Sinking Fund Commissioners to loan the money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN raised the point of order that a similar proposition having
                            been voted down by the Senate, this amendment is not in order.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. BRADLEY and VAWTER contended that the point of order was not well
                            founded.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>, was inclined to think the
                            amendment in order, and so decided.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON was forcibly struck with the propriety of this amendment, and
                            believed a sense of duty as a representative of a portion of the State,
                            required that his voice should be heard in opposition to the loose
                            manner in which that bill, as it now stands, is placing the most sacred
                            fund that belong to future generations. He believed the intention of the
                            people of the State and of members of this Legislature was that these
                            Sinking Fund Commissioners should invest the means belonging to the
                            various funds of the State in their hands in the outstanding indebtness
                            of the State and bring it home. He found the ablest Attorneys on this
                            floor disputing as to the restrictions or powers conferred by this bill;
                            and proceeded to make a lengthy argument earnestly urging the adoption
                            of the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT could not consent to vote for this bill unless some
                            restrictions are thrown around it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK thought all doubts should enure to the benefit of this
                            fund; and in order that this matter may be inquired into, he moved the
                            reference of the bill to the <orgName>Committee on the
                                Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG favored the motion to refer, not as an opponent of the bill,
                            but wishing for a fair investigation of the question as to what effect
                            this act would have upon the law of 1859; and as to the weight of other
                            points which have beeen raised during the discussion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER resisted the motion to recommit because of the necessary delay,
                            not to this bill only but to other matters of legislation; and because
                            he believed all the light that can be thrown on this matter is now
                            before the Senate. He moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>This latter motion was rejected by yeas 21, nays 27.</p>
                        <p>The question recurring on the motion to recommit - </p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB could see no good to result from a recommitment of the bill. He
                            was willing to risk this fund where the bill places it, and believed the
                            effect of referring it to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
                            would be to jeopardize its passage; and that the object of the motion
                            was to defeat the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK disclaimed that. On the contrary, he desired the bill
                            should pass, with proper restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. These Commissioners have been blamed for retaining so large a
                            sum of money contrary to the provisions of law; but they did so upon the
                            advice of Governor Morton, and other friends of the fund. And he
                            understood there was an arrangement already made by which they can
                            invest this money in bonds at a benefit to the fund of about $200,000,
                            in case this bill passes. He argued at length the merits of the bill.Mr.
                            CASON disclaimed the statement that the object of reference was to kill
                            the bill - its oldest and warmest friends are now desiring the
                            reference. He hoped the motion would prevail, and that the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> may bring in a report
                            deciding the question by what law this fund is to be loaned. A
                            conversational debate across the chamber brought out the concession from
                            Senators, both opposed and in favor of the bill, that gentlemen in
                            the'House of Representatives who drove the bill through that body
                            last session were now anxious to see it "squelched."</p>

                            passage of this bill, and would not do so, but would like to <pb n="133" xml:id="VAA8558-08-133"/>have it amended, by unanimous consent of
                            the Senate, so as to include the case of the Treasurer of Brown county,
                            which he urged last session, in the provisions of this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB gave notice that if this bill passes he should offer a similar
                            one for the relief of one of his constituents - an ex-treasurer - a case
                            as meritorious as this one can possibly be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING withdrew his amendment, and gave notice that should this bill
                            pass he would introduce a bill providing for the case of Mr. Williams,
                            ex-treasurer of Monroe county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON referred to the case of an ex-treasurer of Henry county - as
                            honest a man as ever the sun of Heaven shone upon - for whose relief he
                            would introduce a bill in case this one passes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG urged the passage of the measure, giving additional reasons

                        <p>Mr. TERRY referred to a petition which had come up here praying for the
                            relief of Mr. Mann, late Treasurer of Fulton county, who was robbed of
                            some $4,000 belonging to the State; and whose family are now in want
                            because of his having to pay this loss out of his own means. And it is
                            thought by some his death was hastened by this misfortune. If any case
                            of this kind is relieved by legislative enactment this should be one
                            among the first to receive attention.</p>

                            dividing the State into counties, defining their boundaries, etc., was
                            taken up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, since this bill was up the other day had ascertained
                            that the citizens of Jay county, sought by this bill to be attached to
                            the county of Blackford, were unanimously opposed to the arrangement. He
                            called attention to a Constitutional provison which bears upon this bill
                            - section 7, article xv. The county of Jay comes in under the second
                            clause of this section. That provision of the Constitution would make a
                            bill of this kind unconstitutional if passed. He moved to recommit the
                            bill to the Judiciary Committee, that they may inquire into the matter
                            and report thereon.</p>

                            of cities, towns, townships and school districts may tax themselves for
                            schools without regard to a uniform rate, recommending its indefinite
                            postponement, for the reason that the House has passed a resolution from
                            the Senate on the same subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS stated the distinction between his joint resolution and that
                            from the Senate his resolution authorizing the special taxation In

                            form. He showed the importance of extending this privilege to the
                            townships and school districts - as now authorized in the State of
                            Illinois, where these common schools were advanced so as to be justly
                            regarded as the best schools in that State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL replied, that it would make distinctions in schools, and
                            overthrow the system.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. There was a salutary practical illustration of it in the State

                        <p>Mr. LANE looked favorably on the joint resolution; it would be
                            inconsistent to favor the cities to the neglect of the townships and

                        <p>After debate by Mr. SIM, Mr. HENRICKS, and Mr. BUSKIRK,On motion by Mr.

                            Committee consisting of Messrs. Newcomb and Henricks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN introduced a bill [H. R, 293] for an act to amend sec. 4 of the
                            act containing several provisions regarding landlords, tenents, lessors
                            and lessees, approved May 20,1852.</p>
                        <p>It was passed to the second reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Hamriek in the Chair) introduced a bill [H. R. 294] for
                            an act to provide for securing to the Common School fund sums forfeited
                            on recognizances, and the modes for declaring their forfeiture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. P. explained that if these forfeited recognizances were properly
                            husbanded, an addition might be made annually to the school fund of from
                            $50,000 to $100,000. But the present system not only entirely failed to
                            bring anything into the fund, but if the person arraigned is able to get
                            bail, he may constantly defy the demands of justice. It was also a
                            principal object of the bill to prevent these conspiracies between
                            criminals and their wealthy friends. It was to make the forfeiture
                            absolute the second time the culprit runs away, so that it cannot be
                            relieved except upon remission of the Governor.</p>

                            Wallace, President of the Board of Trustees of the State Benevolent
                            Institutions, and the Report of the Board of Control of the Northern

                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE introduced a bill [H. R. 295] for an act to amend section 1

                            forfeited recognizance in criminal proceedings shall become an absolute
                            judgment against the bail, and collected without suit thereon.It was

                            evils of the license law, in jail fees, poor house expenses, and the
                            denial of justice in civil actions, because of the amount of criminal

                            affected by drunkenness?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM said his objection was not that the money should go to the
                            county where the license is paid. But his objection was the diversion of
                            the school fund. If the gentleman would change his bill so that this
                            money shall be apprpriated to the school fund in each county, he would
                            go for ithave the money appropriated in the township where
                            collected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB would move to commit it to the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName> for modification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY The object of the author of the bill would include the
                            modification suggested.</p>
                        <p>The bill was referred to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>

                        <p>The Speaker announced the special order, viz: the consideration of Mr.
                            Shuey's Temperance bill [H. R. 218] - the question being on the
                            third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, took the floor, speaking of the deep popular
                            feeling on the subject of Temperance, exhibited in the numerous memorals
                            for the discouragement and suppression of tippling saloons. These were
                            the great objects of popular complaint, and the Legislature should hear
                            the popular voice in this regard. It was the protection of society that
                            was involved in this question. When a Government was not founded in just
                            moral principles, it contained within itself the elements of its own
                            destructionto which he instanced the institution of slavery. Immorality
                            would disregard law; and intemperance was immoralitythe parent of many
                            vices. The suppression of intemperance would dispense with much of the
                            expense of the execution of the criminal laws.He inveighed against the
                            liquor trafficer as worse than the murdererthe assassin. Theft, arson,
                            incendiarism, were venial crimes in comparison with those that poison
                            the youth of the land with liquor. And yet these men received the
                            protection of law. They opened the gates of hell in every street and
                            alley, and on every cross-roads in the land. Should not the popular
                            voice be regarded? He was pained to see, in numerous motions to postpone
                            and to amend, that the voice of the people was not to be regarded here.
                            He cared not for the political power supposed to be involved, and plead
                            simply for the morality of the question He replied to the constitutional
                            and commercial objections to the prohibition of liquor. Total
                            prohibition was the same in principle as the prohibition of the traffic
                            on election day. But if society could not be protected by direct
                            legislation, he asked for the people the power to protect themselves in
                            the provisions of the pending bill. He made an earnest appeal for the
                            passage of the bill without further amendment. The County Commissioners
                            would meet next Monday, and the opportunity to re-strain the traffic for
                            the coining year by the passage of this bill was now lost; but still he
                            would have the bill. Better late than never.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. No man appreciated the virtues of Temperance and Sobriety
                            more highly than he. However we might differ as to the means of
                            accomplishing the common relief on this subject, still we all desired to
                            come to it. He knew that his views of the subject were not popular. He
                            would change our whole system of legislation on this liquor question. He
                            would not license, but would leave the whole matter in the hands of the
                            people at large. License conferred respectability. This tippling
                            business, like all others, should be regulated by the laws of trade.
                            Such would be his plan. Day before yesterday he saw a large delegation
                            of ladies in this House, to press the adoption of this measure by their
                            influence. And no man was insensible to that influence - it was
                            recognized in the speech of his friend (Mr. Rice) before him. He then
                            referred to the home and family influence of woman as superior for good
                            to all acts of legislation on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Here was the orbit of the influence of woman, which was to shape the
                            character of the nation. Wherever the mother's sigh and the
                            sister's prayer were unheard, there was no hope of reformation in
                            such a subject. He would vote to-day for an appropriation for a hospital
                            to which such men should be sent; and there was neither religion nor
                            statesmanship in leaving society to take care of itself in this regard.
                            But could legislation reach the case? The iron heel of military power
                            could not restrain the appetite to drink. You could not restrain it any
                            more than you could restrain the flood of waters in the Ohio river.
                            Then, if we can not do what we would, we must do what we can; if we can
                            not dam up the tide we may turn it.</p>
                        <p>If gentlemen believe that they can control this appetite they ought to do
                            it; but, if they do not, then tie it up by license. He voted against the
                            Sunday liquor bill the other day not that he did not regard the Sabbath,
                            (for he did,) but because he regarded the Constitution which prescribes
                            that legislation shall not regulate religion - shall not prefer one
                            sacred day above another. But he undertook to say that this bill if it
                            became a law, could not be enforced. He concurred with the gentleman who
                            said in this debate, that you can not enforce a law when it is not
                            demanded by the public sentiment. Was it not then to provoke and teach
                            the violation of law, to enact a law that can not be enforced? He
                            illustated by the neglect <pb n="137" xml:id="VAA8558-08-137"/> of the
                            13th Article of the Constitution, uid the legislation in pursuance
                            thereof; he also instanced the temperance mobs of men 'iii'd
                            women despite the legal sanctions. He regarded this temperance
                            legislation as a chronic habit in this State, and about as inveterate as
                            the habit of the common drinker.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ZEIGLER was not alarmed at the cry of constitutionality. The
                            Constitution had been constantly violated for the past five years, if we
                            listen to some. Should we refrain wholly from legislation, because laws
                            do not accomplish the ends they aim at? He alleged his own favorable
                            opinion of this bill, and answered objections, replying specially to Mr.
                            Dunham and Mr. Newcomb, deprecating the amendment of the latter; and he
                            concluded by reciting the considerations that commanded his vote for the
                            bill. It would remove a perplexing responsibility from the County
                            Commissioners. It gave control of the traffic directly to the people. It
                            was no objection to say it was an experiment; because no good could come
                            of invention without experiment. Then this bill was demanded by the
                            people: and if it had been pressed at the opening of the session, he
                            believed it would have been passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said he could have had plain sailing on this question, if he
                            had gone with the current; and if he yet should vote for the bill, it
                            would be, not because it was supported by his own judgment, but in
                            obedience to the desires of his constituents. Was it singular that he
                            should be interested in perfecting a bill in which his constituents were
                            deeply interested? and especially was his propositions to amend to be
                            deprecated when gentlemen conceded that the original bill would not do
                            the cities any good? and was it not also conceded that it was hardly
                            needed in the rural districts? The printed matter of the petitions for
                            this bill indicated that this form of demand for a bill was not the
                            spontaneous action of the people. With the same means at his command he
                            could get a stronger expression in favor of his amendments.</p>
                        <p>We must act practically. Can we enforce this bill? Where and when in a
                            city was drinking ever suppressed by voting down license. lie recited
                            and defended the provisions of the substitute, which he admitted to be
                            an experiment. He would have much preferred, if he could, to have
                            followed the judgment of others in his action here, and so avoided the
                            imputations that have been cast upon him. We ought to do nothing in
                            legislation, unless we think we can make some improvement. He replied to
                            Mr. Dunham. For himself, he would prefer to repeal all license laws,
                            making the liquor vender responsible for the consequences of his
                            acts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said it was impossible to-day to get an expression of the
                            representatives of the people on this bill, and regretted the necessity
                            that would compel its friends to ask for a further postponement. He
                            suggested Monday, 2 o'clock p. M. He had prepared the bill with
                            reference to the wants of the people in his county. He candidly admitted
                            that this bill could hardly be enforced in the cities. It would not be
                            as efficient in the cities as the amendment of the gentleman from
                            Marion. But there was a preponderating interest in this matter outside
                            of the cities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN said his mind was made up, and he was ready for the vote. There
                            was an admission that the bill would do no good in the cities. He would
                            therefore waste no more time about it. He would dispose of it finally
                            and at once, and go to more needful legislation. He did not like the
                            bill, and he had before signified his earnest opposition to the
                            amendment of the gentleman from Marion. He was satisfied with the act of
                            1859, whose provisions he recited. The fault was not with the act of
                            1859, but with the people in that they did not call proper men to the
                            bar to prosecute those who violate the criminal laws; the fault was with
                            those who refused to execute the laws as they are; and there was an
                            utter fault somewhere in circulating petitions for a bill, and sending
                            up here the particular form of a bill, which its friends admit can not
                            be enforced. The right to sell whisky was as distinct as the right to
                            sell milk. Legislation was to restrain and punish the abuse of the right
                            to the detriment of society.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE desired to postpone the vote to Tuesday at 2 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE preferred postponement. He would go on the record against the
                            bill in the hope of getting a better.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM and Mr. COFFROTH preferred that the House come to the vote
                            this evening. The bill (said the latter) had got into such a position
                            that there must be a district vote on it. One section, that which
                            provides imprisonment for a second violation, was corroborated by his
                            judgment. The difficulty about the enforcement of license laws in the
                            city, was in the want of adequate penalty. There was nothing in the
                            constitutional objection. But his only purpose was to induce the friends
                            of the bill" to come at once to the vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFTH urged postponement till Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM desired unanimous consent to move to make the bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">No. 285</ref> a special order.

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN, from the <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, returned
                            Mr. Bennett's bill [S. No. 209] and Mr. Culver's bill [S. No.
                            189] for Acts to apportion Senators and Representatives for the next
                            four years; recommending the passage of the former and that the latter
                            bill lie on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS had a substitute in preparation for the bill S. No. 209; and
                            moved that the bills and report be laid on the table and made the
                            special order for Wednesday next at 2 o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER said the bill did not meet with his approval. It disfranchises,
                            in the lower House, his immediate constituents, which he was not
                            disposed to submit to. As far as the Senatorial representation is
                            concerned, I have no objection to that, although it is not as much as we
                            are entitled to; but we have enjoyed a little excess of our rights in
                            the House, as an offset to that. I therefore shall feel disposed to
                            oppose the bill as long as I can. From my position as a member of the
                                <orgName>Committee on Elections</orgName>, I do not want the Senate
                            to understand me as endorsing that report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. I am one of the minority of that Committee. A bill acceptable
                            to the minority was handed to the Senator from Vigo, I understand, and
                            he is not here now. I understand the minority desire to make a report,
                            and I move to postpone the further consideration of this subject till
                            next Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>. That is the motion of the
                            Senator from Knox.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. Ah; I had just come in; I did not understand the question. I
                            hope the motion will prevail.</p>
                        <p>The motion to make the bills and report the special order for Wednesday
                            next at 2 o'clock P. M. was agreed to.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CORBIN moved to refer it to the <orgName>Special Committee on
                                Railroad Appraisements</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON explained that the only object <pb n="139" xml:id="VAA8558-08-139"/>he had in offering the resolution was to
                            obtain information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON stated that the Auditor had obtained judgment against the New
                            Albany Railroad; and that suits were pending or being brought against
                            the Peru and other railroads, which would bring to the State about
                            $1,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON. If this bill would put a quietus to the suits already
                            pending, the Senate ought to know that fact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN. My object in making the motion to refer arises from this
                            fact. The minority report embodies all the facts the resolution
                            anticipates, &amp; as it was drawn up under the supervision and
                            direction of the officers of State, (as I understand) it is
                            substantially their report. I do not think any further information from
                            that quarter can be got, and consequently I see no necessity for passing
                            the resolution. I might say that we unanimously adopted our report in
                            the first place; but the next morning the Senator from Jennings [Mr.
                            Vawter] informed me that he did not desire to have the report made as
                            unanimous, because he wanted to make a minority report; and as I saw him
                            in consultation with the Auditor of State, (I suppose for the purpose of
                            getting up this report) is the reason I say I suppose it was gotten up
                            under the authority of the Auditor of State - which I believe to be a
                            fact.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON would interpose no objection to the resolution going before
                            any Committee of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN withdrew his motion.</p>
                        <p>The resolution was then adopted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. G. said it was for the purpose of raising school houses. Such a
                            provision of law was required in a great many localities; to his
                            knowledge particularly in the counties of Noble and Lagrange.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Would it not be better to pass a general law allowing
                            public officers to take just what property they want of the people? This
                            proposition seems to assume that the people are very patient - that they
                            stand well without wincing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. I recollect that, last winter, when this subject was under
                            consideration, the gentleman from Huntington was in favor of a tax of
                            forty cents on the hundred dollars.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. It was fifty cents. Perhaps it might be conceded to him,
                            that as he gets older he gets wiser.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. HIGGINS the resolution was laid on the table - yeas 59,

                        <p>Mr. MILLER obtained the unanimous consent of the House to return from the
                                <orgName>Committee on the Organization of Courts of
                                Justice</orgName>, Mr. Newcomb's bills, numbered <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_277">277</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_278">278</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_279">279</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_280">280</ref>, to amend sections 2 and 5 of
                            the Act for the organization of Circuit Courts, etc., etc., recommending
                            their passage.</p>
                        <p>He also, on behalf of the same Committee, introduced a bill [H. R. 300]
                            to amend section 19 of the General Practice Act of June 18, 1852. He
                            said this bill was nothing more than what was required to carry into
                            effective operation the foregoing bills authorizing a criminal court in
                            the city of Indianapolis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. As this is a judicial proposition, whereby our Judiciary
                            system is to be changed somewhat; and as it is very difficult for
                            members to know from the Clerk's reading exactly what is
                            comprehended in these bills, making a radical change in the system, I
                            would suggest the propriety of printing them. He moved that the bills be
                            laid on the table and 100 copies be printed.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER, No motion can be in order reaching beyond the matter now
                            before the House, which is the bill No. 300.</p>
                        <p>The Committee bill No. 300 was passed to the second reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH now moved to take up these series of bills, by suspension of
                            the regular order of business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS thought it hardly worth while to print these bills, which
                            apply to not more than three or four cities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The cost would not exceed $12 or $ 15.</p>
                        <p>The motion to suspend the order and take up these bills was agreed to;
                            and the printing was ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained that these bills apply to counties having 110,000
                            voters.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the said bills, numbered <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_277">277</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_278">278</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_279">279</ref>, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_280">280</ref>, were read the second time and

                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS and Mr. BROWN. Under a very recent decision of the Supreme

                            forfeiture in such a case. Mr. H. asked for unanimous consent of the
                            House to move to reconsider the vote taken a few days ago by which the
                            House rejected the bill [S. No. 61] amending the act of May 20, 1854,

                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS. That motion requires a call of the yeas and nays, and as it
                            wrould tell the story that there is no quorum present, our whole
                            evening's work would then be stopped.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>, thought there was a quorum. He
                            could soon tell.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES. If there is any danger let it lie over for the present. The
                            design of the bill is to stop some supposed leaks from the Treasury. If
                            that can be done, of course all will be willing to advance the bill.</p>
                        <p>The motion to suspend the constitutional restriction was agreed to by

                        <p>Its title was partially read.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT. Is it the pleasure of the Senate that the bill shall be
                            read by title for the purpose of reference; or shall it be read by
                            sections?</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN inquired whether that bill has been before the Committee on
                            this subject. He is a member of that Committee and did not remember of
                            its being before them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMSON, as Chairman of the Committee, had insulted members to its
                            meeting and thought all were present. He hoped the bill would be read
                            through that members of the Committee not present might hear it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE is a member of the Committee and knew nothing of the bill till
                            he heard it reported here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells, moved that the bill be recommitted to the Committee
                            on that subject in order that all the members of that Committee may have
                            an opportunity of examining it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN could not see the propriety of recommitting this bill. A
                            resolution was introduced here referring that subject to a Select
                            Committee; the Committee was notified by its Chairman of its meeting,
                            and if the members did not see proper to be there, he did not think it
                            worth while to retard the progress of the bill by recommitting it to the
                            same Committee from which it was reported. As early action should be
                            taken upon it, he moved to lay the motion to recommit on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells. Will the Senator withdraw that motion for an
                            explanation why the motion to recommit is made?</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. Yes sir.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN understood that several members of that Committee were not
                            present at the meeting when the bill was acted upon, and from
                            intimations recieved, was led to believe they were not notified of a
                            meeting of the Committee. Such being the fact he thought it nothing more
                            than right that the bill should be recommitted.</p>
                        <p>Mr: THOMPSON. The gentleman's information is incorrect. It is an
                            imputation against the Chairman of the Committee - </p>
                        <p>Mr, BROWN, (interposing) Not at all, sir, not at all. I exhonorate the
                            Chairman of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro. tem</hi>, remarked that he made an
                            announcement a few evenings ago, for the meeting of the special
                            Committee, in behalf of its Chairman.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN then renewed his motion to lay the motion to recommit, on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>This motion was rejected.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was agreed to.</p>

                            Constitution, by striking out the 13th Article thereof; coming up in
                            regular order - </p>
                        <p>It was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE moved to indefinitely postpone the resolution; and demanded the
                            yeas and nays on this motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT hoped as this is a matter of considerable interest, and one
                            which the people of the State are divided upon; that the motion to
                            indefinitely postpone would be withdrawn. He had not made a count of the
                            Senate, but if he were to find out there were a less number of Democrats
                            than Republicans present he would not be for making the attempt to pass
                            this joint resolution. The Senator [Mr. Moore] ought to: withdraw the
                            motion till we shall have a full Senate when all can have a chance to
                            vote on it. He did not think this a fair way of disposing of the
                            resolution. It is a proposition the Senator is probably opposed to and
                            it may be the Senator's constituents are opposed to'it; but it
                            is one that he [Mr. B.] was in favor of, and his people were in favor of
                            it. He hoped that this subject would be made the special order for some
                            day when we may have a full Senate,and then this motion would be a
                            proper one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE, if the opposition desire to make a record, had no objections
                            to accommodating them. He withdrew the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS (in his seat.) Let us have the yeas and nays on the question
                            of passing it to the third reading.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Downey'sbill [S. No. 148] to amend sections 76 and 78 of An Act
                            providing for the settlement of decedent's estates, etc., approved
                            June 17,1852, coming up in regular order - </p>
                        <p>It was read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES explained that as the law now stands, when application is made
                            by the Administrator to sell real estate, he is only required to publish
                            and post up notices, even if the party resides in another part of the
                            State. This is amended by the bill so that where the parties reside
                            within the State notice must be actually served upon them, as in other
                            cases. The other modification is this: as the law now stands many think
                            that where an order is made for the sale of land at private sale, notice
                            must be published that the Administrator is going to sell. That seems to
                            be altogether superficial. And so the Committee recommended the passage
                            of the bill.</p>
                        <p>The question being shall the bill pass?</p>
                        <p>A constitutional provision requiring the yeas and nays, they were

                        <p>Mr. COBB demanded a call of Senate.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>, directed the Secretary to call

                            to consist of Messrs. Moore, Cobb, Hord, Wright and Beeson.</p>
                        <p>When this report was read Mr. COBB resisted its recommendation in a few
                            remarks; and after the motion to refer was made, he insisted on the
                            reference. Upon the appointment of the Select Committee he asked they
                            should have leave of absence to consider the bill - and make an
                            immediate report thereon. He desired that the Reporter should take note
                            of his interest in the bill. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi>. The Reporter will notice the
                            course of the Senator from Lawrence [Mr. Cobb] and add at the bottom
                            that I heartily concur in his action, as it is a bill in which I am
                            deeply interested. [Renewed merriment.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>,
                            returned Mr. Brown of Well's town-sewer bill S. No. 208;
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD, from the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>,
                            returned his limited partnership bill No. 62; recommending its reference
                            to the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned
                            Mr. Dykes' bill S. No. 272 amending section 12 of the school law of
                            1865; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE moved to strike out "50 cents" and insert
                            "25."</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON hoped the discretion to levy a tax for this amount would not
                            be taken away from the people; and gave reasons.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT explained that this was not levying a tax by us, but leaving
                            it to the people interested to sav whether they shall levy a tax not
                            exceeding fifty cents for the repairs or building of school houses.</p>
                        <pb n="147" xml:id="VAA8558-08-147"/>
                        <p>Mr. MASON thought the bill a good one; and opposed the amendment. He
                            would be pilling to vote for a higher sum in this case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE withdrew his amendment, and moved to lay the bill on the table.
                            He understood it was for the benefit of towns not incorporated, at the
                            expense of the township. For that reason he opposed it.</p>
                        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 5, nays 34.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then passed to the second reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr.

                            original jurisdiction in divorce cases, with amendments; recommending
                            its passage.</p>
                        <p>The amendments were concurred in, by consent, and the bill was passed to
                            the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                            bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_135">H. R. 135</ref>, changing the law

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned

                            defective acknowledgements of deeds in certain cases; recommending its
                            passage. The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned his

                            passage.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. DOWNEY, the bill was further amended so as to make
                            depositions already taken and on file competent evidence.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>

                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY. I offer the following resolution; and I wish to say, for the
                            purpose of calling the attention of the Committee to which I have
                            reference in the resolution, that I understand from county officers in
                            one of the counties I represent that there is at. present no person
                            whose duty it is to have charge of the public buildings of the county. I
                            think we once had a law which required the Sheriff to perform that duty,
                            but, as I understand from one of the members of the Board of County
                            Commissioners of one of the counties I represent, there is now no law on
                            that subject. He is a careful gentleman, and has called my attention to
                            it frequently, and I therefore introduce this resolution, calling the
                            attention of the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                                Business</orgName> to that subject.</p>

                            forward this matter as much as possible. I believe the Governor has said
                            in his message that we have not had such an enumeration for 14 years,
                            notwithstanding the positive command of the Constitution itself. I ask
                            that it may be read by title and referred to the Committee having the

                            Peace in State prosecutions approved May 29, 1852. [Inserting the words
                            "and costs" in line 2 of section 18, and striking out these

                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Allison in the chair.) I desire to introduce a bill

                        <p>Mr. DUNNING. The Senator from White [Mr. Wood], desires to add
                            appropriately in the bill, a provision that the school examiner may also
                            grant license upon private examination at any time, and shall make that
                            private examination upon written application.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT thought that proposition, in effect, would do away with all
                            the benefits of public examinations; the good teachers will be willing
                            to go there, but the poor ones will demand a private examination.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING admitted the force of the argument, but, in behalf of the
                            Senator from White, proposed to limit the granting of licenses on
                            private examination till the time of the public examination.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS the whole matter was referred to the Committee
                            on Education.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON introduced a bill [S. No. 296] for An Act to empower
                            incorporated cities, to erect and construct gas works, and issue bonds
                            for the purpose of procuring the necessary means, and to levy a tax for
                            the payment of said bonds, and making the bonds a lien upon such works;
                            which was read the first time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON introduced a bill [S. No. 297] for An Act supplementary to
                            An Act entled An Act defining felonies and prescribing punishment
                            therefor, approved June 11, 1852. [Where a jury fixes the term of
                            imprisonment at one year or less in the State's prison, the
                            defendant may be imprisoned at hard labor in the jail of the county,
                            under the direction of the jailor.] It was read the first time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. T. said this was an important bill to the counties. When a woman is
                            imprisoned in jail she is put to hard work; but when a man is imprisoned
                            for less than a year he is idle. He moved that the rules be suspended
                            and that the bill be read the second time now.</p>
                        <p>This motion was agreed to - yeas 34, navs 0 - and the bill was passed to
                            the third reading</p>

                        <p>On motion by Mr. BENNETT (at the request of the Clerks of the House) the
                            bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_270">H. R.No. 270</ref> fixing the per

                            Door-Keepers and other employees thereof, was read the first time.</p>
                        <p>On his further motion the Constitutional restriction was dispensed with -
                            yeas 35, nays 0;the bill was read by title only and referred to the
                            Special Committee on that subject.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, Mr. Bradley's State Agency, Sinking Fund
                            Commissioner and State Debt bill S. No. 279, was read by title only.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to refer the bill to a Committee of one from each
                            Congressional District.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS opposed the raising of so many special committees, and moved
                            to amend by referring it to the Committee of the Whole and make it the
                            order for Saturday morning at 9 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN this amendment was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on

                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN this motion was also laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>The motion to refer to a special committee was agreed to.</p>

                        <p>The PRESIDENT, <hi rend="i">pro tem</hi> announced the consideration of
                            the special order for this hour, viz: Mr. Wood's bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_219">S. No. 219</ref>, defining who shall be
                            a competent witness in any court in this State - all persons, without

                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, from a minority of the <orgName>Committee on Rights
                                and Privileges</orgName>,to which this bill was referred, submitted
                            a minority report, arguing the question, and closing with a
                            recommendation that the bill lie on the table.</p>
                        <p>It is as follows:</p>
                        <p>MR. PRESIDENT : The undersigned, of the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
                                Privileges of the inhabitants of the State</orgName>, begs leave to
                            submit the following minority report upon Senate bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_219">No, 219</ref>.</p>
                        <p>The bill contemplates such a change of the existing law in relation to
                            witnesses as will permit <hi rend="i">Indians</hi> and <hi rend="i">Negroes</hi> to testify, without any restrictions in the Courts of
                            this State. So far as the former race is concerned the law would have
                            but little practical effect, and it probably was not suggested by any
                            considerations in behalf of that fast receding but interesting people.
                            The philanthropy that could, through so many long years, sleep over any
                            rights that might be deemed to have been <pb n="149" xml:id="VAA8558-08-149"/> withheld from the red man would not now
                            awaken to so keen a sense of his supposed wrongs. We may, therefore,
                            quite properly consider the bill with reference only to the negro.</p>
                        <p>Of the live different races into which the human family has been
                            classified, the Caucasian, Or white race, presents the highest type of
                            man, and the Ethiopian, or black race, the lowest. It is in this lowest
                            class that the negro is found. Considering the question of his
                            inferiority as a race, an eminent English authority holds the following
                            language:</p>
                        <p>"While numberless European and Asiatic nations have attained to a
                            high state of civilization, they, (the negroes) continue, with few
                            exceptions, in nearly primeval barbarism. It is in vain to pretend that
                            this is the result of the unfavorable circumstances under which they
                            have been placed. An intelligent, enterprising people contend against
                            unfavorable circumstances under which they are placed and make them
                            become favorable; but the Africans, with the questionable exception of
                            the ancient inhabitants of the Nile, have never discovered any
                            considerable degree of enterprise or invention, or any wish to
                            distinguish themselves either in arts or arms. From the remotest
                            antiquity down to the present day they have been hewers of wood and
                            drawers of water for others, and have made little or no progress; and
                            the only legitimate inference from this lengthened induction seems to be
                            that they are incapable of making it." [Brande's Ency. of
                            Science, Lit. and Art, p. 825.] But it needs not this eminent authority
                            to establish the inferiority of the negro; science, history, society,
                            his own independent efforts and common consent, all combine to pronounce
                            him inferior to the white race, socially, morally and
                            intellectually.</p>
                        <p>When the foundations of our government were laid, the negro occupied a
                            status in the country of established inferiority, which grew out of, and
                            was based upon, the recognized natural inferiority alluded to. He
                            existed here only in a state of slavery. This status of slave being
                            inconsistent with, and repugnant to, that of citizen, the presumption is
                            afforded that the framers of the Constitution of the United States did
                            not intend negroes to be included in the provisions contained in that
                            instrument relating to citizens. Indeed, some of the provisions of the
                            National Constitution indicate that the negro was to be excluded from
                            all participation in the political rights therein granted; or, if any
                            doubt of this could exist, the legislation of the first Congress under
                            that Constitution, (of which Congress many of the framers of that
                            instrument were members,) and subsequent legislation exhibits as a
                            cardinal principle, or idea, that this government was established for
                            the white race, and to the exclusion of the black race, or negro.</p>
                        <p>Looking at the constitution and legislation of our State, we find this
                            idea even more prominently indicated. The present State constitution, to
                            give it effect prohibited the immigration of negroes into the State. In
                            accordance with it we find the negro denied any and all privileges the
                            enjoyment of which might break down this distinction. Our State
                            legislation from the earliest period to the present time, in relation to
                            the subject contemplated by the bill, adapting itself to the idea
                            mentioned, has prohibited negro testimony in all cases where the
                            interests of the white race alone are involved. If doubts could be
                            entertained of our State legislation being adapted to the idea that this
                            is the white man's government, they must certainly yield to the
                            fact that in 1852 there was an omission in legislation upon the subject
                            of negro testimony, which omission the very next session of the
                            legislature hastened to supply.</p>
                        <p>From this brief glance at the history of our governments, both national
                            and State, we are drawn to the conclusionswhich conclusions can but
                            become irresistible upon a closer and fuller examination of that
                            historythat those governments are governments of the white race, and
                            that it was the design of their framers and legislators to erect an
                            insurpassable barrier between the black and white races. Most especially
                            do these conclusions apply to our State government. While it was
                            designed to allow the negro a certain restricted domicil within the
                            borders of our State, and privileges as between himself and his fellow
                            blacks, it was most certainly designed that he should not be allowed any
                            rights or privileges which would tend in the least to break down the
                            barrier placed between him and the white man by nature and by our
                            Constitution and laws recognized and sought to be upheld.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned can not but regard the bill in question as subversive of
                            this distinction, and therefore contrary to the spirit of our
                            government. It is but the camel's nose whose admission within the
                            window of civil rights and privileges we must prevent if we would retain
                            our own possession as our fathers intended. It is but the entering wedge
                            whose legitimate consequences must entail upon us all the evils of a
                            heterogeneous population; evils already too sadly illustrated tipon this
                            hemisphere; evils feared by our fathers, and by them zealously sought to
                            be guarded against. So long, then, as the principle indicated is to be
                            maintained, so long must the legislation contemplated by the bill under
                            consideration, be regarded as injudicious, impolitic and unwise.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, respectfully recommended that the bill lie upon the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to postpone the further consideration of the bill, and
                            make it the special order for next Thursday week, at 9 o'clock,A.
                            M.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. WILLIAMS, this motion was laid on the table, by yeas 19,
                            nays 18.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT spoke at length in favor of the passage of the bill. His
                            speech will appear in the Appendix.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY moved to amend the bill by adding to the first section the
                            following words:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Provided,</hi> That no person having one eighth or more of
                            negro blood, who has come or shall have come into this State in

                            carry the same into effect, shall be competent to testify in any case in
                            which a white person is a party in interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to postpone the bill and amendment till next
                            Tuesday at 9 o'clock, and make it the special order for that
                            hour.</p>

                            communication from the Acting Governor, in answer to a resolution of the

                            Department, in which he states that of the $7,000 contingent fund $2,000
                            has been expended; of the $5,000 telegraph fund, $2,500 has been

                            be'reduced from $7,000 to $3,500, the telegraph fund from $5,000 to
                            $2,500, and the clerk hire fund from $12,000 to $6,000, making an

                        <p>Mr. BEESON. This is a bill of great importance, and the sooner it becomes
                            a law the better it will be for all parties except the State Printer. As
                            I have not troubled the Senate much with many motions, I ask a
                            suspension of the rules that the bill may be read the third time

                        <p>On motion by Mr. THOMPSON his bill S. No. 212, to amend section 23 of An
                            Act for the Incorporation of Insurance Companies, etc. approved June 18,
                            1852; was read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN could not allow this bill to pass without entering his protest
                            against this kind of legislation. He recited the provisions of the
                            present law concerning Insurance Companies This bill proposes to strike
                            out of section 23 that portion which requires Insurance Companies to
                            deposit one half of their capital in the Auditor's office, and that
                            the balance be paid into the treasury of the corporation. The passage of
                            this bill would allow the companies up. on a deposit of $25,000 to
                            profess that they have fifty thousand or a million dollars capital. He
                            considered the law as it now stands a wholesome check and the only one
                            that can protect the community from frauds. This bill simply authorizes
                            these companies to go on and do business without giving the security the
                            law requires.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON made an earnest appeal in favor of home as against foreign
                            insurance companies; and insisted that our home companies should be
                            placed upon the same basis with foreign insurance companies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that there are two sides to this question, and it was
                            difficult for him to settle in his own mind what is a perfectly safe and
                            wise policy. He thought it would be our policy, if we can do it safely,
                            to encourage the building up of respondible insurance companies at home;
                            and it might be well to leave the door tolerably wide open to them. He
                            had concluded that he could vote for this bill, but not with entire
                            satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB could see no reason why home insurance companies should be
                            required to deposit $25,000 of stock for the purpose of securing to
                            persons insured their remedy under the law, when companies from a
                            distance and from other States are not required to do the same thing. It
                            is not the deposit that assures the insured, but it is the liability of
                            the stockholders and the amount of stock subscribed and paid in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD. If this bill is passed you give an opportunity for
                            irresponsible companies to be organized throughout the entire State; it
                            would open an avenue for every romantic individual who may desire to get
                            up an insurance company without capital, to prey and depredate upon the
                            public. He was opposed to this bill, and to the whole insurance system
                            as enacted by the law of 1852.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON moved to refer the bill to the <orgName>Committee on
                                Corporations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, was going to offer a few remarks in opposition to
                            the bill, but if there is a disposition to refer it, he would yield the
                            floor.</p>

                        <p>Mr RHODES called up bis motion to reconsider the vote by which Mr.
                            Newcomb's substitute was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr BROWN made an ineffectual motion to lay the motion to reconsider on
                            the table.</p>
                        <p>The House then refused to reconsider.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENDRICKS moved to recommit the bill, with instructions to
                            incorporate provisions similar to those described in his bill [H. R. No.
                            306] introduced this day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER Those instructions were simply a rehash of the substitute by
                            the Senator from Marion, which we have just voted down.</p>
                        <p>If there was merit or substance in anything proposed on this subject, it
                            was the bill of the gentleman from Elkhart.</p>
                        <p>Mr HENRICKS explained the instructions which he proposed.</p>
                        <p>Mr GRIFFITH. Does it not militate against the amendment of the gentleman
                            from Putnam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS. It throws part of the labor on the friends of
                            Temperance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH was opposed to leaving open the floodgates of vice for the
                            sake of expediency. He would do right regardless of questions of
                            political expediency. Without the great moral principle to which he
                            referred, we could never have got rid of slavery. He would have the
                            majority to govern in this matter of license. The motion to recommit was
                            hostile to the original bill and the amendment by the gentleman from
                            Putnam, (Mr. Lane.) He spoke generally to illustrate the importance of
                            the principle he had announced As between prohibition and license, he
                            was hardly prepared for prohibition - against sales for mechanical,
                            medicinal and sacramentals purposes. What is morally wrong could not be
                            legally right, and he did not want to see any question of political
                            expediency involved in the consideration of this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr SHUEY supposed that the bill was now in the least objectionable form.
                            It assumed the traffic wrong - evil, and only evil, and that
                            continually. Then it says, if a majority of the district are opposed to
                            the traffic, that settles the question against it. Were gentlemen afraid
                            of the people? The people had asked for the very terms of this bill in
                            numerous petitions. Neither he nor the Committee were tenacious as to
                            the form of the bill. He rather favored the provision by which the
                            commissioners shall not issue <pb n="153" xml:id="VAA8558-08-153"/>a
                            license where a majority remonstrated. He would fight it out on this
                            line, that a majority shall govern.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN was surprised to see the gentleman from Elkhart (Mr. Shuey)
                            yield the leading principle of his bill. Did the geatleman fear defeat?
                            It was better in the language of the gentleman from Montgemery (Mr.
                            Gregory) to sustain the right and trust to time for justification. It
                            had been better for the gentleman's reputation as a statesman if he
                            had maintained his original position. But he would leave the gentleman
                            in the bands of his enemies - his friends gave him up. The instructions
                            submitted by the gentleman from St. Joseph had their paternity from the
                            gentleman from Marion (Mr .Newcomb ) It came of the desire of that
                            gentleman to go to Congress. To the argument that it, was a Democratic
                            measure, he replied, that laws were for the protection of minorities.
                            Majorities could take care of themselves He illustrated the hardness
                            which this remonstrating clause would work against the rights of
                            retailers. As for the first ciaesof retailers, it was only a school for
                            crime. The drinker begins with his cider and beer, and ends in confirmed
                            inebriation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the previous question, but would yield for
                            explanation.</p>

                        <p>So the bill was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr BOYD asked to be excused from voting. He did not wish to com mitt
                            himself to the bill or against it. He could support the majority clause,
                            but he could not support the good moral character clause. The House
                            refused to excuse him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH and Mr. GROVES explained: They would vote against the bill,
                            because the present license law was better, and they regarded the
                            proposition of the gentleman from St. Joseph as a better bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr COWGILL would not vote for the passage of a law that he was not
                            satisfied would be beneficial to the State. He was satisfied that if the
                            party with which he was identified shall pass this bill, it will
                            endanger the success of that party at the next election.
                            ["That's honest."] His forty years political experience
                            abundantly established the fact, that the people will not sustain
                            anything like a prohibitory liquor law. If the Democratic party shall
                            get a majority in the next Legislature, he believed it would be a
                            greater evil to the country than any other which could befal it</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK had ever been opposed to anything looking to a prohibitory
                            liquor law. He made two speeches against the law of 1855. The gentleman
                            had said the passage of this bill would work the downfall of the
                            Republican party, but he warned that party of still more danger ahead in
                            the negro question. He never dodged a vote. He would vote for an
                            acceptable liquor bill, but not for this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB had become satisfied from experience in legislation, that no
                            law that proposed prohibition should ever be passed by one political
                            party. He had seen the maneuvering of his Democratic friends to bring us
                            to a square vote, and he was ready to vote squarely. Whenever they were
                            willing to unite for the furtherance of Temperance, he would go with
                            them; but he did not want to see his party take the burden alone. If
                            they could etand the law as it is, he could. He voted for the
                            prohibitory law ten years ago, which was overthrown, the Democratic
                            party taking ground and succeeding against it, and he said then that he
                            would not vote for another prohibitory law unless the Democrats also
                            supported it. He voted against this bill because he regarded it as
                            prohibitory. It would be a dead letter on the Statute book.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIMS The bill was regarded as unconstitutional. It would remain a
                            dead letter - just like the black laws.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ABBETT. The bill does not precisely meet my approbation. It is not
                            what I desire. Every principle of my nature revolts at the license
                            system. But having been an advocate of <pb n="154" xml:id="VAA8558-08-154"/> the cause of temperance my entire life,
                            upon the passage of this bill I cannot consistently vote against it;
                            because I think it will in some degree suppress intemperance. It is
                            believed by iny political opooneuts, that if this bill is passed it will
                            throw the balance of power in the State into the hands of the Democratic
                            party; and if there was no other consideration this side of Heaven that
                            would induce me to vote for this bill, it certainly would be that of
                            placing that party in power again.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. LASSELLE, COX, and HARRISON also explained, and Mr. RHOADS and Mr
                            GLEASON were prevented by objections.</p>
                        <p>So the bill was lost.</p>
                        <p>On the motion of Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, the House took a recess till 2

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM called up the special order, viz: The consideration of the
                            Joint Committee's bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H R No
                                285</ref>] to provide a State Debt Sinking Fund for the payment of
                            the War Loan bonds, and the five and the two-and-a-half per cent. State
                            Stocks therein named, etc.</p>
                        <p>It being on the second reading.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read through by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>[On motion by Mr. BROWN, Mr Pinney obtained leave of absence on account
                            of illness ]</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr BRANHAM, the House resolved into Committee of the Whole -
                            Mr. Henricks in the Chair - and took up the consideration of the State
                            Debt Sinking Fund bill just read.</p>
                        <p>The first section coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend by inserting appropriately a clause to this
                            effect: Together with all moneys derived from the sale of Public Works,
                            and all funds belonging to the State Debt Fund, and all the revenue
                            heretotore appropriated ro the State Debt Sinking Fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said the biil was homoge neous. The various provisions were
                            for the single object of paying the State Debt within some nine or ten
                            years; and it ought to be either supported or defeated as a whole. He
                            proceded to give his reasons for voting against, the bill, upon a motion
                            that the bill be reported back to the House with a recommendation that
                            it be rejected. The bill proposed a tax of fifteen cents on the $100 to
                            pay off the debt, including the War Loan Bonds, It was not a political -
                            a partisan measure. The tax-gatherer was no respector of persons. The
                            bill provides that the Auditor, Treasurer and Secretary of State
                            constitute a Board for this purpose. Was the debt now due on the fives
                            and two and a-half per cent. Bonds. If it were due, there was propriety
                            in paying it at once. But the Governor tells us that it is not, and the
                            two leading journals here tell us that it is not due. Without inquiring
                            further, he took this as an accepted fact for the argument, that if the
                            debt is not due, then we should make the best arrangement we can with
                            our creditors. There were then two considerations against the passage of
                            the bill. One was that the taxes were already too high. The people at
                            this time, in the short-crop localities, were in some cases actually
                            mortgaging their farms for tax money. The people of Indiana were
                            required to raise the enormous sum of $15,000,000 in taxes during the
                            present year. The other reason of opposition was, that one-fifth of the
                            property of the State of Indiana was exempt from taxation. If he was
                            right, this was a good reason for bis opposition.</p>
                        <p>He found that, there were seventy national banks, holding $14,000,000 of
                            national stocks. He was informed that the other deposits of these banks,
                            by the National Treasurer, was as high as one million, making
                            $15.000.000. And besides these, there were other stocks not taxable,
                            held by capitalists in the State that would swell this aggregate to $50
                            000,000 - these were the holders of "five-twenties,"
                            "seven-thirties" and "ten-forties " But in addition
                            to this, he showed, from the decision of the Supreme Court, in the case
                            of Whitney against the city of Madison, that all bank stock with a basis
                            of national stocks were exempt from taxation. Then there was on this
                            basis a circulation in the State of, say $50,000,000 more, and this made
                            the round sum of $100,000,000 exempt from taxation. He read from the act
                            of Congress to show this: greenbacks, national currency, etc., every
                            dollar in money, is exempt from taxation. Then comes the question: Is
                            there any propriety in providing by taxation to pay the State debt now,
                            when we can not call upon the capitalists of the State to pay a dollar
                            of it? Was it right, proper, fair or honest? He submitted that it was
                            not. He submitted further, that this state of things shall not always
                            exist. Congress may repeal, and allow the States to tax national stocks,
                            may retrace a step which they have taken in an unfortunate and unguarded
                            mo meat. Replying to the consideration that this act of of Congress was
                            right, that it was to obtain the needful means to carry on the war, he
                            alleged his opinion it would hive been as easy to draft the money of the
                            country as to draft the muscle and the life of the country. Money was
                            not more valuable than blood. He submitted the further consideration,
                            that the State's creditors had agreed to take the five and two and
                            a half per cent interest And this was about as high a rate as othe
                            investments pay. He instanced investments in agriculture. He submitted,
                            also, that the four thousand millions of debt of the Government of Great
                            Britain paid but three per cent interest So we could not pay this six
                            percent, rate of interestwe could not do it now, and if we could not pay
                            it now, in the present fancied, unusual tide of <pb n="155" xml:id="VAA8558-08-155"/> prosperity, we would be compelled
                            inevitably, and in a short time, he thought, to come down ourselves to a
                            rate of interest that could be paid, and this would then be repudiation
                            These were his reasons for opposition. We should not compel the laborers
                            and traders of the State to pay this interest, whilst the bankers and
                            capitalists were exempt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. The gentleman from Huntington was mistaken when he supposes
                            we intend to increase the taxes. The tax proposed by the friends of the
                            bill was precisely what it is now, - the only change being that the bill
                            sets apart a specific amount of the levy for a specific purpose. Every
                            member was aware that, in the adjust merit of the debt with the
                            State's creditors in 1846 and 1847, it was agreed to levy a tax of
                            twenty five cents on the-one hundred dollars on all the taxable property
                            of the State, and so much on every poll, till the interest and principal
                            of the debt should be paid. That was as much a part of the contract, as
                            that was by which the bond-holders surrendered half of the bonds. It
                            made no difference whether the debt is due in 1866, or 1876, or 1906, we
                            solemnly declare that the debt should be paid. And now what did this
                            bill propose? It proposed to do precisely what we then bound ourselves
                            by a solemn act of the legislature to do; and the man who votes against
                            the bill, votes not to fulfill that obligation.</p>
                        <p>It was true that we take the ground that the debt is not due in the sense
                            in which a note is due in bank; but it you fix upon the time when the
                            debt shall be paid, principal and interest, you determine the matter. We
                            propose now to do what the Legislature stipulated to do in 1864; and in
                            order to make it a little more explicit thm the "Butler bill,"
                            we set apart a specific amount - fifteen cents on the hundred dollars of
                            the levy.</p>
                        <p>He did not propose to enter into the discussion as to whether it was
                            right to tax Government bonds. He supposed this right is as old as
                            Governments themselves. Who could compare the condition of he State in
                            1845 with her condition now, and object to the provisions of this bill?
                            It proposed to tax no more than the Butler bill; and the tax was not so
                            much as the law makes it to-day.</p>
                        <p>Mr COFFROTH admitted that there was 25 cents on the hundred dollars for
                            State purposes; but there was no necessity to tax so high as that.</p>
                        <p>Mr BRANHAM said there was but 25 cents now levied for State purposes
                            proper - 15 cents set apart for the fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr COFFROTH admitted Mr. Branham'a statement in regard to the Butler
                            bill arrangement; but this went to the extent of an admission that the
                            State debt is now due. But the bill did not propose to pay till the end
                            of ten years.</p>
                        <p>Mr BRANHAM had introduced a similar bill in 1861, but it was overrode by
                            war. All the energies of the State were required to sustain the
                            Government, We propose, now the war is over, to go back where we began
                            and pay the debt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH There was no time from 1853 to 1861 in which we were not in
                            a better condition to pay this debt, than we are now. And he submitted
                            whether, at this time, we shall inaugurate a system of taxation to pay
                            this debt where one-fifth of the wealth of the State is exempt from the
                            levy?</p>
                        <p>The Committee rejected Mr. Coffroth's motion, affirmative 30,
                            negative 50; and the question recurred on Mr. Branham's
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the first section further by striking out
                            all that relates to the War Loan Bonds He showed that the War Loan Bouds
                            were coupon bonds, and required by the bill to be first paid. The five
                            percent bonds were given for half the canal debt, and the 2 1/2 per
                            cent, bonds were given for half the unpaid interest. The State having;
                            first come under this debt in 1846, it should be paid first. The War
                            Loan Bonds were issued under the act of May, 1861. But the act of June,
                            1861, set apart the moneys for State debt sinking fund purposes, and
                            pledged them for the payment of the new debt created by the War Loan
                            Bonds. He insisted that the Legislature had no right to make this
                            diversion of the Sinking Fund. He recognized the obligation to pay the
                            registered bonds first. He did not say that the issuance of the War Loan
                            Bonds was not right, but objected to paying them first, and to the
                            diversion of the Sinking Fund by the act of June, 1861. Therefore he
                            would strike out from the section all that relates to the War Loan
                            Bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM This was not a matter in which the Committee had any option.
                            The act of the Legislature of June 1861 was on record. He voted against
                            it; but the argument was that we were preserving the claims of creditors
                            whilst we preserved the Government. This was the reason of the act The
                            War Loan Bonds were taken by their holders upon the condition, that all
                            the available means of the State be pledged for their payment. There was
                            no estimating the amount of damage to the State credit by a failure of
                            this condition. If was on account of this neglige ce of State pledges
                            that the financial credit of the State was at so low an ebb.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB As he understood the Butler bill, it did not require a
                            Sinking Fund, but it did require 25 cents on the hundred dollars. The
                            operation of the motion of the gentleman from Monroe would be to provide
                            for the payment of 2 1/2 per cent, bonds, while on the 6 per cent half
                            the interest will continue to be paid. He was opposed to any shadow of
                            violation of a pledge made under the circumstances which created the War
                            Loan Bonds in 1861.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE referred to the emergency which created the War Loan Bonds, to
                            show their sacredness. The gentleman from Huntington underrated the
                            ability of the State. They could pay 15 cents now as easy as they could
                            have paid 7 cents a few years ago. The producers got twice as much for
                            their products.</p>
                        <p>Mr COFFROTH said the price of corn was about the same now as in 1851-52;
                            and the price of pork was downward Then the price of living was twice as
                            great as now, Then the people were not saddled with such immense public
                            debts - <pb n="156" xml:id="VAA8558-08-156"/> taxes for county, State
                            and national purposes He feared, from manifestations in the Committee,
                            that he was mistaken when he supposed the whip of partv bad not been
                            cracked over this bill. He showed further that those who took the war
                            bonds were parties to the State's wrong which pledged to them the
                            funds which were already pledged to our former creditors. He thought the
                            proposition of the gentleman from Monroe ought to be sustained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB There was too great an effort to accustom the public ear to
                            this craven cry, that the people cannot pay their taxes. Why linger? Why
                            pay our debts two or three times over in interest? We had already paid
                            this debt once and a half. He alleged that, with this bill and the
                            legislation now proposed, we would reduce instead of increasing the tax
                            For State purposes it was proposed to be 25 cents on the one hundred
                            dollars, and for all purposes it would not exceed 41 cents, - whereas it
                            was 80 cents under the present levy. He illustrated the folly of waiting
                            to pay this debt till the national stocks and issues of the Government
                            may be taxed, - when as the gentleman from Huntingdon himself says, the
                            Supreme Court, have decided that there is no power in the State that can
                            tax them. He would gladly exchange a few Government bonda in his
                            possession nt par for real estate. He expressed his confident belief
                            that our great national debt: would be paid. He showed that the income
                            of farms under the value of $10,000, or $20.000 were exempt from the
                            income tax. He made this statement in reply to the clamor that the labor
                            of the country paid all the taxes He also recited the taxes levied on
                            manufactures and imuorted articles Shoddy pays the heaviest tax here The
                            man of poor means does not buy so much dutiable goods as the rich man.
                            Farmers would be astounded to learn from the speech of the gentleman
                            from Huntington that they were an oppressed and bankrupt, class. If
                            people don't want to pay so much tax, let them get a cheaper
                            article. He did not doubt the people's ability to pay this debt,
                            contracted when some of us were boys. It would have been paid before
                            now, but for the action of our politicians. He gave way for - </p>

                            with petitions and other papers referred to this Committee, without

                        <p>Mr. VAWTER inquired when this Committee met.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN. At a time when the Senator met with them. The Committee, with
                            the exception of the Chairman, have agreed upon this report, and he as
                            Chairman has called no meeting. I informed him yesterday of the
                            intention of the Committee, so that he is not deceived or unadvised of
                            the course to be pursued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. On yesterday about this time I was notified that the
                            intention was to make this report. I staid here till Saturday evening,
                            and at no time were these bills placed in my possession. I have not been
                            requested by any member of the Committee to call them together, and to
                            my certain knowledge there has been no meeting of that committee since
                            the reference of <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_158">House bill 158</ref>.
                            I had a mind to let the matter pass, but there was an extraordinary
                            statement made here in my absence the other day. It was stated on the
                            floor of the Senate that a certain report I made was made under the
                            supervision of the officers of State; and the Senator made the statement
                            as he understood and believed it. Whether it was designed as a personal
                            reflection upon me, I do not know. I have just as profound a contempt
                            for any person who will make any such <pb n="157" xml:id="VAA8558-08-157"/> attempt, in my absence at least, as is
                            necessary. If it was designed as a compliment to the report, I might
                            take it as a compliment. That report was prepared at this table and
                            ghown to no person except the Senator from Lawrence. I make this
                            statement in vindication of myself. If that report is a true one I
                            desire to have the merit of it; if untrue, I am willing to take the
                            responsibility of it. He then raised a point of order that the report
                            was unparliamentary, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN. I will state to the Senator from Jennings the circumstances
                            under which the remarks were made, which I think will be satisfactory to
                            him unless he is a very unreasonable man, which I think he is pot. The
                            question came up in reference to calling on the Auditor of State for a
                            statement in reference to the condition of suits brought against
                            railroad companies. I stated I did not think it neccessary, because the
                            Senator's report embodied what I conceived to be the whole facts
                            connected with it. And I believed the Auditor was cognizant of the
                            facts, because I had seen the Senator in conversation with the Auditor.
                            My remarks were not made for the purpose of casting any reflection upon
                            any body.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER. The statement as made by the gentleman now is certainly
                            legitimate: but on yesterday, when I returned to the city, I found the
                            gentleman was reported a little different from that. There had been
                            nothing in the intercourse between the gentleman and myself that would
                            authorize a statement that the Auditor had prepared my report; and I
                            think if the statement was made it should be corrected. I am satisfied
                            that the statement now made by the gentleman is legitimate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN then spoke to the point of order, contending that it was not
                            well grounded.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. WILLIAMS, NILES and VAWTER sustained the point of order in a few
                            remarks.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER decided the point of order not well taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER appealed from the decision of the Chair, in the following

                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the House, according to previous order,
                            resolved into Committee of the Whole - Mr. Henricks in the Chair - and
                            resumed the consideration of the Joint Committees State Debt Sinking
                            Fund bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>,] - the
                            question being on the amendment of Mr. Buskirk, proposing to amend the
                            first section by striking out all that relates to the war loan
                            bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB being entitled to the floor yielded it for the present.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK did not propose to go into a discussion of the merits of the
                            bill. He deprecated political questions in this connection. Gentlemen
                            were mistaken in supposing either that he was finding fault with the
                            Legislature of 1861 authorizing the war loan bonds, or that he was
                            opposed to paying them. But he denied the authority of the Legislature
                            to make the diversion of the State debt funds, and he was opposed to
                            taxing the people at such a time as this to pay bonds which have 17
                            years to run. The gentleman from Jefferson had told us correctly
                            yesterday, that the financial credit of the State was bad because it had
                            broken faith with creditors. There was a violation of plighted faith by
                            the Legislature of 1861, pledging the Sinking Fund for '61,
                            '62, and '63 to pay the war loan. But the Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners had expended two-thirds of a million in the purchase of
                            State bonds mostly five and two and a half per cents., and not to the
                            redemption of the war loan bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Did the act of 1861 direct that the fund should be so
                            applied? The first levy for 1861 did not belong to the sinking fund. If
                            the war loan bonds could not be got at par, they did not violate the act
                            of 1861.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The gentleman had stated that the act of June, 1861, was a
                            useless act. There was no necessity for it. These war bonds
                            ($2,000,000,) were for the benefit of the Federal Government, and that
                            Government is bound to pay them. The Federal Government had paid what
                            had been redeemed - over one million. He thought we would be discharging
                            our duty to give the Federal Government opportunity to pay the balance
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's amendment was rejected affirmative 30, negative
                            43.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER proposed to amend the first section by adding after the word
                            "State," in the 20th line, this: "and 50 cents on each
                            taxable poll."</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS. If he understood the bill, it does not levy this 15 cents on
                            the hundred dollars, but merely sets apart that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. This amendment would compel shoddy to pay something.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM hoped the bill would regain without this. There would be a
                            sufficient poll tax for State purposes authorized in another bill.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend in the 5th section, after the word
                            "shall," insert this:"endorse on the back of the
                            certificate the amount paid thereon, and the balance unpaid, and
                            immediately forward."</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM and Mr. DUNHAM suggested clerical amendments which were
                            agreed to.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the Committee now rose and the Chairman
                            reported the bill to the House recommending the adoption of the
                            amendments of the Committee of the Whole, and that so amended, the bill
                            do pass.</p>
                        <p>The Clerk read the amendment by the Committee by the Whole to the first
                            section in line 22, adding this: "and together with all moneys in
                            the State Treasury belonging to said fund, derivable from the general
                            fund, and the revenues derived from the State Debt Sinking
                            Fund."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the amendment by adding his exemption of
                            the war loan bonds.It was rejected - yeas 29, nays 58.</p>
                        <p>The Committee's amendment was then adopted.</p>
                        <p>The further amendments to sections 5 and 9 recommended by the Committee
                            were also adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM moved that the bill be considered engrossed and read the
                            third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH submitted a question of order that the bill could not be
                            advanced by this motion, because the bill is not the special order for
                            the day; and that the bill goes to its place in the calendar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) resisted the point of order, by
                            the consideration that the Committee of the Whole had recommended that
                            the bill be the special order for 10 o'clock to-day, and that that
                            recommendation was concurred in and became the resolution of the
                            House.</p>
                        <p>But on consulting the journal, and on further debate by Mr. BROWN and Mr.
                            DUNHAM - </p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT acquiesced so far as, that this point of order would be well
                            taken on the question of the third reading.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the chair) held that the motion of Mr.
                            Branham could be entertained so far as to order the engrossment; and
                            that debate on the merits of the bill is in order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM modified his motion so as to order the engrossment and make
                            the bill the special order for Friday at 10 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT desired to notice some few things that had arisen in the
                            debate. The principal matter was the objections of the gentleman from
                            Huntington. He was in favor of the bill because the public debt was not
                            legally due as an obligation of the State. The gentleman from Huntington
                            himself seemed ia doubt as to this point. He considered the method and
                            the history of this State debt arrangement.</p>
                        <p>It commenced in 1844, and was not completed till 1846. He noted the
                            caution and deliberation with which negotiations were made between the
                            bondholders and the State, and it was hardly possible that the language
                            they used was not precisely what was intended. That language was -
                            payable at the pleasure of the State at the end of twenty years. Until
                            that twenty years had expired the State has no right to require its
                            creditors to receive their <pb n="162" xml:id="VAA8558-08-162"/> pay. If
                            that debt becomes positively due on the 19th day of January, 1866, what
                            becomes of that clause, "at the pleasure of the State?" It was
                            legal language, susceptable of but one legal import.</p>
                        <p>The message of Governor Whitcomb, the report of committees in 1846, and
                            1847, were appealed to, to justify his conclusion. It was
                            contemporaneous construction that the State would make these bonds a
                            perpetual annuity depending upon the ability and the will of the State
                            when they should be paid. They were made to stand upon the State's
                            honor and conform to her ability and will to pay them after the
                            expiration of the 20 years, and the measure of duty was the ability of
                            the State. Instead of informing us when this debt is due and payable,
                            these objectors merely referred to the fact that taxation is running up,
                            and that one-fifth of the property of the State is exempt from taxation.
                            But if the question of duty is governed by abilitythe question of the
                            State's; ability is the only question before us. The grand levy was
                            upon 516,000,000 of property.He understood Mr. Coffroth to allege that
                            one-fifth of this, ($100,000,000,) was exempt from taxation. He examined
                            the items which made up this sum in the statement of Mr. Coffroth. He
                            did not believe there were fourteen millions of stock of the United
                            States held by the National Banks in the State. On the distribution of
                            the first hundred and fifty millions, the share of the State would not
                            exceed six or seven millions. The storage of the capital of the seventy
                            National Banks in the State would not exceed $$125,000.Mr. COFFROTH said
                            the bonds of these banks and their stocks were the same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. That was a just admission. He read from the National Banking
                            act to show that the stocks of the State are legitimately taxable
                            capital - that the real property and the shares of these National banks
                            shall be taxed. He was not denying that the bonds were not subject to
                            taxation; but he showed now these bonds in the banks were charged with
                            tax as shares. Deposits were taxed as the property of depositors.But the
                            gentleman from Huntington says all U. S. currency is exempt from
                            taxation. He read the 18th section of the Act of Congress, (read also by
                            the gentleman from Huntington,) to show the meaning of the words,
                            "obligation or other security of the United States" - reading
                            also in other sections of the act, to show that where in the 13th
                            section it is declared that this clause shall mean postal currency,
                            etc., it means that when these description of currency were
                            counterfeited, the guilty party shall be a felon, and punished as such.
                            The currency of the U. S. was not a prommissory note, but money, and
                            taxable as gold. He referred also to the act of Congress of 1865,
                            reading the first section, and the second section of the act before
                            referred to, to ascertain what notes are exempt from taxation by State
                            and municipal authorities. These notes were "seven
                            -thirties."</p>
                        <p>The Federal law says although the bonds may not be taxed, yet the bank
                            shares shall be. He avoided discussion of the inducing motives which led
                            to this exemption from taxation. It did not come gracefully for those to
                            complain of our public burthens, when it was remembered, that, but for
                            their lack of zeal in the support of the Government, we should have had
                            no war, and no public debt. He closed by alleging his opinion that the
                            levy proposed in the bill would accomplish the end desired by the
                            Committee. All classes of levies in any county in the State could not
                            anywhere exceed 300 cents on the hundred dollars. The second sec. of the
                            County Debt act of last session put a limit to the amount of levy and
                            assessment - sufficient to pay at least one-fourth the amount of such
                            legalized bonds in each of the years of 1865, 1866,1867, and 1868. Now
                            let us say, if the people have ability a part of the levy shall be
                            applied to the extinction of this oldest of our public debts at the
                            earliest possible day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH took the floor, but gave way for a motion to adjourn.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. GRIFFITH, the House took a recess till two o'clock

                        <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN, his Locomotive Engineer bill, [H. R. 301], a
                            special order for this hour, was taken up and read the second time by
                            the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN, sundry clerical errors were corrected, and it was
                            further amended by reducing twenty days notice to ten days; also, in the
                            10th section, inserting this: "Or in the Circuit Court or Court of
                            Common Pleas in this State in any county through which the road
                            passes." [Examiners' compensation in fees ($10) for
                            license.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM desired an amendment that drunkenness disqualifies an
                            engineer absolutely - to come into the fifth section: and that no person
                            be licensed who becomes intoxicated by spirituous liquors;" which
                            was adopted.</p>
                        <p>On the motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, (the constitutional restriction being
                            suspended for the purpose,) the bill was considered as engrossed,
                            ordered to the third reading, and read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM suggested, that hardships would work in the case of a
                            division of opinion between the two examiners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. The applicant would not be licensed in such a case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM also objected to the sixth section. It was loose in its
                            construction, inflicting a penalty where an unlicensed person
                            "attempts to run a locomotive." It was a provision that could
                            not be enforced. There were numerous instances in which firemen have to
                            move engines into or out of the yard, or in case of approaching
                            trains.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM stated the case of the killing of a child lately in New Albany
                            by a fireman switching a train after the train had been brought into the
                            depot. He thought well of the bill. The legal import of the word
                            "attempt," was well enough understood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH asked unanimous consent to move to strike out the words
                            "or attempt to perform."</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER objected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY objected to that portion of the bill which fixes a penalty of
                            $500 for employing an engineer in violation of this act - reaching to
                            the individual property of each and every <pb n="163" xml:id="VAA8558-08-163"/>owner or stockholders. He was willing to
                            subject to the penalty the property of those directly in the management
                            by which the violation of law is made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said, no good lawyer would hold that the individual in the
                            firm who has suffered in damages from the act of the firm has not his
                            remedy in an action against other members of the firm for their pro rata
                            share of the damage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY moved to recommit the bill, with instructions to strike out
                            that provision which makes the individual property of stockholder
                            liable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN spoke generally in opposition to the motion, replying to
                            objections and supporting the provisions of the bill requiring liability
                            of stockholders.</p>
                        <p>After further debate Mr. NEWCOMB showing that we can't give any part
                            of the penalty to the informer: and Mr. OLLEMAN objecting to the fee of
                            $10. It was too high: and Mr. DURHAM suggesting an amendment to meet the
                            objection of the gentleman from Jefferson (Mr. Branham) adding
                            appropriately this: "Or a person regularly indentured to learn the
                            skill, science or duty of an engineer, and under the immediate
                            superintendence or control of the engineer.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, (Mr. Shuey's motion being withdrawn) the
                            further consideration of the bill was postponed, and it was made the
                            special order for Friday morning 10 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THACHER submitted an order, which was adopted, reciting Thanksgiving
                            to-morrow by proclamation of the President, etc., and resolving that
                            when this House adjourns today it shall be till Friday next at 9
                            o'clock A. M.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, it was ordered that the Speaker appoint a

                        <p>On the motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the House now resumed the consideration of
                            the Joint Committee's State Debt Sinking Fund bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>] - the question being on
                            Mr. Branham's motion for the engrossment, and to make the bill the
                            special order for Friday 10 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Higgins (by unanimous consent) presented the memorial of Milton
                            Mercer, of Goshen, G. H. Wells and J. S. Beach, of Terre Haute, Wm. D.
                            Allen, of Greencastle, and John Galloway, of Cambridge City,
                            representing that they are owners of half a million of the two and a
                            half per cent. bonds of the State - that they purchased them, paying 60
                            to 70 per cent, for them twelve years ago, with full knowledge of the
                            facts and the law in the case, believing that they would be redeemed on
                            the 19th of January, 1866. They ask such legislation as may provide for
                            the payment of these bonds according to the ability of the State.</p>
                        <p>The memorial was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then ordered to the engrossment and made the special order

                        <p>On motion by Mr. Newcomb, Mr. Foulke's bill [H. R, 25] to repeal the
                            act to prohibit the evidence of Indians and persons having one-eighth
                            negro blood in all cases where white persons are parties in interest,
                            approved February 4, 1853; and so much of all other laws as renders
                            persons incompetent as witnesses in courts of law - the question being
                            on the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved to recommit the bill with instructions to add this:
                            "Provided that the privileges granted by this act shall not extend
                            to and embrace, or be enjoyed by any negro or mulatto who has come into
                            the State since the adoption of the present Constitution."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK submitted two reasons for his amendment. The resident negroes
                            were constitutional negroes and better qualified to remain. The second
                            was, because he would offer no immunity to those persons violating the
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. The object of the bill was to get at the truth in courts of
                            Justice. There were negroes whose testimony would be taken as readily as
                            any white man's. Not very long ago we had a statute disqualifying a
                            man for testifying who has been guilty of any infamous crime. Other
                            States had disqualified those who disbelieve in future retributions. But
                            all these things were done away.</p>
                        <p>Our statutes provided that no man shall be disqualified from testifying
                            on account of crime. Then why, on account of color? This bill proposes
                            to admit the Indian and negro to testify, no more for the benefit of the
                            negro than for parties in interest. We have a Constitution which says
                            that no special law shall regulate practice in the Courts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Exclusion of a class was not special legislation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. The gentleman was mistaken. If the gentleman believes we may
                            exclude a class, would it not be competent to exclude Democrats as a
                            class? He gave other considerations in opposition to the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS would not vote for the amendment. He understood that it
                            admitted all negroes to testify who resided in the State at the time of
                            the adoption of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Were not those old resident negroes con stitutional negroes
                            ? [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL saw no propriety in the amendment. It was all humbug.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and the
                            main question was ordered, viz: Shall the bill be referred with Mr.
                            Buskirk's instructions?</p>
                        <p>The motion was rejected - yeas 19, nays 70 and the question recurred on
                            its final passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said the gentleman from Marion had agreed to pair off with
                            him in debate on this question. Notwithstanding that gentleman had
                            almost violated the agreement, still he was not yet disposed to debate,
                            and would deemand the previous question on the passage of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Under the operation of this demand, the bill was passed the final reading
                            in the House of Representatives - yeas 55, nays 35 - as follows:</p>

                            approved March 2, 1855 [containing additional provisions in regard to

                        <p>Mr. D. stated that under the old law which was made for the accommodation
                            of Perry county, it was almost impossible to verify the voters. This
                            bill takes the number of the votes cast at the last annual election,
                            with a small per cent, added - two-thirds of these shall be sufficient
                            with the other conditions, to order the relocation - and the person

                        <p>Mr. WOOD, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>, returned
                            Mr. Thompson's bill, S. 212, to amend section 23 of An Act to
                            incorporate Insurance Companies, approved June 17,1852; recommending its
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON urged the passage of his bill, it having already been read
                            three times. Foreign Insurance Companies are now taking from the State a
                            large revenue, which should be retained here, and would be if our home
                            Companies were put on the same footing with those of other States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN did not oppose the bill merely for the purpose of opposition;
                            but would remind the Senate again of the points made against the bill
                            when it was up before. The bill leaves no protection for the insuring
                            public, and is an unsafe measure. It is the duty of the General Assembly
                            to legislate for the people, and not for capitalists and moneyed
                            monopolists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON thought the Senator was attempting to drive all home
                            Companies out of existence. The present law requires Insurance Companies
                            to keep on deposit, at the State Auditor's office, $25,000, and
                            that is sufficient; - it is hardly probable that any one loss would
                            amount to more than that; - while foreign Companies are not required to
                            deposit a dollar. Beside, our Companies are required to pay ten per
                            cent, damage for unnecessary delay in paying losses justly due. He
                            insisted there is nothing wrong about this bill, and hoped it would
                            pass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-nine senators seconded the demand, and under its operation the
                            bill finally passed the Senate by yeas 29, nays 15.</p>

                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that he was not entirely satisfied with the provisions
                            of the bill, and It will be remembered that he made efforts to have it
                            amended. But he had so strong a desire to see the Sinking Fund, and all
                            our other trust funds invested in our public debt, that he had
                            concluded, as a choice of evils, to vote for the bill as it is, rather
                            than to incur the risk of delay and the danger of having the fund
                            distributed to the counties. He had confidence in the Commissioners of
                            the Sinking Fund, and he believed they would honorably invest the funds
                            in our State bonds. Their acts can not be done in a corner, but will be
                            patent to all the people of the State. If they act corruptly, they will
                            deserve to have "thief" branded on their foreheads, and their
                            names will go down to their children like those of condemned felons.
                            With such sanctions he was prepared to take the risks of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON had his hopes and his heart set upon the idea that in a few
                            short months the State of Indiana would be owing only about $3,300,000.
                            Our State debt is upwards of $6,036,000. The amount of the State debt
                            sinking fund is about $1,000,000. In the hands of the Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners, is $600,000. There is also due this fund $900,000,
                            secured by mortgages, which can be made available to the State by the
                            issuing of six per cent, bonds, made payable when the mortgages are
                            collected. Putting all these sums together, and applying it on the
                            public debt, and it would have about $3,300,000. If we could have these
                            funds invested in the State bonds, and the State debt reduced to this
                            sum, it would be the best advertisement we could send to the
                            World's Fair. And it is the act of the Republican party if this is
                            not done, and you will have to answer to the people. The Republican
                            party have the power, from the fact that we stand here 25, and enough of
                            the opposite party are with us to secure this object. We are the party
                            in power, and this reflection is upon ourselves, and not upon the
                            Democratic party.</p>
                        <p>If these funds shall be squandered, the expectation of the Governor and
                            the hopes of the people will be defeated in this war for money makingand
                            the Republican party are responsible for it. This bill was conceived,
                            brought forth and nourished in the House, and it takes from our children
                            their education money, covenanted to them by our fathers.</p>
                        <p>Without reading the bill, a vote was taken on its passage resulting: -

                            reciting the course of this bill through the last session. The
                            appraisement which would be made under the first section of this bill
                            would not give a fair appraisement of the railroad property of Indiana.
                            Under this bill Indiana would have no railroad taxation, and would
                            collect no taxes from railroads whatever. No railroad appraisement ever
                            yet made in Indiana has been permitted to stand by any railroad as an
                            entirety. One of the objects of this bill is to legalize the
                            appraisement made by a board of equalization which did what they had no
                            right to do; and this is one of the reasons for his opposition to the
                            bill. He entered into a detailed history of railroad assessments made in
                            this State, extending his remarks beyond the usual hour of adjournment,

                            State Debt Sinking Fund bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R.
                                285</ref>], was taken up - the question being on the final passage
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH, being entitled to the floor, reviewed Mr. Pettit's
                            construction of the acts of Congrees exempting stocks from taxation. He
                            regretted that Mr. P. was not in his place. He first submitted the
                            objection to the bill in section 4, where it is provided that after
                            paying the interest on all the debts including the war debt, of the
                            remainder, 70 per cent, goes towards liquidation of the 5 per cents.,
                            and 30 per cent, towards the 2 1/2 per cents. Now the 2 1/2's rate
                            at about 80 cents on the dollar. The 5's are about par. It was
                            probable that these both would go down to half par. But we don't
                            buy them at the market value, but buy their face. If they they should
                            run down to 50 cents it was plain that the loss to the State would be
                            just half the debt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Would't we make more money by repudiating the whole
                            debt?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH could not see the point of the suggestion. All States buy up
                            their bonds at their market value.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. Suppose we make such legislation as will reduce them to ten
                            cents on the hundred dollars?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH did not understand that their value could be controlled by
                            legislation. He then proceeded to show, that whether the debt be due or
                            not, the bill is wrong. If the debt be due, the bill does not provide
                            adequately for its payment; and if it be hot due, the people are not in
                            a condition to be taxed for its payment. Never was there a worse time
                            for taxation. The Federal and State and local taxes were enormous.
                            Especially was it not the time to tax for this purpose, when one-fifth
                            or one-sixth of the entire amount of the taxable property of the State
                            is exempt from taxation.</p>
                        <p>He argued that if the words "at the pleasure of the State" were
                            to be taken as meaning that the debt is not due, it might never be due.
                            The current history of our legislation went to show that the debt is now
                            due in point of time. But these conclusions were useless; because,
                            whether due or not, the bill is wrong.</p>
                        <p>He came then to consider whether we should tax now to pay the State debt.
                            He complained that the majority had determined, in caucus, to support
                            this bill before it was considered in the House - before the
                            considerations were presented for the information of our judgment. It
                            was really not at all a party question. The minority had voted as a unit
                            against because it was manifestly wrong.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH knew of no caucus on the subject: but it was sufficient to
                            command his vote, that the Democrats were against it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH was not controlled by any such consideration. The gentleman
                            was not at the caucus: he may have been at the Theater. But if the bill
                            passes here, we will take the question to a forum where there can be no
                            predetermination - the forum of the people.</p>
                        <p>He submitted whether it was right that the whole of this State Debt
                            burden be taken from the capitalists and placed on the shoulders of the
                            labor of the State. He then replied in detail to the argument of Mr.
                            Speaker Pettit, submitting statements in figures which can not be justty
                            sketched, and would exceed our space. He summed up the capital of the
                            seventy national banks in the State. In this, the Sixth Congressional
                            District, these banks had a capital of about three millions, - which he
                            thought would embrace about one-fifth of the National Banking capital in
                            the State, and that would give the grand total in the State of about
                            fifteen millions.</p>
                        <p>He got his estimates from one of our most intelligent National Bank
                            Presidents. He had made his estimate of this total at $14,000,000, and
                            the Government deposits with these banks at $1,000,000, including, also,
                            the U. S. securities held by the Free Banks. Then, $35,000,000 of
                            Government stocks were held by the people. Then, the circulation -
                            Treasury notes and National currency - in the loyal States he estimated
                            in round numbers at $1,000,000,000. This would give to Indiana for her
                            share, say 150,000,000 - Indiana being an average State. So his estimate
                            of $100,000,000 exempt from taxation was exceeded by the sum of
                            estimates just recited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. The gentleman counts it twice - the bonds and the currency.
                            The circulation emanates from the capital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Not at allor if so, it was proper; because the bonds were
                            held by the banks - the currency by the people. The capital was taxed
                            against - the banks, the circulation against the people.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to the allegation of Mr. Speaker Pettit, that the stocks
                            of these banks are subject to taxation. But not a dollar of it was on
                            the duplicate; not a stockholder pays a dollar of tax on his stock, so
                            far as he knew. The gentleman says deposits are taxed in the hands of
                            depositors. But a deposit was a special loan. In the case of
                            individuals, the <pb n="169" xml:id="VAA8558-08-169"/> holder of the
                            deposit and the holder of the note therefor were both taxed. It was not
                            so in the case of these national banks holding deposits of the people;
                            because (as he showed) the deposits were greenbacks. He referred to the
                            decision in the case of Widtney against the city of Madison - November
                            term of the Supreme Court, 1864 - p. 331, to the effect, that bank stock
                            and stock of the United States held as bank capital, are not
                            taxable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL asserted that this decision was under an act of Congress
                            passed prior to that read by Mr. Pettit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH replied that Mr. Pettit read from the act of June 3, 1864,
                            and this decision was in November of the same year. The Court places it
                            upon constitutional grounds - then taxation is prohibited by the
                            constitution, and not by virtue of any act of Congress. The Supreme
                            Court had made this decision, and, rteht or wrong, it was a rule unto
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. The act of Congress provides that the shares may be
                            taxed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The statute simply says, page 112 of the statutes at large
                            of 1863-64, that they may be taxed if the State or municipal authorities
                            have the authority so to do simply throwing the question back upon the
                            constitution. So he answered Mr. Pettit as to this. He then replied to
                            Mr. P.' s allegation, that greenbacks are taxable as money. He
                            showed from the act of Congress that reenbacks were treasury notes; and
                            that "all bonds, treasury notes, and other securities of the United
                            States" shall be exempt from taxation. He read further from the act
                            to the same effect, that all currency including coupons and stamps,
                            shall be exempt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. Would it have made any difference if this provision of the
                            act had not been passed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Perhaps not so far as bonds are concerned. It was a
                            decision by Judge Marshall, who was constantly disposed to favor the
                            central power. The only appeal from this hardship was to the people. So
                            far as the national currency was concerned, there would be a clear right
                            to tax that, were it not for this act of Congress; and notwithstanding
                            that act, he still regarded it as an open question, that national
                            currency could be taxed by State or municipal authority. The act of 1865
                            did not militate against the act of 1864. If a more injurious and
                            infernal way of defrauding the people were desirable, or which would be
                            more fruitful of revenue to the privileged class, it could not have been
                            devised better than this system, the creature of that political
                            charletan, Salmon P. Chase. Capitalists make from 35 and 40 to 50 per
                            cent, annually on their investments in these national banks. No national
                            bank was making less than 35 per cent, per annum.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the hopefulness of Mr. P. that the people will still endure
                            taxation, because they had endured a tax of 300 cents on the hundred
                            dollars, he said, it was like the practice of Dr. Sangrador - warm water
                            and bleed, and bleeding and warm water till the patient dies.</p>
                        <p>The County Commissioners were not restricted from levying the whole
                            amount of the local county tax in one year, as the gentleman from Wabash
                            had said. With reference to the gentleman's allegation, that we
                            would have had no troubles and no debt if the party of the minority here
                            had been true to the flag, he would say nothing, but admit that the
                            gentleman himself did take military service as Colonel of the 75th
                            regiment; and when the regimen marched to the field the gentleman
                            marched home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL denied that Mr. P., his colleague, ever accepted a
                            Colonel's commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The gentleman from Wabash was commandant of the post, but
                            he insisted upon nothing about that, only he thought it an ungenerous
                            fling at the party, and that it came with a bad grace from the
                            gentleman, in the face of those of the minority on this floor, [Mr.
                            Milroy and others,] who had served in the Held as well.</p>
                        <p>The House then took a recess till 2 o'clock P. M.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN" (being entitled to the floor,) addressed the House at
                            length against the bill. [The speech is reserved for correction.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. As he understood the question raised but the objectors to the
                            bill, it was this: Should the payment of the public debt be provided for
                            at this time, when $100,000,000 of Government bonds are in the hands of
                            a portion of the people not subject to taxation? There was a vast
                            difference in the estimates of the gentleman from Huntington and the
                            gentleman from Wabash, as to the amount of these bonds exempted. Whether
                            the one or the other was right, it made no difference with respect to
                            the main question here; in either case, it was still right to adjust the
                            State debt. He justified this exemption of bonds from taxation. It
                            obtained money at par to carry on the war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. What was the difference between the right to draft for
                            money, and to draft for blood?</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. The Government got both men and money when they wanted them -
                            got money and secured the draft. The same cry of opposition would have
                            gone up against the draft for money as was heard in certain quarters
                            against the draft for men. He showed that it was absolutely necessary to
                            exempt the bonds from taxation, in order to get the money. Otherwise the
                            city of New York would have reduced the Government bonds twenty per
                            cent. Then, if they were not protected, unfriendly legislation would tax
                            these bodds so as to drive them out of existence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. But assessments for taxation must be uniform.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. Taxation could not be uniform - the rate could not be uniform
                            either in the cities of the State, or in the different States of the
                            Union. To tax these bonds was a little like taxing money in the pocket.
                            The General Government, a sovereign, should not be taxed by the
                            municipality - nor should the General <pb n="170" xml:id="VAA8558-08-170"/> Government be overrode by the States. It
                            was the old secession heresy of State Rights. This States Rights
                            taxation would place the General Government in the power of unfriendly
                            States. It was not necessary to say that at the time those bonds were
                            offered, the Ship of State was well nigh foundered, the hissing cry came
                            up from the Sons of Liberty: "Not a dollar, not a man to carry on
                            this unholy war." They said these bonds were not worth the paper;
                            and gentlemen to-day were trying lo make that declaration good. How were
                            these bonds distributed? They were divided among the people without
                            respect to any favored class. This appealing to the prejudice of
                            laborers against capitalists would not avail. Governor Willard - that
                            best of Democratic tacticians - said, this was the reason why the
                            Democracy always succeeded: they appealed not to the prejudices, but
                            only to the patriotism of the people. The right to tax these bonds was
                            founded in principle as deep as the foundations of the Government
                            itself. This tenacity of sovereignty was the foundation stone of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Was the gentleman in favor of the General Government taxing
                            their bonds?</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. He was for the General Government doing just what they are
                            doing with them. Gentlemen held as much wild land as they pleased
                            without taxation by the General Government. Without these bonds, the
                            national debt could not be funded at less than 8 per cent. It would not
                            take as large a per cent. of the property in the country to pay off the
                            entire national debt, as it would to fund these bonds. When he had
                            concluded - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNMAM took the floor and spoke an hour in opposition to the bill.
                            [His speech is reserved for authentication. It will be printed
                            hereafter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said it might surprise his friend from Floyd if he were to
                            announce that the question before us was the adjustment of our State
                            debt. He was disappointed at seeing gentlemen indulge in these
                            diversions in this debate. The gentleman from Huntington rejects this
                            bill, but fails to propose any adjustment of the debt in its place. He
                            gave way for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, who moved for a night session at 7 o'clock -
                            affirmative 34, negative 30 - no quorum voting. The motion was then
                            withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY proceeded. He replied to Mr. Coffroth's allegation, that
                            the State would lose $600,000 by paying the public debt, as the bill
                            proposes, at par value. Would not the gentleman be making a pretty
                            figure for the State, buying up its own bonds at a shave. Such a thing
                            would be dishonorable in an individual, much more in a great State. The
                            gentleman would have the State's creditors wait till the Democratic
                            party shall get power again. He trusted that day would never come. Would
                            the gentleman repudiate the debt of the nation? There was no Taney nor
                            Perkins to sustain him in such a course. He remembered in that day of
                            trial when the Government offered these bonds, some of the stump
                            speeches of Democrats alleging that greenbacks were worthless and the
                            Government stocks would turn out as valueless as the old Continental
                            currency. And in this way it was by these speeches on every Democratic
                            lip and tonguethat the Government was compelled to resort to exemption
                            of the bonds from taxation. It was a child of their own begetting.</p>
                        <p>To a genuine Union man the burden of taxation was not onerous. He
                            complains not, because he regards what has been procured by these
                            national obligations. He was not at all alarmed at the gentleman's
                            determination to take this issue before the people - to cry aloud and
                            spare not: and he thought he appreciated the influence he and his party
                            might command. He recited what the bill proposes. It was but a return to
                            the original contract and engagement of the State in 1846. But, if he
                            could have had his way, he would have put the bill in such a shape as to
                            pay, first the 2 1/2 per cents then he would have paid the five per
                            cents.; and then the sixes - the war bonds. But still he thought the
                            bill was the best bill for this adjustment that was likely to come
                            before the General Assembly this session, and therefore he should
                            support it with his vote.</p>

                            for $65 70, and I think there is no doubt, from what I hear, that it is

                            it unnecessary to make two districts out of one, which is but an average
                            district; and recommending that the bill be indefinitely postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN stated that he was informed by the Senator from Rush, that the

                        <p>Mr. STEWART said that district was composed of the counties of Decatur,
                            Rush, Hancock, Henry and Madison. Rush and Decatur lie south of the
                            National Road. It was a long; narrow district. The two counties below
                            the National Road, (Rush and Decatur,) wish to be formed into a District
                            by themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS had information from the Judge, that he is entirely unable to

                        <p>The SPEAKER. That could not be done without unanimous consent. The bill

                        <p>After further conversation by Messrs. BOYD, BUSKIRK, CHAMBERS and
                            MILLER,</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS had leave to withdraw the report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART, from the <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>,
                            obtained unanimous consent to return Mr. Cox's bill, H. R. No. 217,
                            to compel Railroad Companies to transport all freight, of whatever
                            nature, and declaring that one class of freight shall not have
                            precedence over another class; recommending that it be indefinitely
                            postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS trusted that the House would not sustain the recommendation. He
                            knew than local freight was neglected for through freight. It was not
                            particularly the design of the bill to compel the roads to take
                            perishable freight, but to protect the rights of the people of the State
                            against the power of a growing monopoly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART said the bill was reported to elicit information. Such a law
                            as this bill provides would seem to be correct; but it was found on
                            maturely reflecting, that it would work hardships and injustice to some
                            of the roads. The fact that up to the commencement; of the war, but few,
                            if any, of the railroads in the State paid the actual expenses of
                            operating them, was sufficient to account for the meagre supply of
                            rolling stock on the various roads.</p>
                        <p>With the increase of business on the different roads came a corresponding
                            increase in the price of everything pertaining to their operation.
                            Locomotives costing, before the war, from $8,000 to $9,000, cannot now
                            be had for less than $18,000 to $20,000; and freight cars cost in the
                            same proportion. Many of the roads have been deterred from purchasing,
                            on account of the excessively high prices, and have been waiting in hope
                            of a reduction. He was informed by the managers of several of the most
                            important roads in the State, that they are taking steps to thoroughly
                            equip their roads with a sufficient amount of rolling stock to enable
                            them to pieet the growing wants of the country on their lines.</p>
                        <p>We cannot, if we would, ignore the fact, that during the rebellion, the
                            railroads of Indiana have done a work, the value of which cannot be
                            computed in dollars and cents - not only for our own State, but other
                            States and the General Government.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the Committee, derived from the numerous
                            petititions, resolutions, etc., coming into their hands from various
                            parts of the State, that there are many cases where the people have just
                            cause of complaint on account of the almost total neglect of the local
                            freight, and the preference given to through freight. This, in the
                            opinion of the Committee, is all wrong. Local interests should be looked
                            after first, in order to the more speedy development of the resources of
                            the State; and in case such measures are not adopted by the different
                            roads, legislation will become a necessity. Your Committee would,
                            therefore, respectfully suggest to the managers of the different roads
                            within this State, or that operate lines running through the State, that
                            they give this matter their immediate attention, so that no citizen may
                            have cause of complaint; and as there, are still portions of our State
                            without railroad facilities, that the people along the proposed lines
                            may be encouraged to assist in the upbuilding of such roads, which so
                            materially aid in the development of the resources of this great
                            State.The difficulty was in regard to perishable property offered as
                            freight. He thought the growing interests of the State would demand that
                            the Railroads should carry perishable freight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM. As the Committee had not a fair opportunity to consider the
                            bill, he moved that it be recommitted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. Notwithstanding the great public benefit of Railroads, in
                            developing the resources of the State, it must be acknowledged that the
                            people along their lines, and the legislation of the State, have
                            conferred great benefits on the Railroads. If they can carry through
                            freight, they can carry local and way freight. He hoped the bill would
                            not be postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY was opposed both to the postponement and the recommitment. He
                            alleged that the Wabash and Erie Railroad refused just accommodations to
                            the country; and he denounced monopolies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LITSON preferred recommitment. He <pb n="174" xml:id="VAA8558-08-174"/>had received no notice of the meetings of the Committee to consider
                            this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. KILGORE alleged that the Chairman of the
                                <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName> (Mr. Lockhart] had ever been
                            fair and courteous in his notices and invitations for Committee meetings
                            - the latter alleging that the opinions of the Chairman could not be
                            taken as the judgment of the Committee. He spoke of the fact of the
                            selfish, injurious management of Railroads passing through this State,
                            and owned in New York. The Committee had consented that this bill should
                            be reported, in order that it might give place to some other bill, such
                            as that introduced by the gentleman from St. Joseph (Mr. Henricks.) If
                            the Legislature should adjourn without action on this Subject, the
                            tariff of freight would be increased on the first of January. He
                            gathered this from the proceedings of a late Railroad meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL said complaints were made in till parts of the Sjate against
                            the lack of Railroad accommodations for way-freight: and men were ruined
                            in their business in consequence. He had no information of the Railroads
                            proposing to remedy this grievance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, rather concurred in the views expressed by the
                            Chairman of the <orgName>Railroad Committee</orgName>. He was not
                            willing to support legislation unfriendly to Railroad 'companies.
                            He was willing to take middle ground, that would guard the interests of
                            the people. But under certain circumstances, and in certain seasons it
                            would be impossible for any Railroad to be prepared to carry promptly
                            all descriptions of freight. It would be an unjust requisition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLEASON stated that he had participated in the deliberations of the
                                <orgName>Committee on Railroads</orgName>. He also concurred in the
                            remarks by the Chairman (Mr. Lockhart.) We should be cautious in
                            legislation on railroads, which had done more than anything else to
                            develop the agricultural resources of the country. It should not be
                            forgotten that it was strictly the interest of railroad men to transport
                            all the freight offered on their line; and therefore he had consented to
                            the report for the indefinite postponement of the bill. The railroad
                            system itself would in the end suggest the most advantageous
                            arrangements for freight.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS said, when railroads trnch on the rights of the people, they
                            ought to be restrained and regulated by legislation. The people had
                            almost entirely abandoned all other modes of transportation. The
                            railroads had monopoly of thisthey were the common carriers of the
                            nation, and they should be restrained from the infliction of injuries,
                            which their position gives them the power to do. They would not now take
                            a cord of wood to market for any man living on their lines. The bill was
                            not to injure the railroads, but to protect the rights of the people in
                            this regard. He moved that it be made a special order.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said that the bill was not in possession of the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM withdrew the motion to recommit.</p>
                        <p>Mr, HENRICKS would move to lay the report on the table, that the bill may
                            take its place on the Calendar.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said that would not effect the object.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH, A large number of the railroads - nearly all of the roads
                            passing over the State, were authorized under special charters: and the
                            bill proposed only to affect those operating under the General Railroad
                            Law. Would it not be better to have a bill that would affect all
                            railroads alike? He submitted whether there was power in the Legislature
                            to pass a law affecting either of these classes of roads. Whilsr the
                            Legislature has the power to regulate railroads, it has no power to
                            impair vested rights. He moved to re-commit the bill to the Judiciary
                            Committee, with instructions to consider and report a proper bill.</p>
                        <p>[On motion by Mr. Meredith, Mr. Cook obtained leave of absence on account
                            of illness in his family].</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. The best way to test the question whether the people can
                            control the Railroads or not, was to pass the bill; and see whether we
                            have got to be a New Jersey State on this question. He recited cases of
                            hardships in high prices for way freight, and desired to know whether we
                            were to be mude a mere pathway for these channels of trade owned in
                            eastern cities. He confessed the developing power of R. R's.; but
                            still we should hold them in check, and prevent the tendency to
                            monopolies and favoritcisms amongst R. R. men and their favorites. He
                            preferred, if the bill was to be referred, that it go to a special
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE demanded the previous question, and under its operation, Mr.
                            Coffroth's motion to commit to the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName> with instructions was rejected - yeas 29, nays
                            43; and the question recurred on indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>[On motion by Mr. BROWN his Locomosivo Engineer bill [H. R. 301] was
                            taken up and made the special order for Tuesday 10 o'clock.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH, desiring further information in the premises, hoped that
                            the bill would not be indefinitely postponed.</p>
                        <p>He demanded the yeas and nays on the question, which resulted - yeas 6,
                            nays 61; so the House refused to postpone, and the bill remains in the
                            calendar.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS, (by consent) from the select committee thereon, returned
                            Mr. Buskirk's Agricultural College bill [H. R. No. 6], locating
                            said college at Bloomington, with an amendment by way of substitute.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, it was made the special order for Tuesday, 10

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM called up the special order, viz.: the consideration of the
                            joint committee's State Debt Sinking Fund bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>], the question being on

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB took the floor and spoke at length in support of the bill,
                            alleging his surprise at the partisan opposition to this bill initiated
                            by Democratic members, - especially in the speeches of Mr. Coffroth. He
                            complained that that gentleman voted for the fifteen cents levy in the
                            Joint Committee, and alleged his inconsistency and unfairness in that,
                            as well as in his professions of a desire to adjust and pay the public
                            debt, but at the same time insisting that it shall not be done till
                            Government bonds shall be taxed as other property, and admitting that
                            there is no power to tax Government bonds under the decisions of the
                            Supreme Court of this State and of the United <pb n="175" xml:id="VAA8558-08-175"/> States. Mr. N. showed that taxing these
                            bonds, even if it were legal and possible, would inflict the greatest
                            financial distress upon the whole country. His speech will be printed in
                            the BREVIER APPENDIX. Before he had concluded, he gave way for a recess

                            internal improvements, in response to a resolution of the House adopted
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved that the letter be laid on the table and two hundred
                            copies thereof printed for the use of the House.</p>
                        <p>The motion was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL demanded the yeas and nays on the motion to print the Butler
                            letter - the vote resulting - no quorum voting. After the call of the
                            Roll - </p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER directed the Doorkeeper to close the doors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, thinking that sending for absentees would not result in doing
                            any business to-day, moved that further proceedings under the call be
                            dispensed with.</p>
                        <p>The CHAIR could not entertain the motion under the rules.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN then appealed from the decision of the Chair.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) could not entertain an appeal in
                            the present condition of the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN thon moved an adjournment, but withdrew it upon request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM asked leave of absence.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER could not entertain any motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER made an ineffectual motion to adjourn - affirmative 12,
                            negative 30.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER moved a resolution to thc effect that each member absent
                            without leave be fined in the sum of $5 for each day of their
                            Absence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM made the point that under the rules, the resolution is not in
                            order, because the penalty shall be determined upon the absentee being
                            brought to the Bar of the House. He desired to lay it on the table</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER directed the Roll-call again, to ascertain
                            delinquents - the Chair holding that the Rules require all absentees
                            without excuse, to be sent for, unless the member is himself sick.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL alleged that it was in the discretion of the House whether
                            they send for any absentee - he referred to Rule 14.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. The House, should designate who they will, send for. The House
                            has the same power to revoke an order that it has to make an order.</p>
                        <p>The Doorkeeper having been despatched for absentees by direction of the
                            Chair - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN moved an adjournment - affirmative 20, negative 24.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Griffith considered if it was competent for the House to send for
                            absentees, it was competent for the House to excuse them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK stated the discretion of the House, and gave his opinion that
                            absentees now should be dealt with in such a manner as will vindicate
                            the dignity of the House. He asked the Chair to decide upon the excuse
                            of Mr. Abbett. There might be cases in which there would be hardship and
                            inhumanity in sending for a member.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDING OFFICER decided, that there being no House to grant a leave
                            of absence, no leave can be granted. He saw no difference in the present
                            case between exusing a man for absence, and refusing to sent for
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT would suggest that the pending call of the House be adjourned
                            over till Monday. There would be a propriety in having those present in
                            the House that cannot be got here to-day; and a useless protraction of
                            the session now might not prove the most creditable either to ourselves
                            of the State. He thought it would be better to adjourn the call, and
                            save ourselves from unavailing efforts to get a quorum; and if gentlemen
                            would permit him, he would make that motion.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon the House (at 1/2 P.M.) adjourned till Monday morning 9
                            o'clock.</p>

                        be needed. The report says with reference to the last inquiry that there was

                        <p>The PRESIDENT announced the consideration of the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_158">H. R. 158</ref>, for a just and
                            equitatable of Railroad property - the question being on the pending
                            amendment [Mr.<pb n="176" xml:id="VAA8558-08-176"/>Vawter's] to
                            strike out the first and sixth sections of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER, in summing up, gave the following reasons why he should
                            oppose the bill under consideration unless his amendments were
                            adopted.</p>
                        <list type="ordered">
                            <item n="First">Because the statement required, of Railroads is not
                                specific enough, and the information required will operate in favor
                                of the Railroads and against a just valuation.</item>
                            <item n="Second">Because the sixth section of the bill is contrary to
                                the spirit of the Constitution, which declares that all taxation
                                shall be equal, and if railroads are forgiven their delinquency it,
                                in fact, destroys that equality.</item>
                            <item n="Third">Because it is a benefit conferred exclusively upon
                                Railroads. No adjustments are made with persons unable to pay their
                                taxes. The poor men of the country must pay their taxes or suffer
                                the consequences. But to Railroad corporations an exclusive immunity
                                is given by the sixth section of this bill.</item>
                            <item n="Fourth">Because the valuations made which the sixth section
                                proposes to legalize, were maide - not by the appraisers elected by
                                the people - but by the unauthorized act of the County Auditors,
                                upon the demand of the railroad Corporations, coupled with a threat
                                that unless it was made, no taxes would be paid.</item>
                            <item n="Fifth">Because in the case of the New Albany &amp; Salem
                                Railroad, for whose special benefit this bill is pressed with such
                                pertinacity, the valuation is clearly unjust. Think of a Railroad
                                with its road bed, rolling stock, warehouses, track, etc., etc.,
                                being valued at $750 per mile, when the track alone would sell for
                                greatly over that amount.</item>
                            <item n="Sixth">Sixth. Because if we are to believe the Auditor of State
                                in his official report to the Senate, the counties and State will
                                lose near a millionof dolIars, which will go to corporations that
                                have shown no favors to the people of Indiana.</item>
                            <item n="Seventh">Because the passage of this bill will lose to the
                                Common School Fund - to the children of the State - fifty thousand
                                or more dollars. And I know no reason in Railroad history in Indiana
                                that entitles them to any such legislation.</item>
                            <item n="Eighth">Because the passage of this bill will t&gt;e a triumph
                                to Railroad monopolies, relieving them from burdens imposed upon
                                them by, law, and transferring them to an already tax-burdened
                                people.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. The friends of this bill want it to go through on its merits;
                            and they are satisfied if members of the Senate understand its
                            provisions there will be no trouble about its passing. The great point
                            made in opposition is with reference to releasing the Lou. N, A. &amp;
                            Chi. R. R. Company from the back tax assessed against it under the law
                            of 1852. There can be no question in the minds of Senators in regard to
                            that provision being just. The tax on the assessment of the year 1852
                            would amount to $42,900 a year from 1854 to 1858, and in those years
                            that Railroad company fell in debt to its work hands $200,000; and when
                            the present managers of that road took hold of it they found that debt
                            resting upon it. The managers becoming satisfied they could not pay, the
                            taxes under that assessment they became delinquent from 1854 to 1859;
                            but under the law of 1850 they went back and paid their taxes from 1854
                            to 1858, through an adjustment made and agreed to by the officers of
                            State at that time.</p>
                        <p>Senators can see the great inequality practiced upon this road when they
                            are told that the law of 1852 imposed upon it more than one-half the
                            burdens of the entire railroad interests of the State. The original
                            bond-holders the men who built that road for the good of the public -
                            have not received one dollar from it; but on the contrary over
                            $l,800,000 is due by way of interest to the persons who entered into
                            that work and constructed it. It is a poor road - they have not got it
                            in good condition yet, but they hope to make it better before long. It
                            cannot even supply the mills in New Albany which buy their wheat in
                            Chicago with grain to keep them running, because it is not able to buy
                            rolling stock necessary for the transportation.</p>
                        <p>He insisted that this bill would place all railroad companies upon an
                            equal basis. If this bill passes, railroad companies will be compelled
                            to yield an equal and just taxation. We present you here with a bill
                            that is perfect as every attorney will say, and, as the distinguished
                            Senator from Laporte [Mr. Niles.] has already said, it is as perfect a
                            bill as the wit of man can devise.</p>
                        <p>He referred to a report of the Supreme Court of the State, going to show
                            what it takes to make a valid assessment, and what it takes to enable a
                            judgment to be given in cases of this kind; and he undertook to say that
                            there was not a provision complied with in this assessment. But suppose
                            you were to receive a judgment for these taxes; it would be nothing but
                            a useless litigation that would only tend to line the pockets of
                            attorneys. This Company is too poor to pay. You find that they have
                            nothing but material necessary for the running of the road, and you sell
                            it and you leave it without being able to meet the necessities of the
                            country through which it passes; and then your debt will not be paid.
                            But he put it on another ground. You can not recover - these suits can
                            never be sustained. The best legal talent of the State are unanimous in
                            the opinion that judgment can not be obtained. He submitted whether
                            Senators were not willing to do justice to a great public improvement of
                            so much benefit to the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN inquired what the appraisement was, per mile, under the law
                            of 1859?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. Seven hundred and fifty dollars per mile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. Was it not $3,500? That is the reduction made by the
                            Auditors of the counties, as he understood it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. If was made $750 by local appraisers, and the Board of
                            Equalization confirmed it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT understood that the Board of Appraisement made it $8,500 per
                            mile, hut by some hocus pocus it was cut down to $750.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. The Auditor's report shows that the assessment per mile by
                            the district appraisers was $750; and by the State Board it was put at
                            the same price.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. The first appraisement under the law of 1859, was made at
                            Crawfordsville by a portion only of the county officers, and they put it
                            at the sum named by the Senator from Kosciusko [Mr. Chapman.] But it was
                            not a full Board by any means. The appraisement was not a legal one -
                            and it is a grave <pb n="177" xml:id="VAA8558-08-177"/>question whether
                            any of them are legal. Another Board was called, when they were all
                            present, as he believed, and they appraised it at $750 per mile; and
                            then the Board of Equalization which met at Indianapolis, confirmed that
                            appraisement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BONHAM. Has not the Auditor of gtate already recovered judgment for
                            the amount of these taxes?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. No sir. There are suits brought but there never will be
                            judgments rendered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. Is the Auditor claiming under the $3,500 assessment?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. He is claiming under the original assessment, under the law of
                            1852, $4,600,000. His position, or the position of his lawyers is, that
                            the law of 1859 is unconstitutional, and the company is liable under the
                            law of 1852.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES understood, and supposed it unquestionably true, that the
                            assessment of the four million and a half against this poverty-stricken
                            Railroad, was on account of a ruinous statement made as a basis by the
                            President of this road, who gave in for assessment the cost of the road,
                            which all will agree was palpably unjust.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY. The amount of the mortgage debt of this road is $2,800,000,
                            and the accumulated interest on that debt is $1,080,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. It is very poor, indeed. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT. If we pass this bill as it now stands, will it not let all
                            other roads out of their taxes?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. No, sir. This bill is particularly guarded with reference to
                            that point. To talk about losing millions of dollars by this bill is all
                            nonsense. It is untrue, as gentlemen will see from the reading of the
                            bill. We ask as a matter of even handed justice that this bill shall be
                            passed, and that this burden upon a railroad 288 miles long, running the
                            entire length of our State, shall be removed.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COBB the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 83,
                            nays 10.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Committee was then concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT. The first section of the bill provides for an appraisement on
                            the first Monday in April, 1866, and then it provides in the fifth
                            section that the Commissioner of such railroad company can appeal to the
                            State Board of Equalization; which does not meet till 1869. Then if an
                            appeal is taken, it would have to lie over till the meeting of the State
                            Board. This is a question that ought to be looked into.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB. There is a provision in the bill which requires them to pay
                            their delinquent tax before they can appeal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES apologized for using: so strong an expression as he did in ttie
                            heat of debate on Saturday, when he said that this bill was as perfect
                            as the wit of man could make it; and he proceeded to point out several
                            clerical and typographical errors.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COBB the Committee amendinents were considered as
                            engrossed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY. If it be true, as suggested by the Senator from Jasper, [Mr.
                            Wright,] that railroads can take an appeal, and thereby suspend the
                            appraisement of railroad property until the meeting of the State Board
                            in 1869, that would be a serious objection to the bill. The State would
                            not be authorized to go on and collect upon an appraisement, when there
                            might be an appeal pending. Unless this can be corrected, he could not
                            vote for the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD. If the special school tax, township tax, road tax. and the
                            school tax are not to be considered State taxes, as he understood this
                            bill, they could not be collected under it. It seems in legislation
                            heretofore, there has been a distinction made between State taxes and
                            school taxes, and there ought to be some provision made in this bill to
                            cover this particular class of taxes. He moved to amend by inserting
                            appropriately these words: "All taxes assessed by State, County, or
                            Township; authority;" so that there shall be no question as to the
                            construction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN had prepared an amendment which would obviate the difficulty
                            suggested by the Senators from Jasper [Mr. Wright] and from Ohio [Mr.
                            Downey;] viz: add appropriately in section 5 this: "provided the
                            right of appeal shall not apply to assessments made in the year
                            1866."</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES had written an amendment reading thus: "Provided no such
                            appeal shall lie till the second appraisement under this act shall have
                            been made." There had occurred to him another difficulty. It will
                            be remembered that this bill was prepared be different personsonly the
                            8th section was written wholly by himselfand this will account perhaps
                            for a want of coherence; and it justifies the apology he made for his
                            strong expression of the other day, in which he really had reference to
                            the basis of the bill. Section 7 provides that cities and incorporated
                            towns shall tax railroads the same rate per mile as the valuation is for
                            city and town taxation. Looking at that in connection with the fact of
                            their being subject to township taxes, school, road and special school
                            taxes, which probably ought to be provided for distinctly; he suggested
                            whether that would not lead to double taxation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to recommit the bill and proposed amendments to the
                            same committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The demand was seconded by the Senate and, under its operation - </p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected upon a division - affirmative 14,
                            negative not counted farther than 16.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER had; opposed this bill as strenuously as any one on the floor,
                            but as there appears to be a disposition to pass it, he appealed to
                            Senators objecting to the amendments proposed to withdraw their
                            opposition and let the bill be perfected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON, though favorable to the bill, opposed this way of bringing in
                            amendments on the third reading of a bill, and would prefer the House
                            shall take the responsibility of adding these necessary provisions.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then read the third time and passed the Senate by yeas 80,
                            nays 13, with an amendment of title.</p>

                        <p>Mr. ENGLISH hoped the bill would not be taken up. Perhaps not a Senator
                            on the floor is interested in it but himself. It is called a <pb n="178" xml:id="VAA8558-08-178"/>general bill but in reality is intended to
                            change the county seat of Clark county. He had written home for
                            instructions with regard to this matter, and was waiting impatiently for
                            directions so that he might know what course to pursue on the subject.
                            He desired that the bill should take its proper course - he did not want
                            the bill forced upon the Senate. It is a local bill entirely and
                            interferes with no Senator's district but his own.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN replied that other portions of the State were interested in the
                            bill besides the district of the Senator from Scott, [Mr. English.] He
                            simply desired the bill read by title fpr the purpose of referring it to

                        <p>The demand was seconded, and the Secretary proceeded to call the

                        <p>Mr. CULLEN said: As two Senators have come in which will insure the
                            passage of the bill, I move that further proceedings under the call be
                            dispensed with.</p>
                        <p>The motion was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The result of the vote on the passage of the real estate appraisement

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB being entitled to the floor, resumed his speech in support of
                            the bill at the point he was interrupted by the adjournment Saturday
                            morning. He continued his reply to the speeches of last week by Mr.
                            Coffroth and Mr. Dunham. He showed by figures, that it would be suicidal
                            for the State of Indiana or the several States, to ask and to be allowed
                            to tax United States bonds - that she would gain little, as compared
                            with the larger stock-owning States; and that in the end the State of
                            Indiana would be the greater loser in taxation to make up the
                            depreciation in United States stocks that would follow upon their
                            taxation for the benefit of the treasuries of the wealthier and larger
                            bond-holding States.</p>
                        <p>[The speech is reserved for correction. It will be printed
                            hereafter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON asked the indulgence of the House to state his objections.
                            The bill imposes a tax of 15 cents on each $100 valuation of the taxable
                            property of the State for the year 1866, and every year thereafter until
                            the interest and principal of the war loan bonds and certificates of
                            State stock are fully paid, the amount of revenue thus derived to be
                            applied in the payment of these war loan bonds and certificates of State
                            stock indiscriminately. It has been said that the main object in
                            convening this extra session of the Legislature was to adjust the State
                            debt falling due in January next. I believe, however, the Governor has
                            never publicly announced such to have been the object. We are informed
                            by the Governor's message that the amount of tlie public debt of
                            the State, consisting of 2 1/2 and 5 per cent, registered stocks is
                            $1,418,960 50. Of this amount, the sum of $5,342,500 is 5 per cent., and
                            the sum of $2,076,460 50 is 2 1/2 per cent. stock. Of these stocks, the
                            Board of Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, and the State Debt Sinking
                            Fund, have purchased in all, $1,382,898, leaving outstanding, in the
                            hands of the creditors of the State, the amount of $6,036,080.It is
                            understood in the bonds that they are redeemable at the pleasure of the
                            State, which I suppose means at the convenience of the State. I had
                            hoped that the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Monroe, to
                            strike out of the first section of the bill the war loan bonds, would
                            have been adopted. The war bonds were issued under the act of May 13,
                            1861, authorizing the Governor to issue two millions of these bonds. The
                            act provides that these bonds shall be made payable to bearer twenty
                            years after date, with interest at the rate of six per cent, per annum,
                            on the first days of November of each year, at the Indiana Agency in the
                            City of New York. There can be no question as to the fact that these
                            bonds are not due for about seventeen years to come, yet the bill
                            proposes to provide for the payment of these bonds at the same time, in
                            the same manner; and in fact, they have a preference, in so far as
                            placing them first in the bill will give their payment preference over
                            the stocks of the State issued twenty years ago.</p>
                        <p>The burthens of taxation, already oppressive to the people, will be
                            greatly increased by the passage of the bill, and that too, at a time
                            when nearly one-fifth of the taxable capital of the State is invested in
                            Government securities, which are, as every one knows, exempt from
                            taxation. Whether this will ever be sufficient, I shall not Undertake to
                            say, and so far as the payment of the stocks of the State issued twenty
                            years ago is concerned, it is not in my judgment material to inquire.
                            Justice to the holders of these obligations, and good faith on the part
                            of the State, requires that these obligations should be satisfied as
                            soon as the State can conveniently meet them, but the case is, in my
                            judgment, different in regard to the war loan bonds. There can be no
                            pretence that these bonds are due, and why should we increase the
                            burdens of taxation in order to pay them, (even if we could compel the
                            bearers thereof to accept payment before they mature,) at a time when we
                            are unable to discharge a debt incurred twenty years ago. The payment of
                            these war bonds should be deferred until such time as it may suit the
                            convenience of the State, if they are to be satisfied before maturity,
                            and until all classes of our citizens may have the opportunity of being
                            assessed for their payment.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to be understood as favoring any scheme of finance that
                            will imply even a suspicion of repudiation. As to the question of the
                            power of Congress to tax the United States bonds, I believe no one
                            contends that <pb n="180" xml:id="VAA8558-08-180"/> this can be done
                            while the bonds remain in their present form, as there are undoubtedly
                            tested rights in the holders of them. The next question is, has Congress
                            the power to so modify or change the bonds by issuing a new one to the
                            holders (in lieu of the present ones,) that shall be liable to taxation?
                            I am not aware that this question has ever been directly decided by the
                            Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Weston vs. The City
                            of Charleston, Second Peters' Reports, decided many years since,
                            the city attempted to tax certain United States securities in his
                            [Weston's] hands; the Court held that the State had no power to tax
                            a United States bond, containing no prohibiton, in the hands of the
                            bearer thereof. The point, however, whether Congress had the power to
                            modify or change the bond was not decided. Sir, it has been said that
                            this Is, and should not be a party question, for the reason that it is a
                            question in which the whole people are interested. There is perhaps no
                            question upon which the people are so sensative, or in which they take
                            so deep an interest, as the one of taxation. There are at this time
                            unmistakable signs of discontent among our people in consequence of the
                            present unequal system of taxation. High prices lor all the necessaries
                            of life still continue, notwithstanding the war is over, and why is
                            this? The answer is, taxation. Look at one of the resolutions recently
                            adopted at the Working-men's Convention held in this city, which is
                            as follows:</p>

                        <p>No favored class should demand freedom from assessment, and the taxes
                            should be so distributed as not to fall unduly on the poor, but rather
                            on the accumulated wealth of the country.</p>
                        <p>It is a matter of history that this question of levying taxes to provide
                            for the payment of a war debt once caused an insurrection in this
                            country (under circumstances less obnoxious than the present,) known as
                            Shay's Rebellion. The war of the Revolution involved the United
                            States in a debt of $40,000,000. Of this sum $8,000,000 were borrowed
                            from foreign powers. The rules of the Confederation of 1777, empowered
                            Congress to carry on the war; but they had no power to provide for its
                            expenses. They could only recommend to the several States to raise money
                            for that purpose. Accordingly in 1781, Congress passed a resolution,
                            requesting the several States to furnish their proportion respectively
                            of the eight millions of dollars of borrowed money. They also appointed
                            a committee to determine what proportion of the money ought to be paid
                            by each State. It was proposed to the States that a duty of four per
                            cent, on all foreign goods imported into the United States should be
                            paid, and that the revenue arising therefrom should be applied to the
                            payment of the national debt, both foreign and domestic. The latter was
                            principally due to the officers and soldiers of the army. All the
                            States, except Rhode Island and New York, assented to the proposal. But
                            as these two States had a large share of the public trade their refusal
                            to contribute to pay the public debt defeated the whole plan; and the
                            consequence was, that even the interest of the matured debt remained
                            unpaid. Under these embarrassing circumstances, it was perfectly natural
                            for those States which felt desirous of discharging their debts in an
                            honorable man, ner, to make the utmost exertion to do their part. The
                            country was not, however, in a perfectly settled state. There were some
                            men in Massachusetts who, though they had been willing, in 1776, to go
                            to war with Great Britain rather than submit to taxation without
                            representation were willing, in 1786, to go to war with the Government
                            rather than pay their share of the expenses which the contest with Great
                            Britain had occasioned. As to whether these men were bondholders or not
                            I am not advised. In some parts of the country tumultuous assemblies,
                            under the specious names of conventions, were assembled, which
                            obstructed the courts and other bodies. Shay, who had been a Captain in
                            the revolutionary war, was considered as the head of the insurgents,
                            hence the movement took the name of Shay's Insurrection. The
                            insurgents continued to increase until they numbered 1,500, the spirit
                            of opposition to taxation was rife everywhere, and it required a body of
                            4,000 armed men to sustain the courts and suppress the insurrection.</p>
                        <p>Now, as the State is not prepared to meet the whole amount of this
                            indebtedness at this time without increasing the burdens of taxation,
                            (already oppressive to the people) as proposed by the bill, it seems to
                            me that justice to the bondholders, and good faith on'the part of
                            the State, requires that the amount of funds on hand of the State debt
                            Sinking Fund, which is said to be about $1,600,000, should be applied in
                            payment on the State stocks issued twenty years ago, with such a tax as
                            may be sufficient for that purpose,only leaving the residue, together
                            with the war levies to be provided for and paid hereafter, and at such
                            time, as shall suit the convenience of the State to do so.</p>
                        <p>There is no disguising the fact that a large class of our citizens are
                            demanding the taxation of the Government securities held by another
                            class in the State, and the present indications are that they will not
                            be satisfied until it is done, or at least until the experiment of so
                            doing is tested before the proper tribunals of the country.</p>
                        <p>On the motion of Mr. BRANHAM, the further consideration of the bill was
                            postponed, and it was made the special order for to-morrow morning 10

                        <p>Mr. WOODS moved an order to take up bills of the House on the third

                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH moved to amend, by substituting the consideration of bills

                        <p>Mr Kilgore's Fish Protection bill [H. R. 174] coming np with the
                            Committee amendment, making it unlawful to take fish by seine, net or
                            trap - </p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS moved in effectually to exempt the St. Joseph river from the
                            provisions of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS then moved to amend the amendment by exempting Cedar Lake and
                            all the frog-ponds in Lake county.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to, and then the amendment, as amended, was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL. Between the 15th of June and the month of September was the
                            best fishing season of the year with his people; and this was part of
                            the time in which fishing was prohibited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER. By this bill, fishing was prohibited from December till
                            March, and this was the best time for fishing with his people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK said the good fishing in his region invited fishers from
                            Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois, who would come in with their
                            gill netts and take away the fish to the injury of farmers along their
                            streams of water. He hoped the bill would pass, for he wanted something
                            to protect the home fisheries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN said the spirit of the bill was right. But it restricted hook
                            and line fishing when they could be best caught. He moved to reconsider
                            the vote by which the bill was ordered to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART. The best months in the year for his people to fish was
                            February and Marchtaking them through the ice. The bill prohibited
                            taking fish during these months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown's motion was agreed to, and the vote was reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLLER proposed now to amend by way of substitute, making it
                            Unlawful to take fish by seine, net or trap, except in Lake Michigan and
                            the Ohio. Penalty $10 to $100.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE moved to amend the amendment by prohibiting shooting fish.
                            There was more destruction of the fish of the State by shooting the
                            female fish in the spawning season, from the first to the middle of
                            June, than from all other causes.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. MILLER, the bill with the pending amendments was
                            recommitted to the <orgName>Committee on Rights and
                            Privileges</orgName>.</p>

                        <p>Mr. PRATHER said, whatever the lawyers might wish, the people did not

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK explained the bill.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BRATHER moved a call of the House, which proceeded - the Clerk

                            till the loss is duly paid. It compels foreign companies to set out a
                            clear record, and to do a legitimate business. The bill would do
                            something for the protection of people of the State.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Sim's bill No. 290, to amend the justice's act (to fine a
                            juror who fails to attend) coming up - </p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, it was indefinitely postponed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shoaff of Jay's 13th Circuit Court bill No. 272, coming up, it
                            was ordered to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>The Roads Committee's Swinging Gates bill [H. R. No. 286] coming up
                            with a favorable Committee recommendation - </p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS moved its indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE. The bill was adapted to a case in Putnam county. He did not
                            think the County Commissioners would be likely to abuse the
                            provision.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER and Mr. BURTON thought also that it was a good bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS withdrew the motion to postpone.</p>
                        <p>The bill was ordered to the engrossment and third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Church's change of venue bill. No. 261, amending the 208th
                            section of the Practice act, coming up with a favorable committee
                            recommendation - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved to strike out the emergency clause.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH stated the change proposed. The case shall be immediately
                            transferred to the Circuit Court - preventing the delay of sending
                            causes back to the Common Pleas.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was adopted: and so the bill was passed to the engrossment
                            and third reading.</p>
                        <p>The bill [H. R. 268] to amend the 104th section of the assessment law of
                            1852, etc., so as to increase the mileage of the County Treasurers
                            collecting delinquent taxes, coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER thought the fees too low - the mileage was now chargeable
                            only to the place of holding elections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN considered the mileage was ample.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY. Inadequate compensation prevented the collection of delinquent
                            taxes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. There was nearly a million of dollars of delinquent taxes
                            unpaid in the State at this time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STEWART said the office of County Treasurer was one of the best
                            paying offices in the State. He was disposed to postpone it
                            indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BIRD thought the County Treasurers were poorly paid.</p>
                        <p>The House refused to postpone - affirmative 27, negative 41.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then ordered to the engrossment and third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Groves' delinquent collection fee bill No. 247, coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved to amend so as to read "deputy or constable,"
                            which was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>So the bill was ordered to the engrossment and third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Newcomb's seven years absentee bill, No. 77, coming up, with a
                            favorable recommendation from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>
                            - </p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER thought the bill might work hardships to minors that might be
                            kept out of the State seven years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained. There was a case in this county requiring such a
                            law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved ineffectually to strike out the emergency clause.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then advanced to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kilgore's Insurance bill, No. 286, coming up with a favorable
                            recommendation by the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, it was
                            passed to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henrick's Gettysburg National Cemetery Appropriation bill. No.
                            269, coming up,it was passed to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Shoaff of Jay's Common Pleas bill, No, 275, coming up, it was
                            advanced to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Miller's forfeited recognizance bill, No, 297, was advanced to
                            the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown's landlords and tenants bill. No. 293, was advanced to the
                            third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lasselle's execution exemption bill, No. 295, was advanced to
                            the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's locomotive engineers bill, No, 244, coming up, with a
                            committee recommendation that it be laid on the table, it was so
                            ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stringer's assessment bill, No. 99, coming up with favorable
                            committee recommend actions - </p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER merely stated that it changes the time from June to the
                            second Tuesday in April, when the assessors shall make their
                            reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS thought it would give ample time for the assessor, if he work
                            faithfully from the first of January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY. The assessor for Centre Township, in Marion county, had not
                            time now to complete his work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER, The bill provides that further time may be granted if
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS proposed to amend by Inserting a provison requiring the
                            assessor to asses all the resident women over 21 years of age.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS explained this amendment amidst a choking scene of
                            merriment.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>The bill was advanced to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER called up his bill No. 136, [amending the law in relation to
                            the election of assessors to complete the bill, No. 99] and it was read
                            the second time, and passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>And then, on motion by Mr. GROVES, the House (at 9.30 P. M.)

                                        Senators they were perfectly surprised at the volumnous
                                        character of the work and by what authority he said was
                                        ordered, therefore - </p>
                                    <p><hi rend="i">Be it Resolved</hi>, That a Committee of three

                        <p>Mr. COBB was just drawing up a resolution something similar. He
                            understood there was to be three or four volumes of this work, and that
                            the cost of printing would be $75,000. It is a valuable work, and does
                            credit to the Adjutant General, but the question is whether we should go
                            to this expense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK understood that the Adjutant General says it would take
                            seven volumes. The House has ordered two thousand copies, and we have
                            ordered two thousand five hundred. Seven volumes of each would be thirty
                            one thousand live hundred, which, at three dollars a copy, would cost
                            $94,500.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON perhaps owed an apology to the Senate for offering one of the
                            resolutions on which the printing of these books was based. It was
                            presented to him by somebody with the, statement that the House had
                            ordered the Adjutant General's report to be distributed, and the
                            Senate would not get any unless they made this order. Taking it to be
                            'the report of last winter, already made, and as it was usual to
                            have such things distributed, he ottered that resolution with that
                            understanding. He had no more idea of a bound volume than of anything
                            else that could be imagined out of the ordinary routine of business, and
                            did not know any better till some time ago he saw a notice Of the book
                            in the newspapers. He was not willing, as far as he was concerned, to
                            take the responsibility for any such resolution. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB humorously enquired whether he understood the Senator to deny
                            the offering of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON could not very well deny that he offered it, but he disliked to
                            plead guilty. He hoped the Senate would pass the one he now offered, and
                            another one which he had prepared, and desired should be placed upon the
                            table till after the report of the committee to be raised by the
                            resolution under consideration. He would not say that any person
                            intended to impose upon him, but he recollected the language used by
                            that individual as well as if it was but yesterday.</p>
                        <p>VOICES."Name him!" "Name him!"</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. No, he would not; for fear he might not name the person
                            correctly; and he did not want to do any man injustice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER thought the resolution was not full enough. He moved to amend
                            by adding this: "to report the probable cost and number of
                            volumes."</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON accepted the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER had no doubt that the Senator from Boone was imposed upon with
                            the rest of us; but the point is here: the work is accomplished, and it
                            will not do for us to throw the responsibility off our shoulders. It is
                            our business when a resolution is offered to understand it, and then
                            record our votes. He thought he had been snapped himself, and was
                            willing to take his share of the responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON undertook to say that the proper construction of the language
                            of his little resolution would embrace only a report that has already
                            been made. It cannot be a report until it is in existence. The report,
                            as printed in this volume was not in existence, and was no report. If
                            the language is construed properly there is no snapping about it. This
                            report is got in here, and put upon members under a resolution that did
                            not and does not contemplate it. He was not willing that a resolution of
                            this kind should be brought to him, and he made the auther of it, and
                            something brought about that was not authorized by the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that he could not think that the resolution of last
                            session for printing the report of the Adjutant General, justified the
                            printing of seven large volumes at a cost of near $100,000 to the State.
                            He ventured to say that when the brief resolution of last session was
                            offered and adopted, no Senator imagined that it could be construed to
                            warrant the printing of a voluminous work. He did not now undertake to
                            say whether the volumes were worth publishing, as he had not had time to
                            examine the one which had been printed; but he could not but regard the
                            publication of such Volumes under the resolution of the Senate, as
                            little less than a down right imposition on Senators. He was resolved
                            for one, never again to vote for printing anything until he .knew
                            precisely the nature of the document.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, answering to a request, explained that the bill only makes

                            money fifteen days before it comes due, on deposit in some bank in New

                            York, "at least" 15 days before it becomes due. It may be sent
                            there at any time before the fifteen days, if the Treasurer should see
                            proper; and it opens the door for one of the finest speculations; that
                            can be imagined. He demanded that additional safe-guards should be
                            thrown around the bill. This discretionary power should not be left

                            passage of a bill securing bounties to the non-commissioned officers and

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT felt a deep interest in the passage of this resolution, and
                            the securing of bounties to the gallant soldiers of the 12th and 16th
                            regiments, who served the United States in the one year service. He knew
                            the history of both these, organizations well, and was acquainted with
                            many of the men who composed them. They were organized under an act of
                            the General Assembly, authorizing troops for the service of the State,
                            but under the emergencies of the service in the field, the Secretary of
                            War transferred these regiments into the service of the United States,
                            and they remained in such service for one year and until the expiration
                            of their term of service. No more gallant regiments ever enlisted in our
                            State. On the expiration of their term of one year, they reorganized for
                            three years, and their history became a part of the glory of Indiana.
                            Other regiments received bounties for one year service, and even for six
                            months service, and I submit that these soldiers should receive the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. raised the point of order that it was not necessary, as had been
                            the custom heretofore, to read joint resolutions three times, and he

                        <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MlLLIGAN, from the select committee on the World's Fair,
                            returned the "Universal Exposition" bill, S. No. 280, with an
                            amendment, striking out "$5,000," and inserting in lieu
                            "$3,000," as the amount to be expended for traveling expenses
                            of the Commissioner and his clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA looked upon this practically as nothing more than a
                            sight-seeing affair; and he could see no substantial benefits likely to
                            grow out of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT thought it a small contribution for having the great State of
                            Indiana represented in the fair where all the rest of the world will be.
                            He did not know that he could point out the benefits of this proposition
                            better than to quote from the message of the Governor on this subject.
                            He then read that portion of His Excellency's message. [It is
                            printed in the first pages of this book.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA would much rather see this $3,000 or $4,000 expended in the
                            building of a hospitable roof for the poor maniacs of this State who
                            have been pronounced incurable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON. The bill does not provide any pay for the Commissioners or he
                            might oppose it. The agents of emigration societies of the old world
                            will attend this fair to see what kind of a show these several States
                            make, and they will pay good attention to our agricultural and mineral
                            resources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD stood opposed to the bill. He could see no advantages to come
                            from it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. These great fairs are visited by the masses, as he understood
                            it. There is no one thing the State can expend $3,000 in, that will
                            advertise it to the same extent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON. The true aim and object of this bill is that Indiana shall
                            be represented at the World's Fair. He questioned whether there
                            would be a State in the Union unrepresented there, unless it be some of
                            those in the South, whose pecuniary condition will not permit. If
                            Indiana fails to send her representative there, she falls in the scale
                            of States. He looked upon it as an assemblage of nations, and it was
                            absolutely necessary that Indiana should be there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB was unable to see the propriety of the State of Indiana going
                            dresvsed up to the World's Fair while her people at home are
                            groaning under the weight of a heavy debt. He could see nothing growing
                            out of the arguments used by the advocates of this bill going to show
                            that immigration to this State would be advanced a particle. He would
                            prefer to say Indiana was out of debt. That would be a greater
                            inducement for foreigners to settle amongst us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN would do nothing to impede the development of the resources of
                            the State, and would be glad to have Indiana represented in the
                            World's Fair, as is proposed in this bill, but he could see no good
                            to result from the expenditure of money. There is no better way to
                            invite immigration to Indiana than to place her out of debt. As one who
                            desires to do what is right in this matter, he could not vote for this
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON stated that Michigan has appropriated $15,000 for this
                            object: and insisted if the features of the bill will not commend
                            themselves to the good judgment of Senators, he did not know what
                            would.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT moved to recommit the bill with instructions to amend by
                            striking out all that refers to the qualification of the
                            Commissioner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The demand was seconded, by consent.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was rejected by yeas 11, nays 33.</p>
                        <p>The bill then failed to pass by yeas 25, nays 19.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr.
                            Bonham's change of venue bill S. No. 224, to amend section 76 of
                            the General Practice Act. approved June 17, 1852, recommending that it
                            lie on the table.</p>
                        <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT, from the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned Mr.
                            Hanna's bill S. No. 305, in relation to the laying out and opening
                            public highways, recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned
                            Mr. Cason's bill, S. No. 270, increasing the fees of County
                            Auditors and Commissioners; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>These bills were passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE, from a majority of the Select Committee thereon, returned Mr.
                            Dunning's bill, S. No. 263, to.repeal the dog law, recommending its
                            passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT, from a minority of the same Committee, made a report
                            recommending that the bill lie on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Chapman in the Chair). We are now taxing the people of
                            the State beyond what they are able to bear. He rejoiced that the bill
                            to send some man off, as the Senator from Vigo [Mr. Hanna] remarked, a
                            sight seeing, had failed a short time ago. <pb n="186" xml:id="VAA8558-08-186"/> The $3,000 attempted to be appropriated in
                            that bill would pay the interest for one year on $118,000 of 2 1/2 per
                            cent bonds. The people in his section of the State were in favor of the
                            repeal of the dog law. There is more importance attached to this
                            question by the farming community than gentlemen are probably aware of.
                            He spoke in favor of his bill, and insisted if it were passed, and the
                            old law should be put into effect it would afford an ample remedy, as
                            against sheep killing dogs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER. Dogs are a curse and nothing but a curse, with the exception
                            of a few only, the owners of which will gladly pay the tax on them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES knew that the existence of sheep-killing dogs is the greatest
                            of all drawbacks to the farming community. They are worse than the
                            prairie wolves ever were. He had no mercy to show to this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN was satisfied this Legislature passed no law last winter that
                            met with such universal approbation as the law proposed to be repealed
                            by this bill. Instead of repealing it, he stood ready to vote for
                            increasing the tax on useless sheep-killing dogs. His judgement was that
                            one good sheep was worth more than all the dogs in Indiana.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING suggested the wrong that is done in taxing those who own dogs
                            of value for the injury done by probably only one or two worthless curs;
                            and again urged the passage of his bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STAGGS. In connection with the remarks that have been made I will
                            say, that since last winter in my county I have heard considerable
                            inquiry with regard to the dog law and have endeavored to explain it as
                            well as I understood it; and generally they have made objections and
                            told me they thought there was a sufficient law upon the subject without
                            enacting any law last winter; and upon that principle I have settled
                            down, and think the act last winter was unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING made an ineffectual motion yeas 19, nays 24 to lay the
                            minority report upon the table.</p>
                        <p>The minority report was concurred in by yeas 27, nays 10.</p>
                        <p>And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

                                Prison</orgName>, submitted a report on the reports of the Board of
                            Control, and the Superintendent of Construction of said prison, which
                            had been referred to them, asking for an appropriation of $597,744 for
                            the completion of works already commenced on said prison - the Committee
                            recommending items of appropriation for said works, amounting to
                            $62,800, and recommending an order that no further contract be made by
                            the Board of Control to divert any part of said appropriation from its
                            specific object, viz: the completion of works already commenced, - and
                            submitting considerations governing the action of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH moved that the report be concurred in, and that it be
                            referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, with
                            instructions (if they deem it expedient and proper) to incorporate the
                            appropriation recommended into the Specific Appropriation bill. When he
                            came here, at the beginning of the session, he hardly expected any
                            appropriation for this prison. But he found that, having this
                            institution on our hands, and to save what we have already appropriated,
                            and make the prison efficient, it was best to complete the works already
                            commenced. Therefore the committee had unanimously agreed to the amount
                            recommended. The committee had heretofore reported a bill for adding:
                            another tier of counties to the Northern prison District, and that was a
                            decisive consideration in favor of completing these works. The Board of
                            Control had asked for $97,000, whilst the committee, economizing in the
                            light of the best information they could obtain, had agreed to recommend
                            an appropriation of only $62,800.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM thought we were going extravagantly into the expenditures for
                            the prison, and expenses were increasing. He wanted to know where we
                            were going to stop. We made an appropriation for offices and a cell
                            house, and the Board of Control had proceeded, as it would seem, to the
                            completion of the entire prison structure. They might have made the cell
                            house smaller, and their work not liable to decay. He prefered that the
                            House should determine this mutter, and leave nothing to the discretion
                            of the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL said: As a member of the <orgName>Committee on the Northern
                                Prison</orgName>, he could not sustain the report; because he was
                            with out information upon which to make up his mind as to how much
                            should be appropriated in this direction; nor did he believe that
                            determination could be reached intelligently without, visiting the
                            prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. Inasmuch as we have already appropriated about $200,000
                            towards this prison, unless we carry it on to completion, much of this
                            money will be thrown away. He said this, regretting that the Prison had
                            been commenced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM said they wanted $30,000 for a kitchen. Would the gentleman
                            go to work and complete the Prison on that scale?</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. No. He wanted a cell-house, outhouses and auppurtenances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. Either we must abandon this institution, or make
                            appropriations to keep it up. New York had three prisons, at an expense
                            of about eight millions of dollars; and the States of Ohio and Illinois,
                            each had more expensive prisons than we. He recited the history, origin
                            and progress of this Northern Prison; and especially the reasons for
                            increasing the expenses of the offices above the appropriations for that
                            purpose. He rnude statements also with reference to the expenses of the
                            wall, the towers, the cell-house and guardhouse. Our prisons were fast
                            filling up. The <pb n="187" xml:id="VAA8558-08-187"/> Southern prison,
                            he was told, was about full. Crime was on the increase, and we must
                            increase our prison-room. He did not think money had been squandered,
                            and trusted that the report would be concurred in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL did not like the manner of expending money on this prison.
                            The very first contract thereon was not authorized by law; and yet
                            appropriations were subsequently made to save parties to that and other
                            unauthorized contracts. Now the gentleman from Laporte [Mr. Higgins] had
                            told us that the last appropriations have not been applied to the
                            objects intended by them to bo accomplished. He supposed the prison
                            itself was necessary, but opposed the manner in which money was extorted
                            from the Legislature in its construction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH. If gentlemen do not like the the plan of the report, why not
                            propose a better?</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD wanted specific information, apart from the statements of the
                            officers of the institution. But since we have not been permitted to
                            visit the prison, and see for ourselves, we must avail ourselves of the
                            best information we have, and that comes from the officers of the
                            prison. He knew now no better way thrin to appropriate for what is
                            needed for this prison. He supported the motion to refer to the
                                <orgName>committee on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY. The proposed amount would not be sufficient to complete the
                            work. It was going to cost largely above the original estimates. The
                            people of Indiana were not so numerous as the people of New York, and he
                            trusted they were even more honest than New Yorkers - and we need not
                            imitate the prodigality of the State of New York in this direction. He
                            would retrench as to prison expenses, and admonish the people to respect
                            and obey the laws. He hoped the appropriation would not be made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF of Jay. This was a matter of mere business. It became
                            necessary to have another prison. Its necessity had been admitted by the
                            Legislature and the work had been entered upon. It had not been shown
                            that money had been squandered, though something had been lost for want
                            of money. The Committee had reduced the amount of the appropriation as
                            low as they could. He had concurred in the report, and would support it.
                            The remarks of gentlemen here indicated that they had little confidence
                            either in the Board of Control or the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY understood that this proposed appropriation was to carry out
                            contracts of the Board of Control. He deprecated unauthorized contracts;
                            and showed that the Board's contract for bricklaying was to pay
                            one-third more than the sanie work could bo obtained by any business
                            man. He was weary of sanctioning unauthorized contracts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS replied to the objections of Mr. Cowgill, and recited the
                            acts and plans of the original Board of Control, and alleged that the
                            State had adopted them so far as the plans were concerned in the
                            building of the cell-house and guard-house. He also replied to Mr.
                            MeVey; That gentleman should be the last man to object to prisons,
                            considering the number of convicts being sentenced and conveyed to them
                            from the city of Indianapolis. He also referred to the fact that
                            convicts were now confined and guarded in the shops, because there was
                            no cell-house.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH. We had this elephant on our hands, and the question was
                            what shall we do with it? He described the insecure condition of the
                            prison as he saw it. He was not prepared to decide on the contracts for
                            ex-eavations, stone masonry and brick in the wall. But the supposition
                            is that these officers would not make these contracts and publish them
                            at very exhorbitant rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS answered the objections of Mr. Shuey as to cost of stone and
                            masonry.</p>
                        <p>Mr, GROVES demanded the previous question, and under its operation, Mr.
                            Griffith's motion was agreed to - yeas 44, nays 37.</p>

                                        confer with the Governor and State officers, and if, on
                                        exammation they shall see that the expenses of such officer
                                        or officers can be deminished, they shall report a bill or

                            to offer an amendment excepting from its provisions the Wabash and Erie

                        <p>Mr. LANE (upon a suspension of the orders) called up Mr. Trusler's
                            hydraulic bill, No. 256, and moved to amend by adding a section
                            excepting from its provisions the Wabash &amp; Erie Canal.</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed further to amend by inserting this: "nothing in

                        <p>Mr. OSBORN moved ineffectually to lay the bill on the table.And then it
                            was ordered to the engrossment and third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lemon's bill. No. 273, for enforcement of Article XIII of the
                            State Constitution, coming up on the second reading - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said this bill reminded him of the reply of a darkey barber
                            hereto another darkey, alleging a case of <hi rend="i">crim. con.</hi>
                            of his knowledge: said he, "That Constitutional Convention here has
                            decided that no negro shall ever come into this State, so that thing
                            can't be did." [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS moved ineffectually that the bill be indefinitely postponed -
                            yeas 83, nays 34.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL moved ineffectually to insert an amendment properly punishing

                            recommendation from the Prison Committee,</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES moved to amend, by striking out the provision which adds
                            another tier of counties to the Northern Prison District.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH said convict-labor was needed in the construction of the
                            Northern Prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS said that convict labor was worth more at the Northern than
                            it was at the Southern Prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY was in favor of the amendment.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was rejected - affirmative 30, negative 37.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then ordered to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE moved to call up his bill [H. R. No. 309] authorizing the
                            County Commissioners, under certain restrictions upon petition of the
                            people to make appropriations in aid of the construction of
                            manufacturing and machine shops.</p>
                        <p>The committee's amendment "upon petition of one-fourth of the
                            people of the county," was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SULLIVAN of Vanderburgh and Posey, moved ineffectually to amend by
                            providing that of those petitioners none shall be United States
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then ordered to the engrossment?</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. Stringer's Clerk's bill, No. 181,
                            with the pending amendment was taken up - the question being on the
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wood's joint resolution No. 3 for amendment of the State
                            Constitution in article VIII in regard to taxation for schools,was
                            advanced to the engrossment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Whiteside's notice bill No. 18, coming up with the pending
                            amendment, it was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The <orgName>Judiciary Committee's</orgName> amendments to the
                            County Auditor's bill, No. 190, with the committee amendments
                            [increasing his fees to 15 cents per hundred words.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. STIVER proposed to amend the amendment by excepting the fees for
                            filing assessors' blanks.</p>
                        <p>It was adopted: and then the amendment as amended was adopted.</p>
                        <p>So the bill was ordered to the engrossment.</p>

                    <p>Mr. BROWN of Wells. When the resolution of the Senator from Boone [Mr. Cason]
                        was up, yesterday, some remarks were made which I think cast an unjust
                        imputation upon the Adjutant General, while I feebly attempted to do justice
                        to one whom I deem a true man, a high-toned gentleman, and a pure officer.
                        The remarks made on the opposite side were noted quite in full, while the
                        Reporters say "further remarks were made by Messrs. Van Buskirk, Brown
                        of Wells, Bennett, Cobb and McGlurg." These reports go to the world,
                        and nothing can be gathered as to what were the remarks made by these
                        gentlemen. I wish it to go to the world that I did attempt, very feebly, as
                        I have said, to do what I thought was justice to i an honorable man, and I
                        trust the Reporters will give me credit for so doing.</p>

                            relief of persons or their heirs or assigns who have made entry of
                            public lands belonging to the State where the State is not competent to
                            make a good title.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON introduced a bill [S. No. 309] for an Act to amend sections 8
                            and 45 of An Act to reduce the law incorporating the city of Madison
                            into one act, approved February 14,1848. [This bill was read by title
                            only.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG introduced a bill [S. No. 310] for An Act to amend sections 1
                            and 2 of An Act to enable owners of wet lands to drain and reclaim the
                            same, etc., approved March 7, 1863.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT introduced a bill [S. No. 311] for An Act to legalize sales by
                            deputy sheriffs of real estate sola under execution or by order of the
                            Circuit or Common Pleas Courts and render valid deeds made under the
                            provisions thereof.</p>

                            of An Act concerning licenses to vend foreign merchandize, to exhibit
                            caravans, circuses, shows, legerdemain, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CARSON explained that the subject of the act referred to is not
                            embraced in the title, and the object of this bill is to remedy that
                            defect. As it is late in the session, and the probability is that in the
                            ordinary course of legislation it will not be reached, he asked that the
                            rules be suspended and the bill read the second time now.</p>

                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY raised the question as to whether any amendment proposed to

                            General Assembly, and cited section 2 of article XVI, in support of the
                            position that no amendment to the Constitution could be proposed at this
                            time.</p>

                                        House bill No. 47 has been, from a mistake of the facts,
                                        understood by the House to be amended by the Senate, when
                                        the fact is it was not amended by this body; therefore, <hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> that a committee of three be
                                        appointed by this Senate to act with a committee of three on
                                        the part of the House, for the purpose of inquiring into the
                                        facts as to whether said bill was amended by the Senate.</p>

                        <p>Mr. O. thought there was not a Senator upon this floor who would have the
                            hardihood to contend that the bill referred to was ever-amended in the
                            Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT undertook to say that no. one can show that this body ever
                            made an, amendment to the House bill No. 47. Simply concurring in the
                            report does not adopt a law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB declared the tampering with this bill clown right forgery; and
                            denounced the guilty party in no measured terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER also denounced it as an outrage; and insisted on the passage of
                            his resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN was of opinion that this bill has been so entangled for the
                            purpose of defeating it; and counselled the getting of it back in such a
                            shape as will secure its ultimate passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON insisted that according to the custom of concurring in
                            committee reports - as practiced last session, amendments to the bill H.
                            R. 47 were adopted by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, read from the BREVIER LEGISLATIVE REPORTS of last
                            session to sustain the record as found in the Senate journal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER withdrew his resolution:</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY offered the following:</p>

                                    <p><hi rend="i">Resolved</hi>, That the Secretary of the Senate
                                        inform the House that House bill No. 47 was passed by the
                                        Senate as it came from the House, without any amendment
                                        thereof, and that if any amendment was believed by the House
                                        to have been made by the Senate, such belief was unfounded,
                                        and that the senate regards the said bill as having legally
                                        passed both branches as the same was when it passed the
                                        House, and in that form will become a law on being signed by
                                        the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate, and
                                        approved by the Governor.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CASON moved to amend the resolution by requesting the House to return
                            the bill to the Senate after it has reconsidered its action.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BENNETT this amendment was laid on the table by yeas 27,
                            nays 19.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN read a copy of the message from the Senate to the House
                            announcing the passage of the bill; and gave a histosy of the matter
                            from first to last;</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES said that he was of opinion that the amendments reported by the
                            Committee at the last session were adopted, but that they were
                            subsequently, waived. The bill, as all Senators will remember, was
                            passed without the amendments, and he thought the statements contained
                            in the resolution of the Senator from Ohio substantially correct. He
                            voted for the bill reluctantly as a cltoice of evils, and had not yet
                            changed his opinion. Some Senators think that the bill will lead to
                            great frauds. It is true that the commissioners can act fraudulently,
                                <pb n="192" xml:id="VAA8558-08-192"/> and he regretted that the bill
                            could not have been better guarded; but the State must employ agents to
                            transact its business, and he voted for the bill with the hope of having
                            the Sinking Fund invested at the earliest practicable moment in our
                            State bonds - not as a means of corruption, but to get it put of the way
                            of being a corruption fraud, as it is liable to be while remaining in
                            the coffers of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to amend by adding to the resolution a provision that it
                            be sent to the Governor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA demanded the previous question. and under its operation the
                            amendment was agreed to, and the resolution as amended was adopted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                                Business</orgName>, returned the bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_125">H. R. 125</ref>, to amend sections one
                            and two of An Act re-locating county seats, with amendments providing
                            that "no such removal or re-location shall be made unless the same
                            is removed at least three miles from its then loca-cation," and
                            striking from section two the word "general" before the word
                            "election," and inserting in lieu the word
                            "congressional."</p>
                        <p>The amendments were agreed to, and the bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NOYES moved to amend by inserting after the word
                            "consider," in the first proviso, the words "<hi rend="i">prima facie</hi> evidence of."</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN this amendment was laid oh the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NOYES moved further to amend by adding to the second section a
                            proviso that any portion of legal voters of said county may remonstrate
                            at any time before final action of the Board, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mr. N. said the only object of this amendment was to give parties
                            remonstrating against the change, the same advantage with regard to
                            evidence before the Board, as to who are legal voters., as the
                            petitioners have. He merely proposed to put them upon an exact equality
                            in that respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ENGLISH was satisfied that the bill contains a provision in exact
                            accordance with the amendment, but to satisfy everybody he hoped the
                            amendment would be adopted.</p>
                        <p>There is a contention between lawyers on this question - they don't
                            seem to understand it themselvesand in order to make it plain, so
                            everybody can understand it, he hoped the amendment would be agreed
                            to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN. The bill provides exactly as is proposed in the amendment,
                            and therefore he moved to lay it on the table.</p>
                        <p>The motion was rejected by yeas 19, nays 29.</p>

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            afternoon, viz: Mr. Dunning's bill, S. No. 40, establishing an
                            Agricultural College at Bloomington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Richmond in the Chair) withdrew his pending amendment by
                            way of substitute, striking out from the enacting clause; in order to
                            let the question come directly on the original bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULVER moved to amend by striking out the words "Monroe
                            county" and "Bloomington" and "Indiana
                            University" wherever they occur and inserting appropriately a
                            provision that the Trustees and Governor shall locate the college in
                            Tippecanoe county upon condition that 160 acres of land, &amp;c., is
                            ceded to the State, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING demanded a division of the question. Without entering into a
                            full discussion of the question he called the attention of the Senate to
                            the object Congress had In view when making the munificent grant of
                            lands to the several States for the purpose of establishing colleges to
                            promote agriculture and the mechanic arts. He reviewed the several
                            propositions made to this Legislature for the location of the college in
                            this State; and urged earnestly and at length the paramount advantages
                            that would be secured to the entire State by its location as proposed in
                            the bill before the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA thon took the floor and spoke at length; referring in no very
                            flattering terms to the county of Wayne, from whence comes one of the
                            propositions bidding for the location of the State Agricultural College.
                            He declared his preference for Tippecanoe county over and above any
                            other, and extolled the natural and other advantages of that locality;
                            closing with a glowing description of the Tippecanoe Battle Ground,
                            which he hoped would be the site selected by the better judgment of this
                            Legislature for the permanent location of the Indiana Agricultural
                            College.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT was in favor of accepting the Wayne county proposition; and
                            replied to the reflections on that comity just indulged in by the
                            Senator from Vigo, though, he contended, she needed no defense, for in
                            everything that goes to make up the prosperity of a county, old Wayne
                            stands pre-eminent. No other county can compare with her in wealth,
                            intelligence, loyalty, patriotism, agriculture, and indeed everything
                            that goes to make life desirable. When he had concluded - </p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLERobtained the floor, but gave way for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING, on whose motion, the further consideration of this subject
                            was postponed till to-morrow morning 10 o'clock, and made the
                            special order for that hour. And then the Senate adjourned.</p>

                        <p>The special order coming up, viz: the consideration of Mr Buskirk's
                            Agricultural College bill. No. 6, and the substitute therefor, reported
                            by the special committee on that subject - locating said College at
                            Bloommgton, in connection with the Indiana University - the pending
                            question being on Mr. Sim's motion to strike out
                            "Bloomington," and insert "Richmond" in lieu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH said he was neither for plaintiff nor defendant in this
                            question of location - he was for the people. He submitted the question
                            whether an institution of this kind can stand alone without the
                            fostering care of some other institution? He did not know whether he was
                            competent to decide. He doubted the practicability of a College to teach
                            practical agriculture and the mechanic arts exclusively. But if he could
                            be satisfied that this College could stand alone, he would be in favor
                            of its location anywhere else than in connection with another
                            institution; otherwise he should go the other way. The choice of
                            locations in his mind wa's between the Battle Ground and
                            Bloomington. The latter was most accessible, provided you wanted to make
                            it central. So far,it had preference over Bloomington, leaving out the
                            literary advantages of the latter place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE had no great concern about location. He was opposed to attaching
                            this to any other institution. He also considered that the choice was
                            between Bloomington and the Battleground. The latter location had the
                            advantage of historic memories, and of being near the greatest railroad
                            center in the State except Indianapolis. He described its superior
                            advantages as to soil. He considered that the endowment of this
                            institution would prove sufficient for its independent establishment and
                            support. It would yield a revenue of $15,000 a year, which would
                            certainly sustain four teachers. He reasoned at length in favor of
                            making it an independent Institution. Agriculture was the normal
                            condition of man. It would be diverting this endowment from its original
                            purpose to tack this college upon some other institution. He was
                            unwilling to admit that the profession of agriculture was inferior to
                            any other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS could hardly express any preference as to location. He rather
                            thought Indianapolis possessed superior advantages,though it had been
                            but indifferently referred to as desirable by the people here. He
                            thought it was the purpose of the donation to make this college an
                            independent institution. He supposed its course of instruction would not
                            be confined to agriculture and the mechanic arts. He supposed it would
                            thorough in the natural sciencessuch as to make practical men. As for
                            the Owen Cabinet, it could be obtained, he supposed, as well for any
                            other location as for Bloomington. He preferred the Battleground.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGG said he had but very little confidence in the success of this
                            institution. Early in the last session he had introduced a joint
                            resolution for the dwersion of the proceeds of this. Congressional
                            donation and its application to the erection of a Soldiers' Home.
                            He had some knowledge of an effort to establish such an institution at
                            College Hill, Ohio. Their object there was to make practical farmers at
                            College. They failed. The reason was that the majority of students cared
                            nothing about agriculture. They could not get students in agriculture.
                            He submitted this fact to show that this institution could not stand
                            alone. The model farm would fail, and the college would fail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE. Was this Ohio college connected with a literary
                            institution?</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGG No sir; and that is why it failed; and he understood that a
                            similar institution on a larger scale had failed in the State of New
                            York for the same reason. He reasoned at length against the utility of a
                            model farm. The grape and the fruit that might flourish in the soil
                            about the Battle Ground, might die out in hills along the Ohio river.
                            The elements of agriculture might be acquired at College, but the
                            practice must be on the farm at home. It was so of practical life in
                            every department. You could not teach stock farming by manipulations on
                            the black board. Fertilizers of the soil in one locality would fail in
                            another. He contended that this institution must be engrafted on
                            another, or it would fail for want of students.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK took a position in favor of locating this institution at
                            the Battle Ground, on account of accessibility, soil, scenery, and
                            historical associations; and there was more go-a-head in the people
                            north of the National Road. He dwelt on the advantages to the farmer of
                            such an institution. Why, a man had need to go to school to learn how to
                            make even a rail fence. Bloomington was a finished off old town; and
                            there was not a professor in the Indiana University that knew anything
                            about practical agriculture. He had seen there a dried alligator, and
                            birds, snipes, snails and snakes, but these were not essential elements
                            in the training of a practical farmer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY was in favor of locating the college at the most accessible
                            point, and the nost favorable to the agricultural interests. He
                            submitted considerations against the allegation that the institution
                            could not stand alone. He favored the Battle Ground because of its
                            historical associations, its accessibility, its soil, and because it was
                            a new place, and devoid of the fogyisms of such places as
                            Bloomington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM was an earnest advocate of educational interests - always
                            voting for the largest educational facilities. He had experience of the
                            heart-yearnings of the farmer boy for development, and that which gives
                            inspiration and efficiency to genius. All must have development, in all
                            that belongs to business life. It was not the profession that made the
                            man, but it was education - culture. Agriculture was the true natural
                            sphere of development in all that pertains to the dignity and utility of
                            life. If you do not go to Bloomington with this College, attach it to
                            some other literary institution. The culture in school was like an
                            apprenticeship in the shop. It was development of the power to think.
                            That was all there is of the schools. The intellect should <pb n="195" xml:id="VAA8558-08-195"/>be developed with varied studies. He
                            alleged the fact that an Agricultural College could not stand alone:
                            because, as it had been alleged, that its students would be outranked by
                            professional students; and this was to undervalue farmers as a class, -
                            a thing which he was by no means prepared to admit or allow. He answered
                            the objection to Bloomington, because the professors there were not
                            practical farmers. He proposed to attach this College to the University,
                            and make it a department of that institution. He lamented the
                            dissemination, the division of the educational power of the State. He
                            would have all the colleges in the State brought together into one
                            University, so that our people need not send their sons to the schools
                            of Europe to give them a finished education. He would not give a
                            farthing for the model farm in connection with this college. No manual
                            labor school ever did succeed - nor ever would; they were humbugs,
                            invended to squander money. Bloomington was the only free, independent
                            institution of learning we have, and he would turn all the educational
                            patronage and power of the State in that direction, and build up a
                            University there that would be in all respects creditable to the
                            North-west.</p>

                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, obtained leave to introduce A bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_320">H. R. No. 320</ref>] for an act to
                            regulate swinging bridges across the several rivers, feeder dams in this

                        <p>The House resumed the consideration of Mr. Buskirk's Agricultural
                            College bill. No. 6, and the substitute amendment thereto reported by a
                            majority of the Select Committee thereon - the pending question being on
                            Mr. Sim's motion to strike out "Bloomington" and insert
                            "Richmond."</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS was satisfied that this question could not be settled in its
                            present shape, because it was a triangular fight. He proposed that the
                            House go into Committee of the Whole and institute an informal vote so
                            as either to agree on a location, or reduce the question to a decision
                            between two points.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB indicated another plan, to refer the bill to a Commission, to
                            receive propositions for donations for 90 days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM objected to the latter plan, because the people of Marion county
                            could offer the largest pecuniary considerations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD said it was not necessary to recommit, as Bloomington was the
                            only place where we could locate this institution in the prescribed
                            time, and put it into wrorking order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FOULKE referred to the proposition for a donation of $100,000 from
                            Wayne county. He complained that the Committee directed to inquire into
                            this matter of a location at the regular session, did not visit Wayne
                            county. He stated that this Wayne county donation was $100,000 in
                            moneynot in property at exorbitant valuations. He summed up the
                            donations from the Battle Ground and from Stockwell in Tippecanoe county
                            - the first was $48,000, and the latter was $33,000, making a total of
                            $81,000. The donation from Bloomington was $50,000, so neither
                            Tippecanoe or Monroe had offered the substantial inducements that had
                            come from Wayne county, which the Committee of Examination last session
                            entirely ignored. The people of Wayne county did not claim pre-eminence
                            in the State, but they did claim that they have offered inducements for
                            this location outweighing all others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVEY considered the reasons urged for the Bloomington location,
                            combatting the allegation that an Agricultural College could not stand
                            disconnected from a literary and classical school. He said: locate this
                            college anywhere else but in connection with the Indiana University,
                            which never had been, and never could be made a success. To say that
                            this institution could not stand alone was to pay a poor compliment to
                            the great minds of the country that conceived these magnificent
                            donations of land for an Agricultural College in every State in the
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT stood ready to do what he judged best to advance the
                            educational interests of the State. He was in favor of making the
                            location at Bloomington. He answered objections to placing this college
                            in connection with another institution, and gave considerations in favor
                            of a liberal education to the agriculturalists of the State, defending
                            the school and the teachers at Bloomington. The battle-ground, as
                            regards its historical renown as a battle-field, was played out. There
                            were hundreds of skirmish fields that were its superior in all that
                            makes matter for history.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS was never in favor of accepting this grant; but now it is
                            accepted, the question was, what is best to be done with it. His first
                            precaution in this matter was to avoid expense in connection with it,
                            after the manner we have been called upon for appropriations for the
                            Northern Prison. And he thought he could see that the Bloomington
                            location promised the least expense. He gave reasons for his conclusion,
                            that this college could never be a success. The only hope of its success
                            was in its connection with the State University. These considerations
                            decided his mind for Bloomington, - which had no claim but this above
                            any other location that had been named.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS gave general views as to the character of the course of
                            instruction that ought to be commended to the people of the State. He
                            objected to limitations as to just how much a man shall know - just what
                            course of instruction he shall taketo make him an accomplished citizen,
                            farmer or mechanic. He would connect the Agricultural College with the
                            State University, where the sons of the State could receive culture
                            without stint, as becomes a free people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Hamrick in the Chair) seing indications of a demand for
                            the previous question, sent up an amendment as a substitute for the
                            amendment of the Select Committee.</p>
                        <p>It requires the Governor to appoint a Commission, <pb n="196" xml:id="VAA8558-08-196"/> consisting of five discreet persons from
                            several divisions of the State, well acquainted with agricultural and
                            mechanical industry, who shall be qualified by oath faithfully to
                            discharge their duties as such Commissioners, who shall proceed, upon
                            personal examination of the premises, to fix the location of the Indiana
                            Agricultural College, provided by act of March 6, 1865, subject to the
                            following conditions: <list type="ordered">
                                <item n="1">The location, healthy, accessible, etc.</item>
                                <item n="2">There shall be donated for the purposes of the college a
                                    grant of land not less than one hundred acres, of undoubted
                                    title, with suitable buildings, or agreements with reference to
                                    buildings, thereon, which shall at the time, by a fair
                                    valuation, be worth $100.000.</item>
                            </list> This the said Commissioners shall be authorized to receive and
                            hold in the name of the State of Indiana, and make report thereof to the
                            Governor and the Trustees of the Indiana College.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. Hardly a measure that had been presented to this General
                            Assepbly deserved more consideration than this. The details of the bill
                            were likely to be neglected, while we were considering merely the
                            question of location. He was not prepared to decide on the question of
                            location. This question could not be wisely decided without going
                            actually upon the ground for the purpose. Therefore he had proposed that
                            the Governor shall appoint a commission of competent persons to
                            determine this question for us. Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, who prepared
                            the bill for the act of Congress granting these munificent donations of
                            land, purposed the establishment of great independent schools,
                            disconnected entirely from all other istitutions. At the last session
                            here we had acted wisely; we had accepted the grant and established an
                            agricultural college, and he read the names of the trustees in tlie
                            charter. The bill now before the House proposed to modify this charter
                            so as to make this college a part of another institution, against the
                            pledge of the good name of the State, in the act of last session that we
                            would establish a separate institution. The allegations that an
                            Agricultural College could not stand alone might furnish a good reason
                            against receiving the Congressional grant; but now it was accepted, it
                            was no good argument that we should divert this fund from the purpose
                            for vvhich it has been ottered and accepted. He objected to the details
                            of the bill in the matter of the assignment of the land script to the
                            Trustees. The Trustees would have 390,000 acres of land worth, say,
                            $390,000. The taxes upon this land would become a charge upon the State
                            of an annual expense, not less than $7,000 or $8,000. Then there was the
                            expense of locating these lands - the three Commissioners and the
                            Trustees all receiving traveling expenses and $5 a day for the time
                            employed. Then the management of land a land office of twenty years
                            standing could not be got along with, for less than $3,000 a year. Then
                            the lands were not to be sold for less than a dollar an acre - the
                            purchaser to pay six per cent, on the purchase. Then if the purchasers
                            do not pay promptly, these Commissioners are to declare forfeitures. A
                            novelty in law. Did not the gentleman know that the matter of
                            forfeitures would be regulated by the laws of Missouri, or of the State
                            where the lands may be located? Then the bill provides for a College
                            Report to be made annually to the Governor, which the Governor is to
                            cause to be printed, at an expense of probable $3,000 or $4,000 more.
                            Thus he showed up an annual expense involved in the passage of this bill
                            of about $12,000, merely to set up this school and put it in
                            operationmaking us by so much the poorer than we might have been had we
                            never accepted this grant. Upon the question of location, manifestly the
                            best way to get at that was by a commission as he had proposed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE suggested that the power of of location be conferred upon the
                            Trustees incorporated at the last session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT said that would answer his mind about the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK replied first to Mr. Pettit. The gentleman assumed that the
                            scrip could not be assigned to the Trustees and by them laid upon the
                            lands. He controverted this by reference to the donation Act of
                            Congress, providing that no State shall locate this land with in the
                            borders of another State, for the reason that one sovereignty should not
                            own land within the borders of another sovereignty, but the Act provides
                            that the State's agent may make this location for the State,
                            provided that not more than one million of acres shall be located in any
                            one State. He then read the Acting Governor's recommendation of
                            such assignment, in one of his late special messages. The State of Rhode
                            Island had already made the location of her Agricultural College land,
                            by assignment of her scrip. He then referred to the gentleman's
                            allegation that it was the purpose of the author of the bill (Mr.
                            Morrill) to establish purely an Agricultural College.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT stated that it was the purpose Congress to make it distinctly
                            ancl singly an Agricultural College.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK responded by reading the 4th section of the act. Mr. B. said
                            he did not regard the bill as at all perfect in its details, and when
                            the location shall be made, he would himself move that the bill be
                            recommitted for general revision. But the gentlemen wanted to sell the
                            land script. Mr. B. showed that by the report of the Trustees, this land
                            could not be sold for more that fifty or sixty cents an acre. Now if the
                            land can not be sold, what was the value of the script? Purely
                            Agricultural Colleges were failures in Europe, as well as in this
                            country - there had been failures in New York, Ohio, and Michigan, as he
                            had before stated; and the reason for this had been well represented in
                            the speeches of the gentleman from Floy'd, the gentleman from
                            Dearborn, and the gentleman from Vermillion. Young men go to school for
                            theory, and return to their farms for practical agriculture. With
                            respect to the gentleman's amendment appointing a committee to make
                            this location, he said, if the House was ready to yield themselves to
                            the guardianship of this commission, it might just as well be written
                            to-day as any day hereafter, that this college shall be at Indianapolis.
                            That would be the result of a commission. For his part, he was not
                            prepared to subordinate the judgment of the House in that way. He
                            conconcluded with a defence of some friends of the location at
                            Bloomington who had been seen in these lobbies and referred to by the
                            gentleman from Tippecanoe (Mr. Miller;) and a tribute to the Indiana
                            University at Bloomington <pb n="197" xml:id="VAA8558-08-197"/> its
                            people, soil, climate. &amp;c. When he had concluded - </p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER demanded a division of the question. He would have the first
                            question on striking out "Bloomington."Mr. SIM asked and
                            obtained leave to withdraw his amendment.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) held that the previous question
                            cuts off Mr. Pettit's amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK stated that there was a minority report locating the College
                            in Tippecanoe county.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER, The first question then was on adopting the report of the
                            minority of the special Committee.</p>
                        <p>It was rejected - yeas 37, nays 47; and the question recurred on the
                            adoption of the substitute for Mr. Buskirk's bill, No. 6, reported
                            by the majority of the special Committee, and fixing the location at
                            Bloomington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren moved to reconsider the vote by which his demand
                            for the previous question was seconded and the main question was
                            ordered. He desired to give an opportunity for Mr. Pettit to offer his
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BROWN, the motion to reconsider was laid on the
                            table.</p>

                    <p>On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of yesterday's journal was
                        dispensed with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. DYKES presented a remonstrance from the officers of a Mutual Insnranee
                        Company, of Goshen, against the passage of the bill proposing to repeal the
                        law incorporating such companies; which was referred to the

                    <p>Mr. MILLIGAN, from the <orgName>Committee on Rights and Privileges</orgName>,
                        returned the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_149">H. R. 149</ref>, to
                        amend section 6 of An Act regarding estrays and articles adrift;

                        <p>The Senate returned to the consideration of the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_125">H. R. 125</ref>, amending sections 1 and
                            2 of the re-location of county seats Act, (interrupted by the special
                            order yesterday afternoon,) the question being on the amendment [Mr.
                            Noyes'] then pending.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN was of opinion that this amendment, if adopted, would kill the
                            bill; while at the same time it would do no good, in fact or in law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD could see no objection to incorporating this amendment in the
                            bill, and insisted that it should be agreed to. The bill gives all the
                            advantages to those petitioning for removal, and unless this amendment
                            is adopted he should vote against the entire measure.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT'S opinion, as a constitutional lawyer, (laughter) sided
                            with the Senator from Bartholomew [Mr. Hord.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB thought the amendment would amount to nothing, and that the
                            proposition of the Senator from Bartholomew wras untenable. He therefore
                            opposed the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES was not able, from hearing the bill read, to give an
                            intelligent vote upon it, and to better satisfy his own mind, and
                            probably the minds of others, he moved to refer the bill with the
                            pending amendment to the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN objected, whereupon - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES withdrew his motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY should vote against the amendment with a view to offering one
                            which he had drawn up since last evening., and which he read. [It is
                            printed below.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. NOYES renewed the motion to refer the bill and pending amendments to
                            the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. CULLEN, the motion to refer was laid on the table by

                        <p>The amendment was then rejected by yeas 10, nays 35.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY moved to further amend the bill by adding to section 2 the

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            morning, viz: Mr. Dunning's bill, S. No. 40, establishing an
                            Agricultural College at Bloomington. A division of the question on Mr.
                            Culver's amendment having been demanded yesterday, the first
                            question will be on striking out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER spoke some time in response to the address of the Senator from
                            Vigo [Mr. Hanna] delivered yesterday afternoon; and then referred to the
                            matter before the Senate. He did not think our selection of a location
                            for the Agricultural College should be confined to the three places
                            which have already set up bids there, for while he was not prepared to
                            say at which point it would be better for the college to be located, he
                            did say it was a matter of very great importance and should be well
                            considered by Senators before casting their votes. His present feelings
                            were in favor of locating it where the largest donation can be obtained
                            all other things being equal.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. NILES the further consideration of the subject was
                            postponed till two o'clock this afternoon.</p>

                            disposition of lots, streets, alleys, public squares and grounds within
                            the corporate limits of any incorporated city heretofore vacated or
                            hereafter vacated; was taken from the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. A. explained. The bill provides that where streets or alleys are
                            vacated the property shall belong to the owners on either side; where
                            lots are vacated tiiey revert to the original owners, and where public
                            blocks are vacated they go back to the county or town.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES said the bill was gotten up by a committee at the suggestion of
                            a resolution offered by himself, and which will be found printed on page

                            and insisting that it would be the <pb n="199" xml:id="VAA8558-08-199"/>
                            most perfect plan yet proposed to carry out the evident designs of
                            Congress in making the grant of lands to the several States and
                            Territories.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER made an ineffectual motion - yeas 20; nays 20 - to lay the
                            resolution on the table.</p>
                        <p>Some eight or nine Senators then proposed amendments, adding as many
                            diiferent colleges to those named in the resolution; which were
                            humorously adopted by consent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD spoke in opposition to any and every proposition looking to a
                            diversion of this fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB had a preference for the location of this college but did not
                            deem it necessary to express it at this time. He thought this fund ought
                            not to be distributed, and hoped an early vote would be taken on the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. HORD, the resolution as amended, was laid on the table
                            by yeas 44, nays 3.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said that Marion County had not yet appeared as a bidder for
                            the location of this Agricultural College, not because of any
                            indisposition to take an active part in the matter, but because, having
                            many of the public building already fixed within her limits, she feared
                            it would create prejudice in the minds of those from a distance; and it
                            might be thought Marion County wished to monopolize the State
                            institutions. But he would say she was prepared, and could and would
                            give as much as any other County in the State to secure the
                            location.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING then presented additional considerations in favor of the
                            location of this college at Bloomington; and earnestly announced his
                            conviction that the connecting of such an institution with the State
                            University would be conducive to the public interests of the entire
                            commonwealth. He opposed the proposition for a commission to receive
                            bids for the location; and compared it to the manner in which the
                            Northern Peniteniiary was located some years ago. The people of Indiana
                            are surprised that we have been so derelect of our duty as not to have
                            made the location before this time. He also opposed the idea of dividing
                            this agricultural college fund and thereby defeating the object of
                            Congress in making this munificent grant. When he had concluded - </p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK gave reasons why we should not be in haste in making this
                            location; and spoke in favor of the appointment of a Commission which
                            could take advantage of the competition already commenced. The
                            Congressional donation will come to the State in the shape of land
                            scrip, and that must be sold, and we must wait for accrued interest on
                            money so realized before we can commence to operate the institution.
                            Then why be in such haste to select a location?</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN of Wells, the further consideration of this
                            subject was postponed till 2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. VAWTER, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of</p>

                        <p>Mr. C. explained that, though his bill raised the fees of County

                            pay them for the figures made on scraps of paper, as now is done in many
                            counties under the present law; and because of this provision, it will
                            reduce the Auditor's fees in more counties than it raises it.</p>

                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi> announced the lonsideration of
                            the special order, viz: the State Debt bills <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. No. 285</ref> and S. No. 279.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, from a minority of the Special Committee on the subject of
                            the State Debt, submitted a report dissenting from the majority report
                            presented this morning; recommending passage of the bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref> and that the bill S. No.
                            279 be laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANDEY spoke in favor of the conclusions made in the majority
                            report. He urged Senators to stand by the financial integrity of the
                            State under any and all circumstances; and insisted that the bill S. No.
                            279 would preserve the credit of the State both at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN occupied the attention of the Senate, speaking for the bill
                            section No. 279. He could come to no other conclusion than that there
                            can be no more honorable manner of adjusting our debt than the plan
                            proposed in this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN contended that the bill originating in the Senate is the one
                            that ought to pass. In his humble judgment the House bill would not
                            adjust the debt at all; it was objectionable from beginning to end while
                            the Senate bill would save to the State over a half a million of
                            dollars.</p>

                        <p>Mr. VAWTER stood against the majority report, for he would support no
                            proposition which does not provide for the accumulation of a fund to
                            discharge the State debt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER obtained the floor, but gave way for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD, on whose motion, the further consideration of the question was
                            postponed till 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.</p>

                            Lasselle and Miller.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Select Committee to which was referred the special
                            message of the Acting Governor, transmitting the communication of the
                            Surgeon General of the United States Army, together with the transfer of
                            the Jeffersonville Hospital to the State of Indiana, reported two
                            concurrent resolutions in relation to the transfer of the United States
                            Hospital at Jeffersonville to the State of Indiana.</p>
                        <p>Mr. N. explained that the first resolution authorizes the Lieutenant
                            Governor to accept the hospital. The second provides, that until the
                            State shall assume the care of disabled soldiers and seamen there, the
                            Acting Governor may authorize any private association to take charge of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. This matter was of considerable importance. Unless a
                            Soldiers' Home were established, he was opposed to the acceptance.
                            The committee should have made their report upon the other matters which
                            were referred to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The officers of the Government leased this farm near
                            Jelfersonville at $2,975 a year, which expires the 13th of June, this
                            year. He objected not to receiving these buildings; but how were we to
                            get possession? If we had possession, we could not hold longer than the
                            13th ot June. If we got this farm (117 acres and a half,) must we not
                            pay the rent, lacking but $25 of the $3,000 a year?</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. Is the Government required to remove the buildings?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The Government have the right of removing them at the
                            expiration of the lease. He would bring up a copy of the lease this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained again. We had here in this city an hospital
                            transferred to an association, caring for many disabled soldiers. The
                            city charges them no rent. This same association could take this
                            hospital of the State, and occupy it for the care of the disabled. The
                            United States Government give these buildings to the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM was in favor of accepting the property and turning it over for
                            the benefit of soldiers'. But he was opposed to Soldiers'
                            Homes, as he was to Agricultural Manual Labor Colleges. The man that has
                            been a good soldier wants the amenities of social life = has all the
                            generous and noble feelings of human nature, and dislikes confinement
                            and the restraints of a hospital</p>
                        <p>.Mr. NEWCOMB. In France there was no more popular institution than the
                            Hotel des Invalides.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM said there was a difference between society in Europe and
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. COFFROTH and Mr. MILLER gave instances of the
                            benevolence extended to invalid and suffering soldiers by <pb n="201" xml:id="VAA8558-08-201"/> the proprietors of the Soldiers' Home
                            near this city, - the Sanitary Commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. We ought to accept this grant of the Government. If the
                            buildings were not removed, they would follow the realty; but the State
                            might dispose of these buildings for the benefit of invalid soldiers.
                            The acceptance should be made at once.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL. It was the State's duty to provide for disabled
                            soldiers. But we should always know the responsibilities we take upon
                            ourselves. This might be an arrangement by which we would lose more than
                            we would gain.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY of Warren demanded the previous question, which was seconded,
                            and the main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>The concurrent resolution was then adopted.</p>
                        <p>After some general conversation across the House, the vote was
                            reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BUBWELL, the subject was laid on the table.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS introduced a concurrent resolution instructing our Senators

                            lands to the States and Territories of the United States, which shall
                            provide Colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,

                            go into another State and levy and hold lands. It was preposterous. The
                            matter desired in the resolution could be accomplished under the
                            existing act.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said the State of Indiana held land in Georgia for a number
                            of years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS moved to amend by striking out "six" and inserting
                            "three" years' time for selling the land. He knew
                            something of the hardships endured in a new country by large tracts of
                            land being taken up and held by non-residents.</p>
                        <p>No quorum voting on this amendment - the roll-call determined a
                            quorum,and then the amendment was rejected - affirmative 8, negative
                            75.</p>
                        <p>The concurrent resolution was then adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN introduced a bill [H. R. No. 323] for an act to amend the third
                            section of the act to allow County Commissioners to authorize turnpike
                            road companies, where three-fourths of the persons owning real estate
                            along the line of the proposed road shall petition for the same, and to
                            levy a tax for its construction, and provide that the same shall be
                            free.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER laid before the House a message from the Acting Governor,
                            transmitting a copy of the report of Joseph E. McDonald, Commissioner to
                            investigate the Stover frauds on the 2 1/2 and 5 per cent. bonds of the
                            State, recommending that the matter suggested by the Commissioner be
                            referred to the appropriate committee, and that the Commissioner be
                            heard before the committee.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, the communication was referred to the
                                <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>, with instructions to
                            incorporate into the specific appropriation bill the amount of the
                            account stated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE (being requested so to do, introduced a bill [H. R. No. 324]
                            for an act to authorize changes of venue from the Common Pleas to the

                        <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on the Judiciary</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLEASON introduced a bill [H. R. No. 325] for an act to amend
                            sections 16 and 17 of the act authorizing the construction of levees
                            and.drains, approved June 12, 1852, and subjecting towns and
                            incorporated cities to assessments; and declaring an emergency.</p>
                        <p>It was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Swamp Lands</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM gave notice of an amendment of rule 54, so as to terminate
                            the morning hour at 10 o'clock, instead of 11 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS called up his special committee bill, (reported this
                            morning,) H. R. No. 326, for an act to apportion Senators and
                            Representatives for the State of Indiana, and it was passed to the

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved for the consideration of bills of the House on the
                            second reading, and it was so ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Buskirk's Agricultural College bill, No.6, coming up - </p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. Buskirk, it was postponed, and made the special order
                            for 2 o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Branham's bill, No. 95, to enable railroads to alter their lines
                            in certain cases, coming up with an amendment of the <orgName>Committee
                                on Corporations</orgName>, subjecting them to the payment of
                            damages, etc. - </p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS proposed to amend the amendment by a provision, that
                            railroads proposing to change their route for one mile or more shall,
                            previous to such change, pay the owners'of real estate from which
                            said track is proposed to be taken all damages that may be sustained
                            thereby.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM would acquiese in the amendment if he understood it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK thought the bill, as it is, secured the rights contemplated.
                            If it did not he would vote for the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS said his people would be largely injured if their road
                            (though not the best in the State) were taken away from them. They had
                            paid dearly for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART said, the substance of Mr. Higgins' amendment was
                            embraced in the Committee's amendent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS said his amendment required damages to be paid previous to
                            the re-moval.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to attach Mr. Higgins' amendment by the words
                            "and provided."</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to, and then Mr. Higgins' amendment was adopted; and
                            the amendment as amended was adopted. The bill failed on the final
                            reading in the House of Representatives - yeas 50, nays 35 for want of a
                            constitutional majority of 51.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HUMPHREYS explained that it simply fixes the fees of the printer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM suggested that it left out the provision of law which requires
                            an advertisement in the newspaper nearest the land to be sold.</p>
                        <p>The bill was rejected - yeas 28, nays 51.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS, Mr. CHURCH and others explained that this appropriation
                            would make no difference as to the expense to the State. It would be
                            charged to the stationery account of members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY said the resolution did not reach the case.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, proposed to substitute the following:</p>

                        <p>After some conversation across the House, the substitute was adopted,
                            modified so as to read "$ 200" instead of

                        <p>On motion by Mr. BUSKIRK, it was ordered that Mr. Olleman's Railroad

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM moved to suspend the order of business, and take up his bill,
                            No. 312, for abolishing the Board Sinking Fund Commissioners, and
                            transferring their business to the Auditor and Treasurer of State; and

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM proposed to amend the bill, by adding two sections, the

                        <p>Mr. Goodman's bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_237">H. R. No

                            1865, [by which school meetings may direct that a greater or less number
                            of branches may be taught,] coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL was anxious for this provision to be incorporated into the
                            act of last session at the time of its consideration, but his amendments
                            were rejected. His mind was now changed, and he would support the
                            provision of law which requires physiology and history as qualifications
                            for a common school teacher.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES. As the law stands, a large number of districts have to go
                            without teachers. There were some teachers claiming to be competent in
                            physiology, who were wholly without qualification for keeping school in
                            other respects.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS. The bill did not strike out physiology or any other ology as a
                            teachers' qualification, but merely gave a discretion to the
                            districts as to teachers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS would prefer to suspend the law for a time than to make this
                            modification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the previous question, and under its operation the

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the special order; viz: the Agricultural College
                            bill, H. R. No. 6, the pending question being on the substitute
                            amendment of Mr. Speaker Pettit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT( Mr. Henricks in the Chair) desired to amend his substitute
                            for the bill submitted yesterday afternoon, by inserting at the close of
                            the second condition of location to this effect: "But such location
                            shall not be finally fixed by such commissioners until such grant,
                            donation or agreement shall have been first made complete by conveyance
                            or delivery, nor shall any agreement in regard to buildings or property
                            be accepted by them without adequate freehold security."</p>

                        <p>This proposition was to make this location better than we can do it, -
                            which requires local knowledge and comparison. A Commission could
                            determine a location upon actual examination and comparison, much better
                            than we. We ought to be well satisfied that everything donated should be
                            well warranted before the State is bound in the case. If the particular
                            locations, whose Mends were clamoring for patronage here, could not

                            the location. His proposition was a continuation of the legislation
                            taken last winter on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD opposed the amendment. He saw here a proposition for a
                            commission, to act as guardian of the General Assembly, which would not
                            result more creditably than the Commission to locate the Northern
                            Prison, He repeated that we had not time for the circumlocation involved
                            in this amendment</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM demanded the previous question, and under its force - (after

                        <p>On motion by Mr. OLLEMAN, the House took up bills on the third
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. McVey's bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_117">H. R. No.
                                117</ref>] to amend sections 39, 42, 45 and 54, of the act for the
                            incorporation of Insurance Companies, &amp;c., approved June 17, 1852,
                            coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained that it was a law to amend the present statutes in
                            regard to Mutual Insurance Companies. It requires $50,000 in premium
                            notes before the Company can go into operation. This will give solvency
                            to every new Company. Secondly: The party may pay cash instead of a
                            premium note. Thirdly. Instead of distribution every five years, the
                            earnings shall be added to the stock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said, the provision doing away with premium notes would
                            command his vote; so that when a man takes a policy he knows precisely
                            what he has to pay.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHURCH. He would vote for a bill declaring that every traveling
                            insurance agent shall get out of the State. He thought he saw an
                            opportunity here for deception of the people. He gave examples.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said the purpose of this bill was to provide against the
                            defects of the existing lawto place these companies on a more permanent
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. If there was wild-cat anywhere, it was to be found in this
                            bill. Every stock Holder holds his own premium note, and a $50,000 pile
                            of these notes contributes all the security which these mutual insurance
                            companies propose to losers. Then by a provision of the bill, these
                            mutual insurance companies may, by a trick of legerdemain, change their
                            character into that of stock companies, without making the deposits, as
                            required by existing law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL denounced Mutual Insurance Companies as systematized
                            swindling. This bill might by amending the system give it character. He
                            was opposed to giving the system any shadow of respectability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS thought this bill was worse than the old law. It gave to the
                            Mutual Insurance agents power to twist themselves into a position where
                            they can play the double part of mutual and stock companies: and gave
                            their agents power to run away with all the money the poor man has,
                            instead of taking only five per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB defended the provisions of the bill. It would make the people
                            ten times more secure than they now are against these companies. The
                            provision that the stockholder may pay money instead of his premium
                            note, was a common feature in all insurance companies. Then it provides
                            that the cash accumulations shall be added to its capital till it
                            amounts to $100,000, to pay losses. The 2d section would secure the
                            State against the organization of a single bogus company.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES demanded the previous question, and, under its force, the bill
                            was passed the House - yeas 59, nays 28.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, it was ordered that when the House

                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, now called up the special order, viz: the
                            consideration of his negro school bill [H. R. No. 208] the question
                            being on adopting the substitute as reported by the special committee,
                            entitled as follows: "An act to amend an act entitled an act to
                            provide a general system of common schools, etc., approved May 6, .1865,
                            and also an act supplemental thereto, providing for the separate
                            enumeration of colored children, prescribing tbe duties of Township
                            Trustees in relation thereto, and declaring an emergency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the amendment by striking out the words
                            "expend their proportion of the school fund." and insert this:
                            "shall appropriate for the support and benefit of such schools all
                            the tax derived from colored persons." This would make our
                            legislation conform to the act of Congress for the regulation of colored
                            schools in the District of Columbia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. said he did not think we should go further than Congress on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB read the first section of article 8 of the Constitution
                            closing with these words: "where tuition shall be without charge
                            and equally open to all." The Constitution made no distinction; and
                            there was another provision of the Constitution prohibiting special
                            class legislation, and that all taxes shall be uniform. What did this
                            mean"all?" "all men?" all taxes? Was it not
                            classifying to provide that the blacks shall recover no more school
                            money than they pay into the fund? We were, perhaps insensibly, applying
                            the policy of the slavery legislation of tha South to the free blacks of
                            the North.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. Upon what principle then, docs the gentleman shut the doors
                            of the schools against colored children?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, We satisfy the constitutional provision, if we provide
                            common schools for them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON reasoned from the language of the 23d section of the bill of
                            rights, that the word "all," here in the constitution,
                            referred to "all citizens." The gentleman's construction
                            was not in accordance with the bill of rights. Negroes are not
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB replied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD expected to vote against this bill. He placed his justification
                            upon the constitutional provision excluding negroes from the State.</p>
                        <p>Ms. LASSELLE would oppose it for the rea-ason that the bill was proposing
                            to tax negroes, whilst they remained without representation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. We tax them now. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. They have representation plenty here. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. One violation of the Constiution can not justify another.
                            It was a breach of the great American doctrine: No taxation without
                            represention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM said there had been an effort in many places in this country
                            to set apart the school funds of the German population, and to the
                            Catholics. He thought the white man - the Catholic - just as good as the
                            negro, if he behaved himself. Why now do for the negro what the General
                            Assembly had over and over again denied to white people? Gentlemen
                            should carry this thing out squarely, as well to whites as blacks. He
                            should not so much object to the equality of the negro, as to
                            establishing an aristocracy of negro blood - or wool. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Take the bull by the horns - put them into the schools at once - and
                            let's have, the issue here, and take it to the people. The
                            constitutional argument of the gentleman from Marion admitted of no half
                            way house. But, sir, you could no more educate the negro beside the
                            white race, than you could raise the blade and the ear of corn to its
                            full maturity under tht shade of the oak. There must be perfect equality
                            in all respects, and consequent amalgamation, or the weaker race will
                            decline and dip out. The man that does not know this had read history to
                            very little purpose.</p>
                        <p>When he had concluded - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK demanded the previous question on his amendment, and under
                            its operation his amendment was adopted - yeas 45, nays 35.</p>
                        <p>And then the amendment, by the committee, as thus amended, was rejected,
                            without a division.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS moved to lay the subject on the table; but understanding that
                            the question recurred on the original bill, he withdrew the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved to indefinitely postpone the whole subject, and
                            thereupon demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The House refused to second the demand.</p>
                        <p>Pending the question to postpone indefinitely - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BURTON took the floor in a generally prepared speech agcinst the
                            bill, which will be printed hereafter. He spoke, by indulgence of the
                            House, beyond the 25 minutes limitation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS next took the floor, in support of the bill, pleading the
                            considerations of humanity and the Christian Institution. He also
                            delivered a prepared speech, which will appear in the APPENDIX to these
                            Reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WEIGHT interrogated Mr. Burton in questions implicating that
                            gentleman and his party in charging the cause of tbe war upon the people
                            of the Northern States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS submitted the following, which was read for information:</p>

                    <p>On motion by Mr. GIFFORD, the reading of yesterday's journal was
                        dispensed with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WARD, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>, returned Mr.

                    <p>Mr. TERRY, from the <orgName>Committee on Swamp Lands</orgName>, returned Mr.

                        lands where the State cannot make a good title; with amendments.</p>
                    <p>He also returned Mr. McClurg's bill, S. No. 310, amending sections 1 and
                        2 of the wet lands and drainage Act of March 7, 1863; recommending its
                        passage.</p>

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            hour, viz.: Mr. Ward's bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_219">S.
                                No. 219</ref>, defining who shall be competent witnesses in any
                            court of this State - [all persons, without distinction of color] - the
                            question beeng on concurring in the committee amendment, inserting
                            appropriately the words "or blood."</p>
                        <p>Mr. McCLURG was not in favor of this bill, but did not think it made one
                            particle of difference, as to the force the bill will have, whether this
                            amendment be adopted or not. The idea, in proposing the amendment was
                            simply to make the bill more positive in its terms - merely explanatory.
                            He expected to make opposition to the bill upon principle. It seemed
                            like fighting a man of straw to oppose this amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK could see a good deal in the amendment. It amounted to
                            something more than redundancy. He could find persons in Indianapolis
                            said to have negro blood in them, as white as he; and such persons would
                            be excluded from testifying on account of color unless this amendment
                            was made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER thought it was part of our duty to make the laws plain - so
                            that they could not be misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>The Committee amendment was then agreed to by yeas 26, nays 21 - as

                        <p>Mr. ALLISON moved to amend the amendment by adding this; "except

                            suppression of the rebellion."</p>
                        <p>This amendment was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The amendment as amended was rejected by yeas 48, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. OYLER, the vote adopting the amendment to the amendment
                            was reconsidered by yeas 26, nays 22.</p>
                        <p>Mr, YAWTER raised the point of order that this proceeding was
                            unparliamentary.</p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT decided the point of order not well taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON withdrew his amendment.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. OYLER the vote rejecting the amendment [Mr.
                            Downey's] was reconsidered by yeas 24, nays 22.</p>
                        <p>The question recurring on the adoption of the amendment - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY said the object of his amendment was to do that which a
                            provision in the 13th Art. of the State Constitution requires the
                            General Assembly to do. Instead of holding out inducements by offering
                            privileges to this class, he held it to be a duty required of this
                            General Assembly so to legislate as to discourage them from coming into
                            the State. He was in favor of allowing those colored persons who were in
                            the State at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, the right of
                            testifying in Courts of Justice; but he was opposed to extending that
                            right to any colored persons who were not here at that time, or who may
                            hereafter come here in violation of the 13th Art. of the Constitution of
                            the State.</p>

                        <p>Pending the call - </p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON, in explanation of his vote, said: I am opposed to the
                            amendment of the Senator of Ohio, excepting and not allowing negroes to
                            testify, who have come into the State in violation of the thirteenth
                            article of the Constitution. I do not mean that I would violate any
                            provision of the Constitution, but I understand that the amendment to
                            the Constitution of the United States has been adopted by a requisite
                            number of States, and it is now the fundamental law of the land. The
                            amendment of the Constitution makes negroes citizens of the State, and
                            annuls and abrogates all laws, whether constitutional or legislative,
                            restoring the liberty of this class of people, Under its provisions we
                            have no more right to prohibit a negro from coming into this State than
                            we have an Englishman. The question then arises whether we will obey the
                            Constitution of the United States, abrogating the thirteenth article of
                            our State Constitution, or obey a provision already null and void. But
                            it is evident that we can pass no law without the amendment of the
                            Senator of Ohio, and as it is better to have the law with this amendment
                            than no law, for the reason that it goes a part of the way toward doing
                            justice to this race of people, I shall vote for the amendment. I vote
                            "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN said: My speech has been made by the Senator from Boone [Mr.
                            Cason.] With that understanding I vote "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER said: Endorsing the remarks of the Senator from Boone, and for
                            the same reasons, I vote "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON in casting this vote did not wish to be considered as being
                            in favor of any Government or Constitution that abridges in any way the
                            natural rights of man; but under the circumstances, as we must have,
                            some <pb n="206" xml:id="VAA8558-08-206"/> protection, not only for
                            ourselves, but for the colored people, he should vote
                            "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK said the amendment did not cover all he wanted, but he
                            had confidence in the onward march of civilization, and believed this
                            thirteenth article would be wiped out at no distant day; and when that
                            is done this very law itself will give to all negro persons in Indiana
                            the right to testify. He voted " aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Beeson in the Chair) was in favor of the thirteenth
                            article at the time of its adoption, and had been for it ever since,
                            until he had become satisfied that the effects of this great rebellion
                            which we have just suppressed would abolish slavery, and now, although
                            he expected to follow the dictates of his judgment as to all questions
                            which may come lip in the future, he was disposed to take it in broken
                            doses. He was not prepared to go the length of other gentlemen. He voted
                            "aye."</p>
                        <p>The result of the vote was then announced as above recorded.</p>
                        <p>So the amendment was adopted.</p>

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the state debt bills <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. No. 285</ref>, and S. No. 279 -
                            the special order for this hour - the question being on
                            concurrence'in the majority report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN, although he considered the provision, in effect, already in
                            the bill S. No. 279, in order to make it more plain, moved to amend by
                            inserting in line eight, section eight, after the word "State"
                            the following: "As fast as moneys from year to year accumulate in
                            said State debt sinking fund, which said fund is irrevokably pledged for
                            the redemption of said stocks and bonds."</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER being entitled to the floor gave way for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, who, without any intention to cut off debate, moved
                            the previous question. He was convinced further debate would do no good;
                            this legislative session as drawing rapidly to a close; we have a great
                            deal of unfinished business before us, and if we consume the time in
                            useless discussion, important legislation will be defeated.</p>
                        <p>The demand for the previous question was seconded by the Senate, and
                            under its operation - </p>
                        <p>The amendment [Mr. Cullen's] was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The question recurring on concurrence in the majority report of the

                            out from the enacting clause and inserting the bill S. No. 279 in

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT moved that the bill be engrossed and read the third time

                        <p>Pending the roll call - </p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON, in explanation of his vote, said he regarded a defeat of
                            this bill as much as to say that we shall not have a bill for the
                            adjustment of the State debt during the session. There are many features
                            in the bill he did not like, but rather than go home without a bill for
                            the purpose indicated he would vote "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN said he voted against this bill because he believed we had no
                            right to repeal the law creating a State Agency in New York until all
                            these bonds are fully paid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD said he had desired to give reasons at length for opposing this
                            measure - he had numerous facts and figures to present against its
                            passage - but he could not recite them now in the limited time In which
                            he supposed the Senate would require him to present the reasons for his
                            vote. He deprecated the course pursued by the friends of the bill in
                            thrusting it upon the Senate under the operations of the previous,
                            question; and trusted it would be defeated in the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER, in explanation of his vote, said: I came here determined to
                            vote for some adjustment of our State debt. I believe the debt will be
                            due on the 19th of January, 1866; I feel that the honor of Indiana
                            requires an adjustment. I voted in favor of the Branham bill on the
                            motion to strike it out from the enacting clause. I regret that that
                            bill could not have'been amended and passed. The Bradley bill, now
                            on its passage, was this morning, on my suggestion, amended so as to
                            create a fund that will in eight years discharge the debt. The bill
                            under consideration having been amended in this particular is no longer
                            liable to the objection made by me last evening. The bill, now on its
                            passage, is not entirely satisfactory to me. But it is the only bill
                            before the Senate providing for the payment of the State debt. A vote
                            against that bill will place me in .the position of repudiating any and
                            all arrangement for the paying of the debt. I do not want to occupy that
                            position, and I shall vote, under all the circumstances, for the bill,
                            as not the best but as the only plan for the payment of the debt. I love
                            Indiana too well to stand opposed to the payment of her debts. If I
                            believed that the debt was not due I should vote against any bill
                            whatever. But entertaing the other <pb n="207" xml:id="VAA8558-08-207"/>
                            view, and earnestly desiring so see this incumbus removed, I vote
                            "aye."</p>
                        <p>The result was then announced as above recorded, and so the bill passed
                            the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FINCH introduced a bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_313">S. No.
                                313</ref>] for An Act to amend sections 1 and 4 of An Act to
                            reorganize the Evansville Insurance Company, which was passed to the
                            second reading.</p>

                        <p>The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the special order for this
                            hour, viz: Mr. Dunning's bill, S. No. 40, establishing an
                            Agricultural College at Bloomington. A division of the question on Mr.
                            Culver's amendment having been demanded, the first question will be
                            on striking out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING withdrew his demand for a division of the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BEESON moved to amend the amendment by striking out all after the
                            word "Act" and insert this: "locate the Agricultural
                            College in the county of Wayne by the citizens depositing $100,000 in
                            the Citizens Bank of Richmond, subject to the order of the Board of
                            Trustees of said college for the use of said college."</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. gave reasons for the location as proposed in the amendment, which
                            he considered paramount. The great principles involved in this question
                            have been ably discussed, and the simple point remaining is, where shall
                            the College be located? The citizens of Wayne county would feel proud to
                            have it located there; and having no college buildings sufficient, they
                            have proposed to give $100,000 in money. He referred to the enterprise
                            and energy of her people; the richness of her soil; the extent of her
                            manufactories; and declared that "old Wayne" stood pre-eminent
                            in many things, and second to no county in the State in every thing
                            which pertains to the happiness and enioyment of man.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER made an ineffectual motion - yeas 22, nays 25 - to lay the
                            amendment to the amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to recommit the bill to the Special Committee, with
                            instructions to report a substitute leaving the Trustees of the Indiana
                            Agricultural College free to locate the same where a donation may be
                            given not less than $100,000, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. CULLEN the motion to refer was laid on the table by yeas
                            34, nays 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT moved that the Senate resolve itself into a Committee of the
                            Whole for the consideration of this subject. His object was to obtain
                            the sense of the Senate by a kind of ballot in the Committee - no record
                            of which would appear on the Senate journals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Williams in the Chair) opposed this motion. He desired a
                            square vote on each locality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT regarded this whole college matter as a consummate humbug, and
                            believed that it would prove a leach upon the treasury.</p>

                                        located, and the bill now under considorat on shall be
                                        recommitted with instructions to amend the bill by inserting

                        <p>Mr. NILES opposed the resolution, regarding it as preposterous to limit
                            the vote of Senators, in finally fixing the location of this college, to
                            one of the three points named in the several propositions before the
                            Senate.</p>
                        <p>He spoke decidedly in favor of Indianapolis as the most central and
                            accessible point, and argued to the Senate that to locate such an
                            institution at a point inconvenient of access, would defeat the chief
                            object of the grant and tend to make the institution like our other
                            colleges, a mere schooe for boys, and it would be as unwise as to have
                            located the French Polytechnic Institute elsewhere than at Paris.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB declared in favor of locating the college at Bloomington. Let
                            this endowment go hand in hand with the Institution already placed
                            thereby a donation from Congress many years ago. He regarded that as the
                            only situation that would give satisfaction to the people of the State
                            at large.</p>

                            recommending an appropriation of $20,000 to pay the indebtedness
                            thereof, including $2,000 for contingencies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER moved to strike out $2,000 for contingents recommended in
                            the report.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER held that it was not competent for the House to amend the

                        <p>Mr. HOWARD moved to refer the report to the <orgName>Committee on Ways
                                and Means</orgName>, with instructions to incorporate the amount
                            recommended in the Specific bill. He moved to strike out
                            "$20,000" and insert $18,000 in lieu, as the recommendation to
                            the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK said the treasury wras now empty, and we would have to borrow
                            money to pay the interest on the State debt. He thought we ought not to
                            make these large appropriations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD. Should these institutions be carried on by the officers, at
                            their own expense? This sum was to pay the actual indebtedness of that
                            prison. These convicts must be fed and clad; and, if their labor did not
                            pay for these, the State must do it. He was told by the warden that
                            probably $12,000 would be enough for this prison for the ensuing
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES. If there was any way to get round this appropriation, with
                            credit to the State, he would do it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. At the last session the Legislature appropriated 12,000; and
                            now they ask for $6,000 more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD said the $12,000 went to pay old debts - and there was still a
                            deficit of $18,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES. The institution was now absolutely in debt to that amount. It
                            was enormous, but it was inevitable. It must be met. The committee had
                            no way of looking into this matter, but through the reports of the
                            officers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK. The time was when the convict labor more than paid expenses
                            by $7,000 to $10,000 - Mr. Patterson clothing and feeding the
                            convicts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER, Mr. COLLINS, Mr. HAMRICK, Mr. FOULKE, Mr. HENRICKS, Mr,
                            BRANHAM, and others, explained the reason of the present contracts for
                            convict labor, and why the present deficit was so large.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD said, in reply to Mr. Hamrick, that we were not considering
                            the question whether the present was the most economical way of managing
                            the prison. He might agree with the gentleman that it would be best to
                            lease the prisonthe convict laborto an individual. But that was not the
                            question. It was a question of paying debts incurred by the State's
                            agents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK could not see why the convicts could not dig the sewers. He
                            would have a division of the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. The convicts were all hired out according to law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS stated the case. It was a question whether we can control
                            these officers. We might just as well give these men the control of the
                            Treasury at once. He counselled that it was best to turn out these
                            officers and <pb n="209" xml:id="VAA8558-08-209"/> put in men that knew
                            something about the business. It was paying for unauthorized
                            expenses.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD. If they did expend more than was authorized, they did not
                            expend more than was necessary to run the prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB explained that the Directors had been changed this year. The
                            estimate of debt submitted at the last session were $6,000 too low.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL thought discretion should be given to the <orgName>Committee
                                on Ways and Means</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER said the amount actually due was $16,625; indebtedness for
                            repairs, $550; for estimated repairs, $750. He demanded the previous
                            question, and under its force, the House refused to refer the report to
                            the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName> - yeas 31, nays
                            52.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved that the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>
                            be instructed to report an appropriation of $18,000 to pay the

                        <p>Mr. LITSON moved to reconsider the vote just taken.</p>
                        <p>The motion was agreed to; and the question recurred on the motion of Mr.

                            to report an appropriation of $18,000 for the Southern Prison.</p>

                        <p>[A message was received from the Acting Governor vetoing the enrolled act

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK called up Mr. Branham's amendment of the Rules, of which
                            notice was given yesterday, terminating the morning business at 10

                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE, (by unanimous consent,) rom the Select Committee thereon,

                        <p>Mr. GLEASON asked that the bill S. No. 306, in relation to the vacation

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM called up the special order. viz: the consideration of his
                            bill [H. R. No. 313] to abolish the offices of President and
                            Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, transferring their Justness to the
                            Auditor and Treasurer of State, etc., it being on the third and last
                            reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. REESE moved to amend so as to close up the business of the Board of
                            Commissioners of the Sinking Fund in the year 1866.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM opposed the motion by prudential considerations.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM, from the <orgName>Committee on Ways and Means</orgName>,
                            obtained leave to amend their report by including the amendment,
                            submitted by him yesterday, directing the County Treasurers to pay over
                            to the State Treasurer all the moneys in their hands, excepting those
                            loaned out, and the Congressional Township School Fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr, SPENCER said the effect of this amendment would be that there would
                            be no more of the school fund left in the counties. The entire fund
                            would be merged into State bonds. He resisted the amendment and the
                            bill, because it would take accommodations away from the people of the
                            State which are valuable to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY. Large amounts of the school fund laid idle with his County
                            Treasurer, because they did not want it; because the process of
                            obtaining these loans was too expensive. It cost one man $13 to get a
                            loan of $100.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Since the amount that may be loaned is not limited to $300,
                            he thought the money would not be idle hereafter. And since there could
                            be no complaint on the score of loss, he was opposed to taking this fund
                            away from the counties. By means of these loans the farmers of the State
                            had been able to clear up their farms. It had been a good thing for
                            resort in case of emergency, The bill was "to take in these funds
                            from the counties, and purchase State bonds with them, at whatever they
                            can be had. There was about $560,000 of this fund on hand, and about
                            $800,000 loaned out. If he was correctly informed, these Fund
                            Commissioners owed it to the Legislature and themselves, to show whether
                            they have not loaned large, sums of this fund to themselves.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM stated that there were of this fund $800,000 in the hands of
                            the Commissioners, and $1,400,000 in the counties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL showed the saving of $100,000 in buying Indiana State bonds
                            with these $600,000 at the present value of the bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH continued to reason against this bill, because it was
                            drawing from the agricultural portion of the State a large amount of
                            money. And instead of investing in our own bonds, it would be better to
                            invest in the General Government bonds, exempt from taxation, and
                            bearing 6 per cent, interest, whilst our State bonds bear but five per
                            cent. He understood that our five per cents, were about par; and we
                            could buy up the Federal bonds at 95 to 97 cents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL was informed that our five per cents, could be bought for 88
                            or 89 cents.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM stated the object of the bill. The amount now on hand, not
                            loaned, shall at once be invested in State bonds; and, as fast as the
                            funds comes in it shall be invested in the same way. He defended this
                            policy. The currency was inflated. A contraction would make difficulty
                            in paying debts. Every dollar we pay now would be just so much made on
                            the excess we would have to pay when we shall come down to a gold basis.
                            How could we justify taxation to enable us to loan out this money to a
                            few? It was contrary to sound policy. The State had determined to
                            maintain common schools. But the whole of the school fund it not
                            sufficient, and the deficit <pb n="210" xml:id="VAA8558-08-210"/> had to
                            be made up by taxation. Then, whatever we make by buying State bonds
                            with this fund, would by so much reduce the taxes. He would answer Mr.
                            Coffroth with these considerations. If we let the State debt go over
                            without paying till the money pressure conies, we in effect increase it
                            by 33 per cent.</p>
                        <p>This bill involves the principle of the Bradley bill in the other branch.
                            We should pay our debt at this time, so that when the financial storm
                            comesas come it willwe shall be out of debt. Then the best interests of
                            the State require us to take this money and place it where every man in
                            the State will be benefitted by it. He alleged that farmers could not
                            pay 7 per cent. for this fund, in connection with the expensive
                            formalities about it. These $600,000 could be so invested at once in
                            State bonds that there would be $100,000 saved to the common schools. He
                            was opposed to the whole system of sinking funds, and would bring the
                            public creditors and the taxpayers as near together as possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL. The argument of the gentleman from Jefferson was
                            unanswerable. He referred to Mr. Coffroth's statement, that this
                            fund loaned to farmers at 7 per cent, was a special benefit, and alleged
                            that it was inconsistent with that gentleman's statement the other
                            day, that investments in agricultural pursuits did not pay more than
                            three per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH explained that his remarks the other day had respect to
                            large sums of money.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL submitted that the borrowers of this fund in nine cases out
                            often were in no condition to pay when their notes become due. They
                            could pay now, when money is plenty, better than at any future time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK having voted against the issuance of bonds of the State at
                            the rate of six per cent., was compelled to vote against this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FOULKE demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN desired to amend by making the interest 5 per cent, on the
                            new bonds. The previous question was seconded, and the main question was
                            ordered, viz: Shall the Committee's amendments be adopted?</p>
                        <p>The amendments of the Committee were rejected - yeas 47, nays 47; and the
                            question recurred on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend by inserting in section 4, line 3, this:
                            "or in the stocks and bonds of the United States, at their market
                            value, not exceeding par value, and bearing a rate of interest at 6 per
                            cent per annum."</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed further to amend in the 5th section, line 3, strike
                            out "of" and insert this "paid for the Indiana State
                            stocks." This would provide against an objection urged by Mr.
                            Coffroth, that there shall be issued new bonds only for the amount paid.
                            The shave enures to the benefit of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM and Mr. HENRICKS. As the bill now stands the benefit of the
                            shave would enure to the school fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. And it would probably double the debt of the State in the
                            case of the purchase of the 2 1/2 per cents.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, it was ordered that this special order be
                            continued until disposed of.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER announced the special committee on Mr. Buskirk's College
                            bill, H. R. No. 6, viz: Messrs. Buskirk, Branham, Foulke, Lasselle and
                            Gleason.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. KILGORE, the House took a recess till 2 o'clock P.

                        <p>The House resumed the consideration of Mr. Branhain's bill, No. 313,

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB supported it in a few considerations. He thought it poor
                            policy to borrow money to increase the school fund.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was adopted - affirmative 44, negative 29.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed further to amend the fifth section to make it
                            conform to the former amendment, striking out the words "the
                            principal of" and substituting this: "the amount paid
                            for." It was adopted.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM now called for another vote on his bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_095">H. R. 95</ref>] to enable Railroads to
                            alter their lines in certain cases, which failed yesterday for want of a
                            constitutional majority.</p>
                        <p>It was passed the House of Representatives yeas 74, nays 16.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. DUNHAM, the Morgan Raid bill [S. No. 15] was taken up
                            and made the special order for Monday two o'clock P. M.</p>
                        <p>On his further motion, the Senate amendments to Mr, McVey's
                            county-seat bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_125">H. R. No. 125</ref>]
                            (heretofore described in these Reports) were taken up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM explained the amendments.</p>
                        <p>They were concurred in.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COFFROTH the bill [S. No. 34] was taken from the table
                            and placed in the files.</p>

                        <head rend="center">FORFEITED RECOGNIZANCES.</head>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Henricks in the Chair) his forfeited
                            recognizances bill [H. R. No. 294] was taken up. It is to secure
                            forfeited recognizances to the common school fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. P. submitted sundry literal corrections, which were taken by consent;
                            and then - the <pb n="211" xml:id="VAA8558-08-211"/> question being on
                            the third reading - </p>
                        <p>The bill was read through by the clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT rehearsed the provisions and objects of the bill. The first
                            object is to require the security to live within the jurisdiction where
                            the offense is committed. The second object is to require a judgment
                            against the surety on the first default of appearance; or what is in
                            effect a judgment, if he fail to bring in the principal within six
                            months. Then thirdly, if public justice be sold out by the second
                            recognizance, the amount named in the original bond shall go into the
                            common school fund as well as the second forfeiture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HARRISON. It is provided that the Court shall have no distinction as
                            to remitting any part of these forfeitures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. Yes. The Court can pronounce no judgment except for the
                            amount named in the bond.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER stated the law as it now stands, submitting objections to the
                            bill - taking judgment, against sureties not in their own county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DURHAM said our law now makes the judgment of forfeiture a lien on
                            the property of the security. There were two judgments; and from the
                            date of the judgment of forfeiture, it is a lien on the property. But
                            this bill makes no lien on the property.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT called attention to the 8th section. Nothing is repealed which
                            is not inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM insisted that it did repeal. It was monstrous to take judgment
                            against a man's property without giving him any notice. True, he
                            has six months to return the principal. But if he return, and a new
                            recognizance is made, and forfeited, the original as well as the second
                            forfeiture are both collectable. He would not go the bail of his
                            grandfather under such a law as thathe might get sick.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. The present law in reference to bail had just about as well
                            be repealed. He never knew a man convicted that was out on bail, nor a
                            forfeiture collected. He would have this bill even more stringent than
                            it is. If we intend to tighten the reins and punish crime, it was
                            absolutely necessary that this law should be changed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES demanded the previous question and there was a second.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (closing under the rule) read the eight section of the bill,
                            and replied to Mr. Dunham's objection. It would not destroy the
                            lien on the property of the principal. The gentleman called it a
                            monstrocity because the security shall appear at the time. It was but
                            reviving the law before 1852. He had been informed by an officer of the
                            Court in this city, that not a cent had been derived from any forfeited
                            recognizance here for the past live years.</p>
                        <p>Under the pressure of the previous question, the bill was then passed to
                            the final reading - yeas 74, nays 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT moved to reconsider this vote, and to lay that motion on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>The latter motion was agreed to.</p>

                        <p>On motion of Mr. NEWCOMB, the orders were suspended, for the
                            consideration of engrossed House bills.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Olleman's Railroad Forfeiture bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_123">H.R. 123</ref>] coming up, it was read
                            through by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. If it would interfere with the construction of the Fort
                            Wayne and Southern Railroad, we ought to think before we act on it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER and Mr. COLLINS concurred with Mr. Kilgore.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN said its passage would render the act of last session,
                            authorizing the purchase of branch roads inoperative and void.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said the bill would not interfere with any road that has a
                            charter. It was intended to affect that branch of the New Albany and
                            Chicago Railroad proposed from Gosport to Indianapolis. He demanded the
                            previous question, and there was a second.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN (under the rule) said the New Albany Company obtained the
                            right of way for not more than one-fifth of the way of this branch from
                            Gosport. Since the last session another Company had organized for a
                            railroad from Vincennes to Indianapolis, and they could not come up the
                            White river valley from Gosport, without the New Albany Company's
                            right of way. Hence the necessity of the bill to encourage a railroad
                            outlet for the counties of Owen, Green, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then passed the final reading in the House - yeas 51, nays
                            21.</p>

                    <p>Mr. A. said this bill was to prevent a monopoly - to stop the fleecing of the
                        people as is now done in almost every city - by authorizing competition in
                        the gas manufacturing business.</p>

                    <p>Mr. NILES explained. This bill provides that in case it is proposed to open a
                        highway which will cross a railway, if there is a rail-road agent in the
                        county to be found, ten days notice shall be served on him.</p>

                        <p>The select committee's bill, S. No. 307, regulating fare to be
                            charged by Railroad Companies in this State for the transportation of
                            passengers on their roads; coming up - </p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER hoped Senators would stop and ask themselves what right the
                            Legislature has to fix the prices of labor for men or corporations. This
                            bill proposes to do something not in the power of this or any other
                            Legislature to do; and, desiring to be satisfied that he was right on
                            this point, he moved to recommit the bill to the <orgName>Judiciary
                                Committee</orgName>, with instructions to inquire into the
                            constitutionality of its measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT thought it high time we should know whether the people or the
                            railroads rule the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN desired this bill to pass. Let us say what we believe to be
                            right, and leave the constitutional question to the courts, He was
                            opposed to monopolies, and the railroads in his section, as far as
                            charging for freight and passage between intermediate points is
                            concerned, have become monopolies, and are charging exhorbitant
                            rates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON would not record his vote in favor of this bill, for he knew we
                            have no authority to regulate the tariff on railroads. He admitted that
                            to a great extent railroads have become monopolies, but the men who cry
                            out against them are the very men who make no jffort to get at them in
                            the right way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MOORE understood the whole object of the bill to be that railroads
                            shall not charge nore in proportion for way than they do for through
                            passengers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON insisted that you have no more authority to control a
                            corporation than you lave to control an individual. If you have the
                            right to interfere with the private matters of individuals or
                            corporations in one case, you lave the right in another. Police
                            regulations should be provided and enacted by the Legislature for the
                            running of these roads, for the present laws on this subject are almost
                            inoperate, and of but little benefit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, said it must be admitted the people complain not
                            unjustly of the exactions practiced by many railroads. He read from a
                            letter which had been handed to him, praying legislation requiring
                            railroads to nove freights in turn, and at a rate per mile or local
                            freights not exceeding through rates. <pb n="213" xml:id="VAA8558-08-213"/> He understood this bill to contemplate
                            only this regulation in reference to passenger tariffs. It proposes
                            roads should charge no more per mile for local than for through travel.
                            The three cents per mile in the bill could, and doubtless should, be
                            amended to such sum as would yield a fair return; but when railroads
                            attempted to charge more than a fair return on their capital, he
                            believed the Legislature might step in to protect the people, and that
                            the Courts would sustain that legislation. He was not an enemy of
                            railroads; he regarded them as great civilizers, and wished they
                            permeated every county in the State. But as a representative of the
                            people, he felt it due to them that some consideration should be given
                            to their interests in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA regarded this as truly a judicial question, and could not see
                            that these interminable attacks on railroads would do any I good. He
                            believed there was but one railroad in the State that was to-day paying
                            a dividend on its stock. If railroads have been trifling with their
                            chartered privileges, let the Legislature lay the strong hand of the law
                            upon them, but not till then. It might be well for the
                                <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> to examine this bill and
                            determine that question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD hoped the bill would pass, if, as he understood it, it will have
                            the effect of stopping these extortions that are being practiced upon
                            the people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB did not think there was a Railroad Company in Indiana that could
                            afford to carry passengers at the rate fixed in this bill. It is all
                            wrong to legislate against railroad companies in this way. He reasoned
                            to show that prejudices were raised against railroad companies without
                            just cause, and insisted that the argument was clear and conclusive
                            against the provisions of this bill, outside of; the legal question, and
                            with regard to that, there was no doubt in his mind but that the bill is
                            unconstitutional, unjust and illegal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN did not wish to be understood as unfriendly to Railroads
                            because he favored this bill. He had a duty to perform to his
                            constituents, and the question with him was simply: Have we a legal
                            right to pass the provisions of this bill; and, if so, is it politic? He
                            gave conclusions that led him to affirm this proposition.</p>

                        <p>Mr. COBB introduced a bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_314">S. No.
                                314,</ref>] to authorize the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners to
                            invest any moneys belonging to said fund in Indiana State bonds or
                            stocks, or in the United States stocks, and when invested in Indiana
                            State bonds or stocks, to provide for their cancellation, and to provide
                            for the issuing of new non-negotiable bonds for the benefit of the
                            school fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. C. moved to dispense with the constitutional provision, that the bill
                            may be read the second time now. This was an important measure, and its
                            friends were anxious that it should get to the House at the earliest
                            possible moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD opposed such hasty legislation in matters of so much importance,
                            and trusted this bill would be allowed to take its regular course, that
                            every member may have an opportunity of examining and understanding
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB did not desire to have the bill passed without examination. It
                            was drawn up with care and designed to take the place of the bill [H. R.
                            47] passed the other day and vetoed by the acting Governor. He thought
                            it embodied the views of a large majority of Senators, for the objection
                            to and defects in the old bill have been carefully avoided in this. If
                            the motion to suspend the rules should prevail he would then move for a
                            further suspension that the bill may be read the third time. It should
                            pass the Senate at once or it may not reach the House in time to become
                            a law before the final adjournment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, pronounced the bill satisfactory to the bitterest
                            opponents of the bill passed a few days ago.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON was satisfied that the provisions of this bill were correct. He
                            would be much gratified if the Senate would suspend the rules and pass
                            the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN thought this bill a fair one, and that it ought to pass. He
                            was decidedly in favor of having the rules suspended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD. The Constitution provides that a bill shall be read on three
                            separate days, that opportunity may be given to reflect upon its
                            passage. This bill is presented for the first time this afternoon, and
                            it is very difficult to understand it by the reading of the clerk. He
                            understood that the bill providing for an adjustment of the public debt,
                            passed yesterday, disposes of this fund, and now it is proposed to pass
                            a conflicting provision. He would like an opportunity to examine this
                            bill. He should always regret the hasty manner in which the Senate has
                            been putting through measures of great interest to the public. If
                            measures are to be passed in haste, and without study or reflection, he
                            could not speak for the justness of the provisions of any law that may
                            be passed. He should vote against suspending the rules to hurry through
                            measures of importance.</p>
                        <p>The motion to suspend the constitutional restriction was agreed to by
                            yeas 35, nays 3.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB, conformably to previous notice, moved to further suspend the
                            rules that the bill may be read the third time now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD moved to amend the motion so that the bill may be referred to
                            the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>. He thought he might
                            probably be for it; but there may be something wrong in it the Committee
                            could find out that we can not discover by hearing it read.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB was satisfied the bill is all right. He had it in his room for
                            some time, and after a careful examination, did not hesitate to
                            pronounce it perfect in itself. He thought (upon a conversation across
                            the chamber with several Senators) that the Committee could examine and
                            report on it in a few minutes. With this understanding he had no
                            objection to the reference.</p>
                        <p>The motion to commit was agreed to.Mr. HANNA, from the <orgName>Committee
                                on Corporations</orgName>, returned Mr. Finch's bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_313">S. No. 313</ref>, to amend the charter
                            of the Evansville Insurance Company; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read the second time.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the rules were suspended - yeas 39, nays 0 - and
                            the bill was read the third time.</p>
                        <p>It was passed the Senate by yeas 39, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER from a special committee thereon, returned the bill. <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_123">H. R. 123</ref>, to declare forfeited
                            the right of way of certain Railroad Companies to branch roads, no part
                            of which has been completed, &amp;c.; recommending its passage. The bill
                            was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr, Wright's bill, S. No. 308, to provide for the relief of persons,
                            or their heirs or assigns, who have made entry of public lands belonging
                            to the State where the State is not competent to make a good title; was
                            read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT cited cases in his county which the bill was intended to
                            remedy.</p>
                        <p>It was passed the Senate bv yeas 38, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thompson's bill, S. No. 159, for the erection and maintenance of
                            Houses of Refuge or Schools of Reform by counties and cities, and the
                            employment therein of certain persons; was read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said this city was building such an institution and this
                            bill was to help that along, though general in its character. It also
                            permits all counties that choose to send to the Indianapolis House of
                            Refuge.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed by yeas 38, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName> returned
                            Mr. Cobb's common school fund bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_314">S. No. 314</ref>, introduced a few
                            minutes since; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD moved to amend by striking from the bill so much as authorizes
                            the investment of the funds in seven-thirty United States bonds. He gave
                            reasons why his amendment should be adopted. United States bonds were
                            now below par they were continually fluctuating in value; and the school
                            fund would probably be the loser by such an investment. He thought his
                            clause would prove to be a damage to the sinking fund, because under its
                            operation the fund would ultimately be the loser instead of the
                            gainer.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. CULVER the amendment was laid on the table by yeas 25,
                            nays 13.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD moved to amend by striking out from the fifth section the words
                            "six per cent." and inserting this: "at the rate of
                            interest the several bonds so taken up may have borne."</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. CULVER this amendment was also laid on the table by yeas

                        <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. CARSON, his bill, No. 312, to amend the title of an act

                            Joseph county, for loss on account of a robbery of the safe of his
                            office. The Committee consider that it would be inexpedient to allow
                            said claim, because it would be setting a dangerous precedent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS and Mr. BOYD said this was as meritorious as any claim of
                            that class could be.</p>

                            County Commissioners to authorize turnpike road companies, etc.,
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr.BONNER, from the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned the
                            road bill [S. No. 217], a majority of said Committee recommending its
                            passage, with this amendment: strike out "one mile," and
                            insert "three-quarters of a mile" in lien.</p>
                        <p>He also returned Mr. Cox's bill H. R. No. 258, amending the 14th
                            section of the Couuty Business act of February 18, 1859, so as to raise
                            the compensation of Township Trustees from $1,50 to $2.50 per day,
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, from the Select Committee thereon, returned his
                            Soldiers' Home bill No. 321, with amendments, striking out
                            "1500" and inserting "200," in the 4th section; and
                            striking out and inserting: "Report such proposition to the
                            Governor, who, if he approve the same shall notify the Auditor of State,
                            who shall draw his warrant for the price to be paid for said land, not

                            returned Mr. Gregory, of Warren's bill, H. R. No. 260, to provide
                            compensation to the owners of animals killed or injured by the rolling

                                Railroads</orgName>, returned Mr. Sim's bill, H. R. No. 257,
                            requiring railroad companies to furnish transportation to persons
                            desirous of shipping live stock, and to charge uniform rates therefor,
                            recommending its indefinite postponement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE submitted a report from a minority of said committee,
                            respectfully differing from the foregoing report, and recommending the

                        <p>Mr. THACHER, from a majority of the Select Committee thereon, returned

                            district &amp;c., with the expression of opinion that legislation is
                            unnecessary thereon, and recommending that the bill be laid on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FERRIS, from a minority of the same committee, reported the opinion
                            that the bill ought to pass with an amendment in section 2. After the
                            word "Rush," insert "Ripley," and regulating terms.

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, from the select committee to which was referred the Message
                            of the Acting Governor, with reference to the procurement of some more
                            secure place for the public offices and the archives of the State,
                            submitted a report recommending the purchase of the building offered for
                            sale by the Bank of the State at the crossing of Washington and Illinois
                            streets, which could be readily sold again by the State upon the
                            completion of a new State House. The committee recommend a loan of money
                            from the Sinking Fund at 6 per cent, interest, for the purchase of this
                            building, at a cost not exceeding $86,000, and the sale of the old
                            Treasury lot at not less than $20,000; and they reported a bill [H. R.
                            No. 327] for this object.</p>
                        <p>The bill having been read by the Clerk - </p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH moved that it be recommitted with instructions to amend, so
                            that instead of borrowing this money, let it be paid out of any money in
                            the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
                        <p>Mr, NEWCOMB. We have not got the money in the Treasury. The other day I
                            was informed there was not more than $10,000 in the Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Oh! then, I take it back.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed to the second reading.</p>

                            Senate amendments thereto. The committee propose sundry further
                            amendments. In the first and fifth sections, strike out "1856"
                            and insert "1859." Strike out and insert: The commissioners of
                            the county through which said road passes shall apportion the valuationj

                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM moved that these amendments be now taken up and considered. He
                            explained the amendments which had been carefully prepared by the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Understanding that one object of the bill was to release
                            railroad companies from assessments prior to 1859, instead of 1856, he
                            said there should be another amendment there, releasing county officers
                            from liability in such cases. He had not the amendment with him.</p>

                            the House took up the consideration of the bill [S. No. 198] repealing
                            the thirty cents soldiers tax for next year, entitled an act for the
                            repeal of the act of 1865, for the relief of the families of soldiers,
                            seamen and marines, etc., with amendments, by way of substitute,
                            (heretofore reported from the Select Committee on the Soldiers'
                            Home, and described in these Reports.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK stated that Mr. Ferris had introduced a bill on this subject,
                            which was carefully considered by the <orgName>Committee on Ways and
                                Means</orgName>, which agreed upon an amendment setting aside from
                            the soldier's relief tax collected for the sum of $5101,860,000 to
                            pay liabilities of the State incurred on account of the Sanitary
                            Commission. But these amendments of the special committee make provision
                            for the consumption of the entire thirty cents tax, without making any
                            provision for the re-payment of the money borrowed by the Governor for
                            the Sanitary Commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY thought Mr. Buskirk erred, because the Special Committee set
                            apart 15 per cent, of the tax; a part of the amount is to go to the
                            Governor's ban, and the remainder to a Soldiers Home. $150,000 to
                            the Sanitary Commission and $150,000 to the Soldiers' Home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM would willingly vote money to make soldiers comfortable, but
                            nothing towards a Soldiers' Home. He was opposed to bleeding the
                            people in this indirect way. He saw the workings of the Soldiers'
                            Home at Washington - the best in the country - they could not keep the
                            soldiers comfortable there, and they would get away if they were not
                            retained by disability and the guards.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS concurred. We should not erect institutions to swallow up money
                            to support officers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. This amendment proposed to do what gentlemen desire - it
                            provided for making the soldiers comfortable in their respective
                            counties at home. It provided in the 2d section that the County
                            Commissioners may do this. It was provided that 15 per cent, of this tax
                            (estimated at $150,000) shall be for the support of persons who have
                            been disabled in the military service - the partially disabled and
                            wholly disabled; and for the comfortable support and education of their
                            wives, mothers and childrentheir widows and orphans. The residue to
                            become a part of the general fund to be disposed of as the County
                            Commissioners pleasefor the relief of such needy persons, their wives,
                            mothers and children, their widows and orphans.</p>
                        <p>With regard to a necessity for a Soldier's Home, he said the
                            committee had visited the Home at this city, and found there more than
                            thirty persons who were entirely unable to take care of themselves. He
                            had a bill pending for a Soldiers' Home [H. R. No. 321] which he
                            described.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, stated his objections to this amendment. He was
                            opposed to any diversion of this money which had been assessed and
                            collected for the relief of war families in the respective counties
                            where collected. It should remain in the counties as a fund for county
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURNES opposed the amendment because there was in it no provision for
                            those counties which have expended all that they have collected of this
                            tax.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER also opposed the amendment. Nineteen-twentieths of the
                            petitions on this subject indicated their desire that this money - the
                            thirty cents levy for 1865 - should be retained in the counties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. TRUSLER was also opposed to the amendments. As a soldier himself, if
                            he went to a poor house, he would prefer to go to a poor house at home.
                            And no honorable man would go to such a place - State or county - if he
                            were able to take care of himself. He wanted no military poor house. Now
                            we had put down the rebellion, let us dispense with all useless military
                            institutions and military parade. He would divert enough of this tax to
                            pay the $50,000 which the Governor has borrowed for the Sanitary
                            Commission, and the balance should be retained in the counties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM'S objection was that the Committee was attempting to do
                            by indirection what cannot be done directly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. If the bill pass without any of our amendments the $100,000
                            will remain with the Counties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM would not keep up this circumlocution. The State could not
                            build up a Soldier's home to do any good, as cheaply as the same
                            work can be done by the counties at home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY was opposed to these amendments because it created more
                            offices. If this thing goes on, the whole Republican party will be in
                            office before long.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE desired to know whether this bill would prevent the County
                            Commissioners from extending relief where none have yet been received?
                            [Voices, "No, no."]</p>
                        <p>Mr. SPENCER made an ineffectual demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. (Mr. Higgins in the Chair.) He answered Mr. Kilgore, that if
                            we accept the Senator's bill without amendment, all this
                            benevolence would be stripped from the counties. He recited the
                            provisions of the committee amendments. He considered that it was no
                            difference how, so this public benevolence reaches the disabled
                            soldiers, their families and successors. This benevolence should be
                            distinguished from that vulgar charity which is found in the poor
                            houses, where those go who are beyond the pale of social life. Could it
                            be that each county could supply an infirmery for the support of the few
                            there, and that all this could be done cheaper than the State could
                            institute and supply a common infirmary for the care of all the disabled
                            and their unfortunate dependents - their children who have become the
                            children of the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM moved to recommit the bill with instructions to provide
                            additional pensions for the disabled soldiers of all classes, equal to
                            those paid under the pension laws of the United States. He meant to
                            include the classes of beneficiries mentioned in the bill; and that the
                            tax shall be levied just as that authorized at the last session for the
                            relief of soldiers' families.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS objected to the payment out of the County Treasuries. He would
                            have the <pb n="218" xml:id="VAA8558-08-218"/>soldiers supplied at home,
                            and the pay out of the State Treasury.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE thought it best to let the bill pass. How were we diverting this
                            thirty cents tax. We give back 85 per cent to the counties. For the
                            benefit of the disabled, he thought we ought to pass this bill. He was
                            satisfied that a majority of the soldiers would not leave their homes
                            for relief. We could pass the bill, and learn how to take care of these
                            beneficiaries hereafter. He moved to add instructions to change the 15
                            per cent. to 10 per cent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL proposed further to amend the instructions, so as to require
                            a bill making it obligatory on the County Commissioners to make such
                            approppiations out of the County Treasuries as will be sufficient for
                            the relief of the disabled in the counties where they reside.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE replied to Mr. Trusler's objections to a Soldiers'
                            Home. The gentleman forgot that there were quite a number of soldiers
                            entirely disabled.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS. Where is their $8 a month?</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. That would not supply clothing. He considered the economy of
                            the question. What was $150,000 or $250,000 to the people of the State
                            of Indiana, compared with this object of relief for our disabled
                            soldiers? They might be taken care of in some of the counties, but it
                            could not be denied that in many counties they would be neglected. He
                            was for the bill which would lay the foundation for a great State
                            institution for the care of our disabled soldiers, and their
                            families.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and
                            the main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SULLIVAN, of Vanderburgh and Posey, moved to lay the amendments on
                            the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RICE. If this bill takes 15 per cent, of the tax of 55, his county
                            would have to borrow money and pay back to the State. He would provide
                            so that the County Boards shall support the disabled.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL withdrew his amendment to the instructions to the
                            Committee.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays on Mr. Sullivan's motion to lay the amendments on
                            the table, resulted yeas 48, nays 31.</p>
                        <p>So the proposed amendments were laid on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB would never vote for the repeal of the soldiers' relief
                            law, unless something were done for disabled soldiers. He moved that the
                            further consideration of the bill be postponed, and that it be made the
                            special order for 2 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>It was so ordered: and then the House took a recess until 2 o'clock,
                            P. M.</p>

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB called up the special order, viz: the consideration of the

                        <p>Amend the third section by adding: And it shall be the duty of the
                            several Boards of County Commissioners of the several counties in the
                            State to provide in a liberal manner, from said funds, or from the

                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Churchi in the chair) proposed to insert after the word
                            "provide," this: in such manner as they shall deem best;"
                            so as to distinguish this from that poor-house charity, which we

                        <p>This was accepted; and so the amendment was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed further to amend, by adding a section to this
                            effect: The Treasurers of the several counties of the State shall pay
                            over to the Treasurer of State 7 per cent, of'the tax of the year
                            1865 - out of which shall be appropriated the amount by the Governor for
                            the Sanitary Commission; and the residue of said per cent, shall be
                            applied under the direction of the Governor for the relief of the
                            soldiers who have been honorably discharged; and the Governor shall make
                            report thereof to the next General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE proposed to amend further by adding: Nothing in this act
                            shall be construed to prevent soldiers from receiving any relief to
                            which they are entitled which they have not been allowed under the act
                            of March 3, 1865.</p>
                        <p>The amendment to the amendment, and the amendment as amended, were
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT proposed further to amend, by adding at the end of the 2d
                            section: "And provided that no part of the fund so retained in the
                            county treasuries shall be applied in payment of the bonds or orders

                            1865, for the issuance of bonds and levying and assessing taxes for
                            their payment during the years 1865, 1866,1867 and 1868, except for the
                            payment of one-fourth thereof in each of these years, as provided in
                            said act; and it shall be unlawful for County Commissioners to pay any
                            money or issue any bonds or orders in this direction except as provided
                            in said act." It was to provide, he said, that the speculators who
                            have bought up these <pb n="219" xml:id="VAA8558-08-219"/> bonds at a

                            objections to this amendment were urged by Mr. BUSKIRK, Mr. MILLER and

                        <p>The General City Corporation bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_103">S.
                                No. 103</ref>] coming up - </p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. HAMRICK (the Constitutional restriction being suspended
                            for the purpose), the bill was read the second time by title.</p>
                        <p>The several amendments heretofore reported from the <orgName>Committee on
                                Corporations</orgName>, having reference to surveys and street
                            improvements, street and other railways, shade trees, sanitary and moral
                            regulations, publication of city ordinances, legalization of all levies
                            of taxes heretofore made, etc., were read by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK proposed to amend the 34th section to this effect: "And
                            if designed for public grounds. Parks, Fairs or Cemeteries, such real
                            estate may be purchased by such city, although lying without the
                            corporation limits; and such city may provide for the protection
                            thereof, and the manner in which the same shall be occupied; and all
                            such purchases heretofore made by such cities are hereby legalized and
                            confirmed."</p>
                        <p>It was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS proposed further to amend in the 57th line of the 41st
                            section, by striking out "fifteen," and inserting
                            "five" in lieu, as the number of acres that may be attached to
                            such cities by way of addition. This proposition, he said, was to make
                            it as the law now stands. But by this bill you may force the adjoining
                            farmer to give up fifteen acres of his cornfield, and subject him to
                            city taxation. Five acres was enough to take at one time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK. It does not subject him to taxation for more thon five
                            acres.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. Yes it does. He had conversed with the gentleman who drew the
                            bill, and he says it is the very object of the bill to extend their
                            limits.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS interposed a proposition to amend, by striking out
                            "four" and inserting "two," with reference to the
                            term for which Mayor and Councilmen shall be elected. He said this bill
                            contemplates four years for these terms. If the city have a poor officer
                            two years was long enough.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed this, to come in at the end of the 66th section:
                            "Provided that all contracts made by any city or any officer under
                            the authority thereof for public improvements or otherwise, in the
                            profits whereof such officer shall be interested either directly or
                            indirectly, shall be null and void."</p>
                        <p>It was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK said these amendments of the general City Corporations law
                            were the result of conference and advice with a large number of Mayors
                            and City Officers in the State; and they were generally sanitary in
                            their character - intended to provide against the coming pestilence.
                            They had been carefully examined by the <orgName>Committee on
                                Corporations</orgName>, and were unanimously recommended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, by unanimous consent, interposed the following, of which he
                            desired the reporters to take notice:</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN (in his seat). I think as long as the gentleman from Monroe and
                            the gentleman from Vermillion are here, we shall be amply supplied with
                            gas. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>The resolution was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS now renewed his motion to strike out "fifteen" and
                            insert "five," in the fifty-seventh line of the forty-first
                            section of the bill. He thought any man happening to have a farm near a
                            city, and desiring to occupy it for farming purposes, should not be
                            subject to taxation, such as a rapacious City Council may choose to
                            impose upon him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK was opposed to the amendment. Such a man enjoys all the
                            benefits of the city, and he ought to pay for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK was still impressed that there was another section of the
                            bill, in which it was expressly provided that not more than five acres
                            of such addition shall be taxed.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. HIGGINS, it was ordered that it be made the special
                            order for 10 o'clock Monday.</p>

                        <p>Mr. RICHMOND made inneffectual motions for a call of the Senate -

                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked, in explanation of his vote, that he was in favor of
                            educating negro children, but by voting against the resolution he could
                            not express his true sentiments. He was opposed to exclusively taxing
                            whites for the education of the blacks, and as the only means of
                            avoiding such a conclusion, he was compelled to vote
                            "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON, when his name was called, said: For many long years it was
                            customary to tax the negroes of this State to educate the whites; and he
                            thought it but right that we should reciprocate. He was really opposed
                            to educating colored people by a tax upon the whites in toto, but was in
                            favor of taxing the whites and blacks both for educating colored
                            children. If we keep a debased and despised race among us it will only
                            tend to drag our children down; therefore, he was in favor of educating
                            that population. For these reasons he voted against the resolution.</p>

                            Representative Newcomb,) recommending the passage of a bill [S. No. 316]

                        <p>On motion by Mr. BEESON the House amendments to Mr. Bennett's bill
                                <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_198">S. No. 198</ref> for repeal of the
                            soldier's family relief law, were considered. The first amendment -
                            to section 3 - was concurred in. The second amendment adding a section
                            directing the paying in the State Treasury of seven per cent. of the
                            moneys collected under the act repealed, out of which shall be
                            appropriated seven per cent, for the indebtedness incurred by the
                            Governor for the relief of Indiana soldiers; and the remainder applied
                            to the relief of discharged disabled officers and soldiers: being read - </p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN opposed concurrence in the second amendment. We have just now
                            concurred in an amendment which requires the Board of Commissioners of
                            each county to attend to the necessities of sick and wounded soldiers.
                            He could see no necessity for taking out of each County Treasury 7 per
                            cent. of the moneys collected under the law of last session, and
                            bringing it here for the Governor to do with it precisely what we have
                            enjoined upon the Commissioners of each county to do. If the Governor
                            has expended money in anticipation of What the law of 1865 authorized to
                            be collected, let him so report to this Legislature; and if he has paid
                            out moneys, as he was authorized to do, every Senator will say, let its
                            know the exact amount, and where it has gone to, and it is all right. He
                            insisted that if the first amendment of the House of Representatives is
                            carried out, there will be no necessity for the second - the one now
                            under consideration. To bring 7 per cent. of these moneys up here to be
                            expended in taking care of disabled, sick and wounded soldiers, seemed
                            to him unnecessary. If a proper bill was brought in to take care of this
                            class of persons, no Senator would vote against it. Then let us leave
                            the money where it is, in the several counties. He would favor the
                            building of a Soldiers' Home, but was not willing to take money
                            from the several counties in this round-about way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB concurred in most of the remarks of the Senator from Rush, [Mr.
                            Cullen,] but when soldiers return from the field they do not stop in
                            this city, as a general thing, longer than is absolutely necessary, and
                            they want no Soldiers' Home in Indianapolis. In the locality where
                            he lived, he was proud to say, no soldier or relative of a soldier
                            depending upon him for support has ever suffered. He saw no necessity
                            for this amendment, and hoped it would be voted down. It is proposing to
                            make a tax upon the people for something that is not asked for by the
                            soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER, knew of counties not thirty miles from here where soldiers,
                            their widows, children and wives have suffered; and the trouble was that
                            those who sympathized on the other side did not give their dollars to
                            aid them. Then there were soldiers who had no homeno direct and absolute
                            abiding places and they could not be provided for so economically
                            anywhere else as they could at a soldiers' home right here in
                            Indianapolis. He thought the amendment was right and proper.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON also favored the amendment. He did not understand it would
                            compel County Commissioners to expend one dollar of this money. It
                            leaves it to their discretion. Gentlemen have to say now, whether they
                            will vote for this provision, or one similar to it, or whether they will
                            compel the soldiers to go to poor houses. The County Commissioners have
                            no authority by law to provide homes for homeless soldiers, and they are
                            compelled to send them to those dens of refuge called county poor
                            houses. He feared we would adjourn without making provision for any
                            relief to our disabled soldiers if this amendment should fail; and he
                            urged upon Senators to vote for the amendment rather than take such a
                            risk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN contended that the first House amendment already concurred in,
                            provides that County Commissioners shall take care of disabled soldiers
                            - it makes it their imperative duty; then what is the necessity for
                            bringing this seven per cent, to the city of Indianapolis? He said
                            nothing against the project of a soldiers' home; for he would
                            gladly co-operate in such an idea, if properh carried out. He would vote
                            for an amendment paying out of this fund any sum the Governor has
                            already expended in pursuance of the act of last session, but would go
                            no further. He would not vote to put money in the hands of the Governor
                            to do that which you have already required County Commissioners to do.
                            He desired that this tax levied under the law of. 1865 should be used
                            for the purpose of clearing the counties of their indebtedness: and for
                            no other purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB understood the bill to require every county which has already
                            expended the <pb n="223" xml:id="VAA8558-08-223"/>fund collected under
                            the law of last winter, to raise and send up here seven per cent, of
                            that fund. That being the case, this amendment should not be adopted. He
                            should oppose spending money to build up an institution which would give
                            salaries to persons who might spend their time in perambulating the
                            State denouncing better men than they. He believed County Commissioners
                            would take care of suffering soldiers, and was willing to trust this
                            matter to them. He gave many reasons for his opposition to the building
                            up of a State Soldiers' Home, for we have Soldiers' Homes in
                            every county, in every hamlet, town mid city, and in every heart.</p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON would infer from remarks made in this debate, that
                            Indianapolis wanted this Soldiers' Home, and he desired to say, in
                            justice to his constituents, that this was the first time he had heard
                            of it, either here or anywhere else. His city had never dreamed of
                            asking for it. He saw justice in the amendment now under consideration,
                            and insisted that it should be concurred in without hesitation on the
                            part of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA moved to postpone the further consideration of this question
                            until 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, when he would propose a
                            substitute giving to each disabled soldier one hundred dollars. He was
                            willing to vote every dollar in the Treasury for charity, but not one
                            single cent to build up an institution for any pet of any party.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES doubted the wisdom of postponing action on this bill at this
                            late hour in the session. It would be a great misfortune were this bill
                            to fail, and he hoped that the Senate would act upon the amendment at
                            once.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER also opposed postponement.</p>
                        <p>The motion to postpone was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON demanded the previous question. The Senate seconded the
                            demand; and the main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>The amendment of the House was not concurred in - yeas 20, nays 21 - as

                        <p>Mr. BONHAM, when his name was called, said: As far as my vote is
                            concerned, I think our County Commissioners have paid in in advance all
                            the mpneys that should be required of them, and with that view I shall
                            be compelled to vote "No."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY, in explanation of his yote, said: Our County Commissioners
                            say they have borrowed a considerable amount of money, and I don't
                            know but to the full amount of the income from the tax levied; and I do
                            not propose to put my county in a position to pay 7 per cent. more than
                            other counties. I therefore vote "No."</p>
                        <p>Mr. NOYES announced that he had paired off on this question with Mr.
                            Vawter.</p>
                        <p>The vote was then announced as above.</p>
                        <p>So the Senate refused to concur in the second amendment of the House of
                            Representatives.</p>
                        <p>The third amendment adding a section that Commissioners shall not be
                            prevented from making allowances to such soldiers' families as are
                            entitled to the same under the provisions of the act repealed, where the
                            same has not been allowed; was concurred in.</p>
                        <p>The fourth amendment, providing that no part of the fund shall be applied
                            in payment of bonds or orders issued to procure bounties, etc., being
                            read - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY opposed putting in this prohibition against the application of
                            this money to the payment of these bonds. He was willing to trust this
                            matter to the County Commissioners - they would be more apt to bestow
                            this money properly than the officers of State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES coincided with the remarks of the Senator from Ohio (Mr.
                            Downey.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON had two or three reasons why this amendment should be concurred
                            in. If you leave it discretionary with the County Commissioners, they
                            will be pressed to pay all this money out for the liquidation of bonds.
                            He opposed taking money raised for support of soldiers' families,
                            to pay bounties to. men who have only been in the service for a few
                            months. The force of money power is such that the Commissioners will be
                            forced to pay this fund to the bond-holders, and allow the
                            soldiers' families to suffer.</p>
                        <p>This amendment of the House was rejected by yeas 15, nays 27.</p>

                            shall not be repealed, nor the State Agency in New York abolished,
                            unless the holders of the 2 1/2 and 5 per cent, bonds of the State
                            execute and the with their agent in the city of New York, their assent

                        <p>The subject was referred to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and

                        <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN, his Locomotive. Engineers bill, H. R. No. 301,
                            was made a special order for to-morrow 10 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM called up the special order, viz: the Senate amendments to the
                            House <pb n="226" xml:id="VAA8558-08-226"/> amendments to the Senate
                            Morgan Raid bill [S. No. 15.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. The Senate have concurred in all the House amendments except
                            that creating three commmissioners. He moved that the House insist on
                            its amendment to the bill, and ask a <orgName>Committee of
                                Conference</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>The motion to adhere was agreed to.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said the application for conference comes from the
                            Senate.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the House took up (out of order) the bill [S.
                            No. 314] to authorize the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners to invest
                            any money in their hands in Indiana State bonds or stocks, and to issue
                            new non-negotiable bonds payable to said fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM moved that the constitutional restriction be suspended, and
                            the bill be twice read by title, and ordered to the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN insisted that this bill should not be hurried through at once,
                            with only one reading. It was a bill of too much importance to treat in
                            that way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM said the House was as competent to pass upon it to-day as it
                            could be at any future day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. The gentleman from Jefferson might understand it, but he did
                            not think there were ten in the House besides that gentleman who could
                            say they understood it perfectly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER concurred with Mr. Branham.</p>
                        <p>The House refused to suspend the restriction - yeas 58, nays 30 -
                            two-thirds not voting in the affirmative.</p>
                    
                    <div type="section">
                        <head rend="center">ORDER OF BUSINESS.</head>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved a resolution ordering that sundry bills from the Senate
                            (embracing all in the files on the first reading) be taken from the
                            table, and that they be read the first and second time by title, and be
                            referred to a Select Committee of four members.</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. argued for this course, and defended it by reference to precedents
                            in the Illinois Legislature, and in the Senate of this General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER holds that it is not competent to make this motion, except
                            under a suspension of the rules.</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. moved a suspension of the rules to enable him to offer the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN insisted that such a course would not be in compliance with the
                            Constitution. But one bill could be before the House at the same time.
                            He read the constitutional provision. As for the precedent found in the
                            proceedings of the Illinois Legislature, he could not respect the
                            authority. You could no more consider two bills at the same reading at
                            the same time, than you could consider two bills on different readings
                            at the same time. Gentlemen would see that this course would be putting
                            their bills beyond their control, subjecting them to the favoritisms and
                            preferences of the special committee of four. Suppose he was in favor of
                            some of these ninety or a hundred bills proposed to be considered in
                            gross, and opposed to others of them, how should he vote? He made the
                            point that this resolution would be in violation of the 18th section of
                            the 4th article of the State Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. These bills, for want of time, were absolutely beyond our
                            control now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Why could there not be enough of unselfish patriotism in the
                            House to make a combination for the public welfare, by laying aside all
                            minor measures, and taking up only those of pressing public
                            importance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB thought, under this plan, we ought to get through with all
                            the bills. He answered the constitutional objection urged by Mr. Brown.
                            It was as competent to suspend the restriction on several bills, as upon
                            one bill. He understood that this rule was practiced in the Senate,
                            though not perhaps with so large a batch of bills at once.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS was unwilling, by this order, to take up bills on the first
                            reading, to the neglect of bills on the second reading, which were grst
                            in order. He moved, ineffectually, to lay the motion to suspend the
                            rules on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK had no personal interest in this motion. Gentlemen on all
                            hands had asked him to make it. It was to accomodate those members who
                            had not managed to get their measures forward. He promised that if this
                            order was taken, every bill should be reported by 12 o'clock
                            to-morrow.The rules were then suspended, and Mr. Buskirk's
                            resolution, embracing the order above described, was submitted to the
                            House, and read by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said the question on the adoption of the resolution (it being
                            a suspension of a constitutional restriction), would be taken by yeas
                            and nays.</p>
                        <p>The vote resulted - yeas 65, nays 22 - so, (two-thirds voting in the
                            afiirmative) the restriction was suspended, and the resolution was
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said: In the execution of this order, it is but candor on the
                            part of the chair to confess some want of confidence in directing the
                            suspension of a constitutional provision in gross; and in what he does
                            he will be regarded as strictly carrying out the order of the House.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER then announced the first and second readings (by title) of
                            bills from the Senate numbered: <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_284">284</ref>, [joint resolution No. 15,] <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_187">187</ref>, 228, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_223">223</ref>, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_215">215</ref>, 214, 213, 208, 220, 225, 230,

                        <p>The SPEAKER (responding to a Senate message) appointed the following
                                <orgName>Committee of Conference</orgName> on the disagreeing votes
                            of the two Houses as to amendments to the bill S. No. 15, viz: Messrs.
                            Newcomb, Dunham and Prather.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER then announced the consideration of bills from the Senate on
                            the second reading, viz: 36, 163, 108, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_199">199</ref>, 149, 185, 75, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_227">227</ref>, 106, 231, and they were read by title for the second
                            reading, and referred to the special committee of four.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN here interposed a question of order. He submitted that no bill
                            can be read by title and referred under the resolution of the gentleman
                            from Monroe, except such as are mentioned there by number - such as have
                            not been read at all.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER considered the point well taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS moved for a suspension of the rules to enable him to offer
                            the following:</p>

                                    <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That Senate bills numbered 36

                                        that the constitutional provision requiring their reading on
                                        three several bills be dispensed with; and that, these
                                        several bills be now read the second and third times - the
                                        second time by title.</p>
                                </div>

                        </floatingText>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM said we were breaking down all the safeguard the Constitution
                            has placed against hasty legislation. And he showed the inducements to
                            combinations for advantages under such a rule.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL proposed to amend; and that said Senate bills be referred to
                            a Committee of one member, who shall examine and report back such as he
                            thinks ought to pass, and that the same be passed without calling the
                            yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM proposed to add: And that the remainder of the members be
                            allowed to go home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB replied to Mr. Dunham's objections; and to the
                            constitutional objections.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM entered his protest against this summary legislation. If we
                            passed fewer bills, and taking more pains with them, the public good
                            could be better subserved.</p>
                        <p>[Mr. HAMRICK interposed an order for a night session, which was agreed
                            to.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS said, objection came with a bad grace from Mr. Branham, when
                            it was remembered that the gentleman himself had this day asked for a
                            suspension of the restriction on a bill reported by himself</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH also protested against this proceeding, and counselled a
                            reconsideration:</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN proposed to place it within the knowledge of every member, that
                            he could not vote for this resolution without violation of his
                            constitutional oath. The closing of a session of the Legislature was not
                            the emergency contemplated in that clause of the Constitution which
                            authorizes a suspension of the restriction, that each bill shall be read
                            three times on three several days. The Constitution not only requires
                            that but one bill should be considered at one time, but that the
                            Legislature shall not consider but one subject at a time. It was a
                            violation of the spirit of the Constitution; and the spirit was higher
                            than the letter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, filed a motion to reconsider the vote of the
                            House adopting Mr. Buskirk's resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS withdrew that part of his resolution which refers to the
                            third reading of the bills named.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL moved to lay the motion to suspend the rules on the table,
                            demanding the yeas and nays, which were ordered.</p>
                        <p>The motion was laid on the table yeas 62, nays 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, now called Up his motion to reconsider.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB justified and defended the action on Mr. B.'s order.
                            There were precedents which justifies it under the Speakership of Mr.
                            Allen, in 1861, and subsequently under the Speakership of the gentleman
                            from Monroe. He did not want to recede from this action, which would
                            pending business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LANE and Mr. MILLER doubted whether the reconsideration of the vote
                            on the resolution could vitiate the action on the bills referred to to
                            the Special Committee of four.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FOULKE demanded the previous question, and under its pressure, Mr.
                            Gregory, of Montgomery's motion to reconsider was rejected - yeas
                            88, nays 49.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. SHOAFF, of Allen, the House took a recess till 7

                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE moved for a dispensation of the orders, to enable him to
                            move to take up his bill H. R. No. 309, authorizing County Commissioners
                            to appropriate money for aiding im the erection and construction of
                            manufacturing and machine shops, under restrictions. He stated the
                            guards and restrictions with which the bill was invested.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL. Some citizens of Cass county had informed him that this bill
                            was more for the benefit of parties outside of Cass county, than for
                            Cass county herself.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL objected to this bill, because it puts too much labor on
                            those opposed to the Commissioners making the appropriation, requiring a
                            majority to remonstrate, whilst one-fourth may make the petition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK and BROWN replied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS made the point, that it is not in order to debate the merits
                            of the bill on the motion to take it up.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER overruled the point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN supported the bill by the consideration that this machine shop
                            in Cass county would increase the taxable property of the State a
                            million of dollars, besides all the individual and local advantages
                            connecting themselves with it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB did not want his County Commissioners to be taxing the people
                            of Marion county to build railroad shops. He demanded the previous
                            question, and under its force, House refused to suspend the the
                            orders.</p>

                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK called up the special order, viz: the bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_103">S. No. 103</ref>, repealing and revising
                            the general city corporation laws, the question being on the amendment
                            proposed by Mr. Rhoads to strike out "15," and insert
                            "five" in lieu.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, Mr. Higgins' amendment, adopted Saturday,
                            with reference to the term of office of Councilmen was reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS now withdrew the latter clause of his amendmentso much as
                            applied to Councilmen - and submitted literal amendments, and an
                            arrangement by which Councilmen shall be elected, the first half for one
                            year, and the second for two years, and so on, each class for two years
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HOWARD desired unanimous consent to amend by striking out the
                            provision authorizing the Common Council to annex and assess <pb n="228" xml:id="VAA8558-08-228"/> five acres of ground not within the
                            corporation limits of the city.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it is not in order - the House having acted
                            specifically on that point.</p>
                        <p>The bill was then read through by the Clerk, as amended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK stated that this bill was the result of the labors of the
                            joint committee, of the two Houses. That committee had employed a clerk,
                            at an expense of about a hundred dollars, and were occupied about two
                            weeks (in session every night, and Lieutenant-Governor Baker meeting
                            with them,) in its preparation. So many amendments had been fubmitted to
                            differents sections of the general act, that it was thought best to
                            codify the law in relation to city corporations. Since last winter, it
                            has become manifest that we shall very probably, next Spring, be visited
                            by the cholera. And there has been a convention of the Mayors of the
                            various cities of the State to devise and agree upon sanitary means to
                            ward off the pestilence. The committee have had the benefit of their
                            deliberations; and most of the amendments of the original draft of the
                            bill have respect to sanitary regulations. The bill is so long that its
                            scope cannot be fully understood from the Clerk's reading; and he
                            supposed that the House would have to vote for it on the confidence
                            which we repose in the Joint Committee.</p>
                        <p>He demanded the previous question, and under its force, the bill passed
                            the House of Representatives - yeas 56, nays 22 - Nr. Gregory, of
                            Warren, Mr. Abbett and Mr. Milroy explaining their votes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM made an ineffectual motion to adjourn.</p>

                        <p>It was read the third time by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER moved to amend, by striking out "land," and
                            inserting "lot." Amending the title by inserting
                            "nineteen" after "eighteen." Striking out
                            "'Recorder," and inserting "Marshal," in
                            lieu.</p>
                        <p>The vote stood - yeas 63, nays 1 - no quorum voting,</p>
                        <p>And then (at 9:45 P. M.) the House adjourned.</p>

                    <p>The report was concurred in.</p>

                    <p>Mr. CULLEN inquired whether this bill, in section 7, does not cut out heirs

                    <p>Mr. OYLER. In a former section of the bill it is provided that heirs may be
                        made parties, and shall appear and contest if they desire. The other section
                        only authorizes other persons to appear and contest when the heirs fail to
                        contest. It does not cut out the heirs.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN, section 7 was amended by striking out the words
                        "other than the heirs of the estate."</p>
                    <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CASON, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr.
                        Cullen's 4th Judicial Circuit bill, S. No. 298; Mr. Peden's bill.
                        S. No. 157, to repeal the 13th article, [the Senate having acted on a
                        similar House bill,] and Mr. Hord's bill, S. No. 274, concerning
                        pleadings in the matters of liens against the estates of decedents;
                        recommending that they lie on the table.</p>
                    <p>Mr. DOWNEY, from the <orgName>Judicary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                        select committee's railroad fare bill, S. No. 307; and the bill, H. R.
                        294, concerning proceedings on forfeited recognizances; recommending that
                        they lie on the table.</p>
                    <p>These reports were concurred in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NILES, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the
                        Committee's bill, S. Nos. 266 and 267, in relation to the
                        reorganization of Courts of Justice; without recommendation, and on his
                        motion Mr. Oyler had leave to withdraw them from the files', that he
                        might perfect them for the next session.</p>
                    <p>He also returned the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_299">H. R. 299</ref>,
                        legalizing the acts of deputies of persons serving in the army; recommending
                        its passage.</p>
                    <p>It was passed to the third reading.</p>
                    <p>He also returned Mr. Bennctt's joint resolution, S. No. 23, with regard
                        to the time when the laws of the present session shall take effect;
                        recommending that it lie on the table.</p>
                    <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. DOWNEY, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned the

                        criminal court in the city of Indianapolis, with amendments to <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_277">277</ref>, striking out the words "such
                        jurisdiction as is provided by law," and inserting this:
                        "concurrent jurisdiction with justices of the peace and common pleas
                        courts where the line does not exceed three dollars." Also, amendments
                        to <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_278">No. 278</ref>, so that it shall not
                        interfere with the circuit court. <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_279">No.
                            279</ref> is reported without amendment. <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_280">No. 280</ref> is amended by inserting
                        appropriately the word "misdemeanor." The Committee recommend that
                        No. 300 be laid on the table.</p>

                    <p>These amendments were agreed to and the bills were passed to the third

                    <p>Mr. ALLISON, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned Mr.
                        Brown of Wells' joint resolution, S. No. 23, for an amendment to the
                        Constitution providing for Annual Sessions; recommending that it lie on the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WARD, from the <orgName>Committee 0n Corporations</orgName>, returned Mr.
                        Van Buskirk's bill, S. No. 80, and Mr. Gaff's bill, S. No. 85,
                        concerning city corporation laws; recommending that they lie on the table;
                        as all necessary legislation is embodied in the bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_103">S. No. 103.</ref></p>
                    <p>The report was concerned in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NILES, from the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName>, returned his
                        bill, S. No. 186, to define the rights of parties to joint contracts in
                        cases in which judgments have been rendered against a part of the makers of
                        such contracts but not against all; recommending the adoption of a
                        substitute embracing entirely new matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. RICHMOND, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                            Business</orgName>, returned the bill, H. R. 184, to amend An Act
                        regulatin the fees of officers; recommending that it be indefinitely
                        postponed, for reason that a similar bill has already passed.</p>
                    <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BEESON, from the <orgName>Special Committee on Agricultural
                            Colleges</orgName>, reported inability to present conclusions to the
                        Senate, and asked to be discharged from further consideration ot the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BONHAM, from a majority of the Select Committee thereon, returned Mr.
                        Mason's bill, S. No. 291, creating the 16th Judicial Circuit;
                        recommending its passage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. MASON from a minority of the same Committee, submitted a report
                        recommcndin that the bill lie on the table.</p>
                    <p>The bill was passed to the third reading.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER, from a majority of the Select Committee to which was referred Mr.
                        Ward's bill, S. No. 236, requiring railroad companies to furnish
                        transportation to persons desiring to ship live stock; returned the same
                        without recommendation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WARD, from a minority of said Committee, presented a report urging the
                        passage of the bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER moved to indefinitely postpone it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WARD hoped this bill would not be indefinitely postponed. He thought it
                        worthy of consideration. The grain dealers in the county he represented,
                        lose thousands of dollars every year because they can not get cars
                        sufficient for shipping purposes - the railroads will not furnish the cars
                        necessary for the transportation of live stock and grain. He hoped the
                        Senate would carefully consider the matter and give the bill a fair chance
                        at any rate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN hoped the enemies of this bill would allow the question to come
                        fairly before the Senate. There is no question in which our agricultural
                        people are more interested than this thing of shipping their freight.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER. To-morrow is the last day on which we can pass any bills, and why
                        can not Senators vote as squarely upon the question to postpone as upon any
                        other question on the merits of the bill? if is the same in character as the
                        bill proposing a limited charge for carrying passengers, and on that bill
                        the <orgName>Judiciary Committee</orgName> have reported that we can not
                        legally legislate. He realized the necessity for something to be done in
                        this matter; but the bill proposes not only an impropriety, but an
                        impossibility.</p>
                    <p>The motion to indefinitely postpone was agreed to, by yeas 22, nays 19.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. CARSON, the amendments of the House of Representatives to
                        Mr. Bennett's bill, <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_103">S. No. 103</ref>,
                        concerning laws for the incorporation of cities; were taken up.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. OYLER, the clause authorizing publication in the city
                        papers, was stricken out.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COBB moved to concur in the House amendments to section 41, with an
                        amendment striking out and inserting a clause that cities or towns through
                        which railroads pass may assess the railroad property on the same basis that
                        property of natural persons is assessed, and collect taxes thereon as other
                        taxes; but tin rolling machinery shall be taxed by the mile. This amendment
                        is to prevent conflict with a bill already passed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CORBIN objected to preventing corporate authorities from making
                        assessments for taxation upon other than railroad corporations; as he
                        understood the amendment to do.</p>
                    <p>The motion (Mr. Cobb's) was agreed to.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. NILES, the House amendment to section 84 was concurred in,
                        with an amendment providing that it shall take a vote of two-thirds of the
                        Common Council to vacate a part of any street.</p>

                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN, from the <orgName>Committee on Finance</orgName>, returned
                            the bill, H. R. 313, abolishing the offices of President and
                            Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, etc.; recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, moved to recommit the bill to the Special Committee
                            on the State Debt, with a view to inquire whether any legislation is
                            necessary upon this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN. This bill does not interfere with the question of the State
                            debt at all. He thought the evident intention of the motion was to
                            delay, if not to defeat the bill. It is desired that this bill should be
                            passed for fear the Bradley bill [S. 279] should fail; it having for its
                            object what the friends of that-bill claimed would save to the State
                            $20,000 a year. Unless this bill is reported on to-day or to-morrow it
                            will fail. He therefore opposed the motion to refer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER understood this bill re intended to strangle the Branham bill
                                [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>] and get one of
                            the principal guns of the Bradley bill spiked. For this reason this bill
                            ought to be defeated, and if not defeated it ought to be carefully
                            considered by the special committee on the State Debt, which is composed
                            of members from every Congressional District in the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN objected to the statement that this motion was intended to
                            kill the bill - he hoped such charges would not be indulged in by any
                            Senator on this floor. If there be no adjustment made of the State debt
                            he would favor this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAPMAN desired if this bill is defeated that it should be done
                            squarely and fairly. It was understood that the Bradley bill can not
                            pass the House, and if this bill is not <pb n="230" xml:id="VAA8558-08-230"/>passed, no proposition will be perfected,
                            looking to an adjustment of the State debt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN could see no unfairness in the proposition to refer the bill
                            to the special committee. He understood there was a feeling to force the
                            passage of the Branham bill, or no other measures of the kind shall
                            become a law, and he looked upon this as a second edition of the Branham
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY moved to amend the motion to refer by requiring the committee
                            to inquire into the expediency of amending the bill by striking out all
                            authorizing the investment in Government bonds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, accepted the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT insisted that all important bills and bills appropriating
                            money, should be in here long ago, that they might receive the proper
                            consideration at the hands of appropriate committees. In the present
                            condition of our financial affairs, he would not vote to pay bonds
                            before they were due, and he did not want to go home without adjusting
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON counselled moderation in the consideration of this important
                            question, and deprecated the arbitrary feeling manifested here. The
                            proposition to abolish the Sinking Fund offices was all right; and why
                            rot place this measure in a position that a majority may strike hands
                            upon it? He could see no good to come from referring this bill again to
                            any Committee, and hoped the resolution would be promptly voted
                            down.</p>
                        <p>The motion to recommit was agreed to by yeas 24, nays 18.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GIFFORD introduced a bill [S. No. 317] for An Act to legalize bonds

                            submitted conclusions that cast no censure on that officer, and closed

                            of taxation now oppressing the people. He moved to lay the resolution on

                        <p>Mr. ALLISON, when his name was called said: If this was an original
                            proposition to have the report printed, I should vote against it. But as
                            we have already incurred the expense of printing the roll of officers, I
                            am unwilling now to deny to the wife and little ones of the private
                            soldier, who has borne the heat and burthen of the war, the pleasure
                            that will be afforded them in finding the names of loved ones enscribed
                            on this roll of honor. I, therefore, vote in favor of the resolution. I
                            vote "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN, in explanation of his vote, said: If this was an original
                            proposition, I should vote against it. I regret exceedingly that such a
                            misunderstanding has taken place; but inasmuch as some gentlemen have
                            gone to great expense, aud as the price aas been reduced so
                            considerably; and inasmuch as the Adjutant General has almost prepared
                            his entire work, I shall be compelled, I confess with reluctance, to
                            vote "aye."</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA desired to say a few words in explanation of his vote. He was
                            conscientious in carrying out in letter and spirit, all the contracts
                            entered into by the Assembly with outside parties. He was afraid, from
                            all the information he could gather together, that greater expense had
                            been saddled upon us in the publication of the Adjutant General's
                            report than had been contemplated by the original mover of the measure.
                            He had a very high regard for the Adjutant Generalhe was one of the most
                            amiable and accomplished gentleman he had ever knownand he would not
                            lose this opportunity to say, that he had put forth a book of eminent
                            usefulness, and one that would be appreciated and esteemed by the
                            public. But he was afraid the publication of his report was
                            unnecessarily expensive and more than we had agreed to pay. lie. was,
                            therefore, under all the circumstances, compelled to vote against the
                            measure, and he would say he did so with regret.</p>
                        <p>The result was then announced as above recorded.</p>
                        <p>So the resolution was rejected.</p>

                        <p>Mr. COBB opposed the passage of the bill. The building proposed to be
                            purchased was unfit for occupancy by the State officers. The vaults may
                            be secure, but that is the only reason to his mind, why the bill should
                            pass.</p>

                            the first and second time under a suspension of the rules - yeas 38,
                            nays 0 - and referred to the <orgName>Committee on Canals and Internal

                        <p>On motion by Mr. OYLER the rules were suspended - yeas 39, nays 1 - and
                            Mr. Cobb's bill, S. No. 286, to prohibit Clerks of Courts from
                            practicing law (described on page 143 of the BREVIER REPORTS) was read
                            the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS moved to recommit the bill with instructions to include
                            Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly. It was as likely
                            gentlemen here would get bills passed to suit their law cases, as that
                            Recorders and Auditors are likely to do wrong by practicing law.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BONHAM opposed the motion. There would not be a single lawyer on this
                            floor, if these instructions are carried out, but what would have to
                            resign and go home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER thought this a good bill, and hoped it would not be
                            recommitted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN moved to amend the instructions by adding these words:

                        <p>It was passed the Senate by yeas 40, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING moved to reconsider the vote of this afternoon, rejecting the
                            concurrent resolution reported from the Select Committee on the Adjutant
                            General's Report. He said: I have accomplished all I felt like
                            accomplishing at the time I voted in the negative. If it was an original
                            question, I would vote against printing the report at the present time;
                            but upon reflection, I do not think it would be doing justice to to the
                            Senator from Boone [Mr. Cason] not to adopt this resolution. He
                            introduced the resolution at the last session, and he informed this body
                            he was imposed upon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER had made up his mind to make a similar motion. Upon reflection
                            he was satisfied he was not doing justice to the State, or to the
                            soldiers or to the publishers of this report in voting against the
                            resolution. He therefore would vote for the motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB conceded the great value of this report. Innocent persons, he
                            had no doubt, would be injured unless the wyork goes on. One volume had
                            been published and the rest is a matter of duty to the private soldier,
                            and he asked what Senator would refuse this tribute of respect?</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK probably spoke too rashly when this question was up the
                            other day. He had not then fully weighed the House resolution. He did
                            not intend to do injustice to any one.The motion to reconsider was
                            agreed to.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. VAWTER, the word "present" was inserted before
                            the words "General Assembly,"</p>
                        <p>Mr. NILES remarked that it was possible he expressed himself more freely
                            than proper the other day when this subject was before the Senate. As
                            the resolution now stands, he regarded the proposition as extremely fair
                            and just.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CORBIN spoke in opposition to the resolution because he thought the
                            expenses were incurred without any authority. The work is one that will
                            do credit to the officer getting it up, and that gentleman will not
                            blame him for voting against this resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HANNA also opposed the adoption of the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY moved to amend by striking from the resolution all that
                            relates to depositing 1,500 copies for sale in the hunds of the
                            Librarian. He should vote agidnst the resolution for the reason that he
                            believed an imposition had been practiced on the Senate by some person,
                            and a rejection of the resolution is the only course left the Senate to
                            defend itself against such practices.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT demanded the previous question. The demand was seconded by
                            the Senate; and the main question being ordered - </p>

                            that it is impolitic and unwise to change the judicial system of the
                            State. The people scarcely become acquainted with one system before
                            enactments are made for the purpose of changing it. This certainly must
                            be evil in its results. So long as the system under which we have been
                            operating gives general satisfaction, he saw no reason for changing
                            it.</p>

                        <p>Mr. PRATHER, from the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>,
                            returned Mr. Speaker Pettit's concurrent resolution on the subject
                            of Foreign Interference in Mexico, and the Rule of Neutrality and
                            Belligerent Rights, recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>The resolution was read through by the Clerk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER demanded the yeas and nays on its adoption.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN said this resolution had never been properly under
                            consideration by the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.
                            The resolution was right; but resolutions of equal importance had slept
                            on the hands of that Committee from an early day of the session. He
                            moved that the further consideration of the concurrent resolution be
                            postponed, and that it be made the special order for Thursday morning 9
                            o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER said that he had tried to get the committee together, but
                            found it difficult to do so. The gentleman from Jackson was present, he
                            believed, at one of the late committee meetings in the Library.
                            Yesterday, upon receiving this resolution, he waited on the members of
                            the committee, in their places in the Hall. The gentleman from Jackson
                            was not, at first, in his place. When he called on Mr. Dunham, that
                            gentleman said Better not be in a hurry. He called on the gentleman from
                            Huntington, and the gentleman from Marion. Then wrote the report, and
                            presented it to the gentleman from Jackson, but does not remember what
                            reply that gentleman gave.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend the resolution by striking out these words:
                            "and by means entirely adequate to effect." He thought we had
                            better wait and withhold our efforts to establish a republican form of
                            government elsewhere, till we shall be confirmed in our own.</p>
                        <p>On the motion of Mr. BROWN, the further consideration of the resolution
                            was postponed, and it was made the special order for Thursday, at 10
                            o'clock A. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, from the Select Committee thereon, returned his Agricultural
                            College bill, H. R. No. 6, with an amendment by way of substitute. It
                            locates said College at Bloomington, in connection with the Indiana
                            University, on conditions, etc. The Trustees of the College to consist
                            of the Trustees of the Indiana University, increased to thirteen,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. COFFROTH, by unanimous consent, the reading of the
                            substitute amendment was dispensed with.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE (by consent) submitted a report from the <orgName>Committee
                                on Elections</orgName>, returning the bill, S. No. 221, for the
                            punishment of officers of elections for receiving illegal votes;
                            recommending its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH asked for unanimous consent to make a report from a select
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER objected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART asked and obtained leave to submit a report from the
                                <orgName>Committee on Employes</orgName>, recommending that the
                            Principal Clerk be allowed an additional Enrolling Clerk for one day,
                            and that the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName> be allowed a clerk
                            for four days at $5 a day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. It would require at least four or five Enrolling Clerks. He
                            moved to <pb n="234" xml:id="VAA8558-08-234"/> amend the recommendation
                            thus: That the Principal Clerk be allowed to employ as many additional
                            Enrolling Clerks as may be necessary to complete the work.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was agreed to, and so the report was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved that there be a suspension of the rules, to enable him
                            to move to take up his Agricultural College bill No. 6, and make it a
                            special order for half-past two o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH desired to amend the consideration for a suspension of the
                            rules, by adding that the House also take up his bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_207">H. R. No. 207</ref>, to protect the
                            people of the State against foreign insurance companies. It requires
                            those companies to make statements twice a year, and each to make a
                            deposit of $100,000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM supported Mr. Coffroth's amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>Here the morning hours expires.</p>

                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Montgomery, demanded the special order, viz: the
                            consideration of Mr. Brown's Locomotive Engineers bill H. R. No.
                            301.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the previous question thereon, and undar its force the
                            bill failed yeas 44, nays 36 - for want of a constitutional
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB called for the regular order.</p>

                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE moved to amend the motion, so as to take up all the bills of

                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM interposed a report from the <orgName>Committee of

                            as to amendments to the Morgan Raid bill S. No. 15. It appoints two

                        <p>Mr. WOODS. Does not the Senate amendment restore lines 11 and 12 in the
                            11th section of the printed bill?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Does not the amendment to that section allow the benefits
                            of the school to pupils from without the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS desired to confine its benefits to the children of the

                        <p>The several amendments of the Senate were concurred in, except that to
                            the 11th section, which expunges the words " residence in

                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB moved to reconsider the vote non-concurring in the
                            Senate's amendment to the eleventh section.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS showed that the effect of this was to admit pupils from other
                            States for pay. It was parsimony that he would regret to see, for the
                            State of Indiana to refuse pupils from Ohio etc., so long as the people
                            of Indiana can send their children to Normal Schools of other
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, concurred in the remarks of Mr. Rhoads.</p>
                        <p>The vote was reconsidered; and the Senate amendment to the eleventh

                            deposit to secure policies. It is for the protection of the people of
                            the State against foreign Insurance Companies.</p>
                        <p>The bill passed the House - yeas 60, nays 12.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stringer's swinging gate bill, H. R. 286, [on application of

                            man to hang a swinging gate on any county or township roads, with
                            restrictions.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK opposed the bill by practical considerations of public
                            convenience.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. The Yankees have a gate now that you can open and shut
                            without getting out of your buggy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLAZEBROOK. Yes; but we don't want to introduce Yankeeisms into
                            the Legislature of the State of Indiana.</p>

                        <p>On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, (the rules being suspended for the purpose,) it
                            was ordered that the Omnibus Committee report back the bill from the

                            action of the House; whereupon</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="VAA8558-08-237"/>
                        <p>Mr. HENDRICKS, from the select Omnibus Committee, reported said bill
                                [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_314">S. No. 314</ref>,] to the House
                            without amendment.</p>
                        <p>The bill was read by the Clerk - the question being, Shall the bill
                            pass?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM, believing that the proceedings in connection with this bill
                            were violative of the Constitution, he could not vote for it, and would
                            not.</p>
                        <p>Mr.HENRICKS moved a call of the House, which proceeded, till the Clerk
                            reported 71 members present and answering.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM had resolved in his mind not to vote for any bill from that
                            Commissioners. He desired the reporters to take it down, that he would
                            regard his vote for any of those bills, under the circumstances, as
                            violation of the Constitution, and of his oath to support it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN desired the gentleman from Jefferson to inform the House
                            whether, these Commissioners are compelled to turn the bonds in their
                            hands over to the State at the same price they paid for them?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK could not vote for the bill in its present shape. The new
                            bonds may be issued, not for the amount paid for them, but for the price
                            of the bonds purchased.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM said he was assured by the chairman of the <orgName>Finance
                                Committee</orgName> of the Senate, that the bill is right. It comes
                            with the endorsement of members of the Senate of both political
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The bill directs that the officers of the sinking fund
                            shall invest the sinking fund in the 2 1/2 per cent, and 5 per cent,
                            bonds of the State, or in bonds of the United States. He was informed
                            that at least a portion of the officers of the sinking fund have been
                            making money out of themone of them even boasting that he had made
                            $10,000 in that way. They had thus proved themselves unworthy of public
                            confidence. Now, suppose these Commissioners to have already bought
                            these bonds of the State at a discount. Then pass this bill, and they
                            would make a nice thing of it. They can buy up such as they control at a
                            high figure with their trust funds! He would move to strike out that
                            portion of the bill by which they have permission to invest these trust
                            funds in State stocks, and leave them no discretion but to invest them
                            in bonds or stocks of the United States. He then proceeded, in reply to
                            Mr. Dunham, to defend the constitutionality of the proceedings of
                            yesterday, which created the <orgName>Omnibus Committee</orgName>, and
                            made the reference of Senate bills to that committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM said, there had been $600,000 of this fund placed the hands of
                            favorites instead of loaning them as the law required. Here was an
                            outrage; but it was nothing, to Ms mind, in comparison with a disregard
                            by the Legislature of constitutional requirements. It was laying down
                            all the rights of the people at the feet of a temporary majority. He
                            argued the constitutional question till the ten minutes expired. As he
                            understood this bill he approved it, but regarding the sanctity of the
                            Constitution above every other consideration, he could not vote for
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB knowing the conscientiousness of the gentleman from Floyd, he
                            replied to the objections of Mr. Coffroth. The desire of the Legislature
                            had been indicated at the last session, that these trust funds should be
                            invested in State stocks. By the law the Commissioners were required to
                            keep enough on hand to meet the back bonds as they become due. They had
                            for this purpose a large amount on hand at the beginning of the last
                            session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. How much of those bank bonds were now on hand?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Some $20,000. He was not himself entirely satisfied with tne
                            proceedings of the Commissioners. They deposited $160,000 in a banking
                            house in New York, which had failed; and that left a suspended debt,
                            which would probably yet be paid. This bill proposed that they shall not
                            hold these trust funds any longer: but shall invest them where they can
                            not be speculated upon - can not be sold - Can not be stolen. We had but
                            just one day more to legislate in. Should we pass this bill, or leave
                            this fund for another year in the hands of these Commissioners?</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. Thinking we have had enough debate on this question, and more
                            than enough of lecture on the Constitution, and morality and conscience,
                            he demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. He understood that the house in New Nork was ready at any
                            time to make settlement for the new York deposit of this fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER insisted on his demand, and there was a second, and the main
                            question was ordered, viz: Shall the bill be recommitted to the select
                            committee, with instructions to report a provision, that non-assignable
                            bonds be made for the actual amount surrendered or paid for them?</p>
                        <p>The House refused to recommit - yeas 31, nays 48.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH moved to recommit to the <orgName>Committee on Ways and
                                Means</orgName>, with instructions to strike out all that relates to
                            the purchase of State stocks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER demanded the previous question on the passage of the bill, and
                            there was a second.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays, and the House ordered the main
                            question - yeas 51, nays 27.</p>
                        <p>The biil then passed the House of Representatives - yeas 53, nays 26 - as

                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE, when his name was called, said: The fifth section of the
                            bill provides that the two and a half and five per cent, bonds of the
                            State shall be bought up by the Sinking Fund Commissionorg with this
                            fund, or they shall invest the funds in United States stocks. On the
                            first day of May in every year, the Governor, Auditor and Treasurer
                            shall issue a new bond covering the amount of the fund paid out, the new
                            bond payable to the Sinking Fund, signed by the Governor, Auditor and
                            Treasurer. This conflicts with the sixth article <pb n="238" xml:id="VAA8558-08-238"/> of the Constitution, which says that no
                            debt shall be contracted on the part of the State except for a specified
                            purpose. This is for no specified purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB (in seat.) Can't we give one obligation for another?</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. No, sir, it is on these new bonds we are to pay six per
                            cent, instead of five per cent.</p>
                        <p>So the bill passed the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH moved to amend the title, by striking out the words:
                            "for the benefit of the school fund."</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM proposed to amend the amendment by inserting this: "for
                            the benefit of the money-shavers."</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH accepted the modification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS moved to lay the amendment on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH demanded the yeas and nays.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was laid on the table - yeas 56, nays 20.</p>
                        <p>And then under the pressure of the previous question demanded by Mr.
                            MILLER, the title was adopted without amendment.</p>

                                    were absent, and there was no quorum on this floor, by adopting
                                    the following resolution, offered by the Senator from Howard, to
                                    wit:</p>

                    <p>Mr. THOMPSON presensed a petition from citizens of Indianapolis praying the
                        Senate to reconsider the vote rejecting the bill, H. R, -- authorizing
                        builders to lay liens on property and sell without relation or appraisement;
                        which was laid on the table.</p>
                    <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi> laid before the Senate a
                        communication from the Doorkeeper, stating that his search for the sofas
                        formerly in the ladies' lobby has been fruitless. After stating that
                        Mr. Brown informed him that they were in their proper places when Mr. B.
                        visited his office, the communication read: From Mr. Stevenson I learn that
                        he has no positive knowledge of the property, but .that he infers from the
                        indecent and unruly character of the soldiery during the war in and about
                        these premises, that it is more than probable that they were removed and
                        made way with by them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. VAWTER moved that this communication shall not be spread upon the
                        journal.</p>
                    <p>After remarks by Messrs. Champan, Corbin, Cullen and Williams, the
                        communication was laid on the table.</p>
                    <p>The motion [Mr. Vawter's] was agreed to by yeas 33, nays 5.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN offered the following:</p>

                                <p><hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That Rev. David Stevenson be
                                    requested to publish the inuendo against the soldiers of
                                    Indiana, contained in his statement to Dr. Thompson concerning
                                    the sofas belonging to the Senate Chamber, upon the fly-leaf of
                                    his book entitled The Roll of Honor, as a recommendation of said

                    <p>On motion by Mr. CORBIN, the resolution was laid on the table by yeas 21,
                        nays 20.</p>
                    <p>Leave of absence was obtained for the <orgName>Finance Committee</orgName> to
                        consider the appropriation bills.</p>
                    <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi>, announced the special order for
                        this hour to be the resolution on the hanging of Jeff. Davis.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN, of Wells, it was postponed and made the special order
                        for 2 o'clock P. M. to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>Mr. HYATT, from the <orgName>Committee on Corporations</orgName>, reported
                        favorably on the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_263">H. R. 263</ref>, to
                        prevent conductors from obstructing highways or streets with cars.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NILES did not believe the public interest would be promoted by requiring
                        the breaking up of railroad trains as proposed in this bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. TERRY was sorry to hear objections to this bill coming from the Senator
                        from Laporte. In the rear or the town of Peru, in one of the <pb n="239" xml:id="VAA8558-08-239"/> counties he represents, is a marsh or morass
                        across which is but one public highway, and at that crossing the trains of
                        the Wabash Valley Railroad and the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad have been
                        in the habit for years of standing - frequently occupying the road for one
                        or two hours at'a time, and sometimes longer than two hours. Farmers
                        wishing to go to market, or men going that way with their families are
                        compelled to stand in the cold for sometimes two hours; and he thought it
                        but a matter of justice and right that this bill should pass. He had not
                        occupied much of the time of the Senate and had asked few or no favors this
                        session, but he now very much desired the passage of the bill.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NILES would regret to see the railroad interest so embarrassed as is
                        proposed by this bill. A bill could be proposed to meet the case of the
                        Senator with out having the effect to injure other railroads, and for such a
                        measure he would cheerfully vote.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER claimed to be a friend of railroads, but could not consider how
                        anybody could object to this bill. If an individual obstructs a highway, he
                        is liable under the law; and why should a railroad do the same thing longer
                        than ten minutes at a time, anyhow?</p>
                    <p>Mr. WRIGHT understood in the case cited by the Senator from Miami, the
                        stopping was made at that point by conductors, because of its convenience to
                        groceries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN could speak of cases similar to those referred to by the Senator
                        from Miami. He hoped the bill would pass.</p>
                    <p>The bill was read and passed by yeas 36, nays 3.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BONHAM, from the <orgName>Committee on Banks</orgName>, reported
                        favorably on the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_189">H. R. 189</ref>,
                        amending section 52 of the general banking laws.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Mr. ALLISON the bill was read and passed the Senate by yeas 37,
                        nays 2.</p>
                    <p>Mr. WILLIAMS offered a resolution, which was adopted, allowing the Principal
                        Secretary $3 a day for extra services.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. HORD, the railroad bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_123">H.
                            R. 123</ref>, was made the special order for 2 o'clock this
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the House amendments to the Senate amendments to
                        the bill <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_270">H. R. 270.</ref> for pay of
                        members and officers of the General Assembly were concurred in.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER, from the <orgName>Committee on Organization of Courts</orgName>,
                        reported favorably on the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_253">H. R.
                            253</ref>, amending section eight of the Common Pleas Set.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER stated that this bill simply changed the time for holding courts in
                        his Common Pleas District.</p>
                    <p>It was read and passed by yeas 35, nays 0.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. BROWN of Wells, the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_254">H. R. 254</ref>, amending the city charter of Huntington was read.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN, of Wells, explained its provisions.</p>
                    <p>It was passed the Senate by yeas 42, nays 0.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN, from the <orgName>Committee on Canals and Internal
                            Improvements</orgName>, reported favorable on the bill, H. R. 250, for
                        the incorporation of hydraulic companies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN explained the bill.</p>
                    <p>It was read and passed by yeas 39, nays 4.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. CORBIN, his bill, No. 288, requiring Clerks, of Circuit and
                        Common Pleas Courts to make general indexes of records in their offices; was
                        read.</p>
                    <p>It was passed the Senate by yeas 35, nays 6.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. BENNETT, the House message on his repeal of the
                        Soldiers' Family Relief bill, No. 128, insisting on the 7 per cent.
                        amendment thereto, was taken up.</p>
                    <p>Mr. B. would be opposed to this amendment, as an original proposition, and
                        would yet get out of it if there was any way to do it. He opposed sending
                        about $100,000 up here in this loose kind of way, to be disposed of in the
                        manner proposed, but rather than lose the bill he would vote for the Senate
                        to recede.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN held to his convictions expressed the other day, and hoped the
                        Senate would not recede from its former action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER understood the House would insist on this amendment with a great
                        deal of earnestness, and unless we recede there is a probability of the bill
                        being lost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN simply asked for a <orgName>Committee of Conference</orgName>, and
                        if they could not agree he would vote to recede rather than that the bill
                        should fail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. HANNA and Mr. GIFFORD were willing that there shall be such a per cent,
                        levied on that tax as shall enable the Governor to meet his obligations.</p>
                    <p>The Senate refused to recede from its action by yeas 15. nays 28.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. CULLEN a <orgName>Committee of Conference</orgName> was
                        authorized; which the Chair made to consist of Messrs. Cullen, Corbin and
                        Oyler on the part of the Senate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN, from the <orgName>Committee on County and Township
                            Business,</orgName> reported favorably on the bill, H. R. 240, to
                        relieve the county officers for 1865 from penalties of the dog law.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER hoped the bill,would fail to receive a sufficient number of votes
                        to pass it, as it is similar to a Senate bill to which he had heretofore
                        expressed opposition and which was rejected.</p>
                    <p>The bill was read and, rejected by yeas 20, nays 20.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN, from the same Committee, reported favorably on the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_276">H. R. 276</ref>, authorizing fee bills for
                        costs incurred in suits before County Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>The bill was read and passed by yeas 32, nays 3.</p>
                    <p>He also returned the bill H. R. 234 to repeal An Act in relation to the
                        reports of certain officers, approved June 3,1861; recommending its
                        indefinite postponement.</p>
                    <p>The report was concurred in.</p>
                    <p>On motion by Mr. BRADLEY the Senate refused to recede from its amendments to

                        supplemental to An Act for the Incorporation of Insurance Companies,

                        Gifford's bill, S.No. 317, <pb n="240" xml:id="VAA8558-08-240"/>
                        legalizing bonds issued by Boards of County Commissioners to pay for drafted
                        men; with amendments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BENNETT opposed the passage of this bill. The tax raised by the bill we
                        passed last winter is heavy enough.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NILES also stood opposed to this bill, as he did to the action of last
                        session on this subject. He could see no propriety in taxing returned
                        soldiers to pay bounties to drafted men who procured substitutes. It is
                        making an extraordinary exception in favor of a few.</p>
                    <p>Mr. GIFFORD. I desire to say. that I introduced this bill for the purpose of
                        getting legalized $17,000 00 worth of bonds issued by the Board of
                        Commissioners of my county, to drafted men who entered or procured
                        substitutes to enter the military service of the United States, to aid the
                        Government in suppressing the late rebellion. Our County Board acted in good
                        faith, and strictly in accordance with the will of the people on this
                        subject. We are only asking this General Assembly to do for us as much as it
                        has done for other counties, in legalizing the action of Boards of
                        Commissioners, in issuing bonds to persons enlisting into the military
                        service, not only to aid the Government in putting down the rebellion, but
                        to prevent a draft.</p>
                    <p>This bill only legalizes a class of bonds which we supposed was legalized by
                        an act of this General Assembly, approved March 3, 1865, on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. CULLEN hoped the bill would not pass. It seems unjust to pass a law
                        legalizing bonds issued to keep drafted men out of the service, when the
                        pockets of soldiers who have served faithfully during the war, have to be
                        taxed to pay them off.</p>
                    <p>Mr. OYLER opposed class legislation. This question has been settled by the
                        Judiciary, and he opposed the passage of laws to change the decisions of our
                        Supreme Courts.</p>
                    <p> Mr. COBB regarded it as just to the County Commissioners, they having made
                        the appropriation because it was insisted upon by the people; though
                        admitting it was done in violation of law.</p>
                    <p>Without taking action on the bill - </p>

                        <p>Mr. DUNNING said the bill had been read three times, but he had

                            of the bill, and he thought the institution was going to be an expensive
                            one to the State, he could not vote for it. He voted "no."</p>
                        <p>The roll call being finished - </p>
                        <p>Mr. THOMPSON said he opposed the location of this college at Bloomington
                            because he believed his constituents were opposed to it; and because he
                            thought it was not a central location. The question of location,
                            however, came before the Senate and was fairly won by the accomplished
                            President of the Senate; and he voted "aye" on this bill out
                            of pure compliment to that gentlemen, for whom he entertained the
                            highest regard.The vote was then amended. So the bill passed.</p>
                        <p>The bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_123">H. R. 123</ref>, declaring
                            forfeited the right of way of certain railroad companies to branch
                            roads, no part of which have been completed, and upon which no work has
                            been done for ten years, etc,; was read.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER explained its provisions and favored its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB had no idea if the cases to which this bill applied were known
                            to the House it would have passed that body. That body would not have
                            knowingly done the injustice contemplated by this bill to an already
                            overburdened and almost broken down corporation. The bill proposes to
                            take the property of one company, amounting to about $100,000, and put
                            it into the hands of another; and at this very time the company owning
                            the property is negotiating for its sale. He based his opposition to the
                            bill upon the simple question of justice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN sympathized with the condition of the road referred to by the
                            Senator from Lawrence, [Mr. Cobb,] but he regarded this as a case of
                            railroad companies vs. the State of Indiana, and as between the two, he
                            always unhesitatingly took sides with the people. His people were
                            overridden by a monopoly, which this bill would remove, and he earnestly
                            advocated its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT demanded the previous question; and under its operation - </p>
                        <p>The bill was passed by yeas 28, nays 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRADLEY, from the <orgName>Committee of Conference</orgName> on the
                            disagreements betweeii the two Houses on the State Debt bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>; reported ra substitute
                            therefor, embracing a blending of the provisions of the bills <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref> and S. 279.</p>
                        <p>Mr. B. said the main provisions of the bill are: It provides for the
                            abolishment of the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners on the 26th of
                            July, 1867, and that their duties shall devolve upon the Auditor and
                            Treasurer of State. The funds in the hands of the State Treasurer
                            belonging to the State Debt Sinking <pb n="241" xml:id="VAA8558-08-241"/>Fund, as well as the funds in the hands of the Board of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners, shall be applied to the extinguishment of the 2 1/2 per
                            cent, bonds first. The 10 per cent, levied for a State Dobt Sinking
                            Fund, as it comes in, is to be applied upon the 5 per cent, bonds. But
                            the five cent tax levied and dedicated to pay oft the War loan bonds,
                            when that comes in the officers shall notify the holders of those bonds
                            that the money is ready, and if they do not accept it. it is to be
                            applied toward the liquidation of the registered debt. And the State
                            Agency in the city of New York is to be abolished as soon as the
                            registered debt is paid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD raised a point of order as to whether amendments can be offered
                            here to a bill that is in the other branch of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS questioned whether a committee of conference have the right
                            to strike out from the enacting clause and insert other matter.</p>
                        <p>After remarks on these points of order by Messrs. Bennett, Niles, Carson,
                            Vawter - </p>
                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi>, with doubts as to its
                            correctness, decided in favor of the report, to accommodate Senators and
                            because of the great interests at stake.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD appealed from the decision of the chair.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BENNETT the appeal was laid on the table by yeas 38,
                            nays 67.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT demanded the previous question.</p>
                        <p>The demand was seconded by yeas 34, nays 12.</p>
                        <p>The report of the Conference Committee was then concurred in by yeas 38,
                            nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Pending the vote - </p>
                        <p>Mr. HORD, when his name was called, said he considered this measure of
                            vast importance, and he desired to discuss it, and give reasons why it
                            should not be adopted. He was gagged and chocked off by the previous
                            question, on the passage of the original bill; and thus measures of the
                            highest importance and interest to the people are pushed through here
                            without consideration and without time for reflection. As this amendment
                            had but an hour ago been reported to the Senate, and as we have not been
                            able to understand its provisions, he opposed the previous question
                            being sprung by the Senate upon measures of such moment. He merely
                            proposed now to express his unqualified condemnation of this process of
                            legislation upon questions of such great public interest, and, as in
                            this case, of as high importance as any that has been brought before the
                            General Assembly since the first adjustment of the public debt. He voted
                            " no."</p>
                        <p>The vote was then announced.</p>
                        <p>A message was received from the Governor announcing his approval of the
                            bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_119">H. R. 119</ref>, to create a

                        <p>It was read and informally passed over till the night session.</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. WILLIAMS, the bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_095">H.

                            cases, was read.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WILLIAMS said it only proposes to authorize alterations where there
                            are dangerous curves, etc.</p>
                        <p>The bill was passed the Senate by yeas 41, nays 0.</p>
                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT, from the <orgName>Committee on Roads</orgName>, returned the
                            bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_164">H. R. 164</ref>, to provide for
                            working highways contiguous to county lines, recommending that it lie on
                            the table.</p>
                        <p>The report was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STAGGS. This bill, as I understand, is a bill that is mainly
                            designed, when roads run on county lines, to bring each company under
                            obligations to do their part in keeping it up, and I hope the Senate
                            will pass it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLIGAN cited a case in his immediate neighborhood where this bill
                            would work a great hardship. He hoped the bill would be rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STAGGS. I will say to the Senator from Montgomery [Mr. Milligan] that
                            his is an entirely local matter, but the bill will apply to any road on
                            the line between any counties in the State.</p>
                        <p>The bill having been read - </p>
                        <p>Mr. STAGGS said: In connection with the remarks I have made, by the
                            hearing of the bill read Senators can discover that it is a fair one. It
                            is upon the fair principle that each county shall bear its portion of
                            the burden. That is about the sum and substance of it.</p>
                        <p>The bill finally passed by yeas 35, nays 6.</p>
                        <p>The Senate took a recess till 7 o'clock.</p>

                        <p>Mr. DOWNEY hoped the bill would not pass. The law as it now stands is

                        <p>Mr. NILES could see no danger in the provisions of this bill, though he

                        <p>Mr. WRIGHT explained the bill. It affected two counties which he
                            represents; and he showed the great advantages it would give to that
                            locality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN was satisfied the bill ought not to pass.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BENNETT regarded the bill as lowering the standard of teachers, and
                            hoped it would not pass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK hoped the bill would not pass.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN thought this an eminently proper bill. It leaves the matter in
                            the hands of the people interested, and that is right. On his motion the
                            words "and her" were inserted after the word
                            "him."</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON stated that the bill as it now stands would exclude females,
                            and if there was no other reason he would oppose the bill for that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OYLER also opposed the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. VAN BUSKIRK moved to recommit the bill with instructions to so amend
                            that the law of last session requiring the additional qualifications for

                            shall be inoperative till next September.</p>

                        <p>On his further motion he had leave to withdraw his amendment after the

                        <p>Mr. VAWTER moved to amend by appropriating $1,278 80 State money stolen
                            from Alfred William S. While, Treasurer of Brown county.</p>
                        <p>After remarks by Messrs Dunning, Cullen, Chapman, Bennett, Oyler and

                        <p>The amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING (Mr. Richmond in the Chair) moved to amend by allowing the
                            pages three dollars a day.</p>
                        <p>Objection being made - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNNING modified his amendment so as to read two dollars and a half a

                        <p>The amendment was adopted by consent.</p>

                        <p>On motion of Mr. CHAPMAN, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of
                            the general appropriation bill, read a third time just before the recess
                            for supper, with the understanding that amendments could be offered at

                        <p>Mr. CORBIN moved to amend by repealing sections 61 to 68 of the old bill
                            of last session, so as to wipe out this <orgName>Military Auditing
                                Committee</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT believed such a Committee was necessary then, (as a general
                            thing they are useless,) but as the emergency has passed, he should vote
                            for the amendment.</p>
                        <p>The amendment was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COBB moved to amend by striking out from the bill all that relates to
                            the appropriation for the Northern State Prison.</p>
                        <p>This amendment was resisted by Messrs. Chapman and Niles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CASON moved to amend the amendment by striking out the appropriation
                            for the Southern Prison.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ALLISON favored both amendments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CULLEN demanded the previohs question, and under its operation - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT demanded a division of the question.</p>
                        <p>The Senate refused to strike out the appropriation for Ihe Northern
                            Prison, by yeas 19, nays 24. The amendment to the amendment was also
                            rejected, by yeas 19, nays 23.</p>

                        <p>Mr. FOULKE submitted a preamble and resolution, reciting that Thomas F.
                            Howell was commissioned as a recruiting officer, and recruited nineteen
                            men who were accepted into the service, for which he has received no
                            compensation; and resolving that $114 be allowed to the said Howell for
                            such service, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FOULKE had presented a report of this case and it had been referred
                            to the <orgName>Committee on Claims</orgName>. He had seen the Adjutant
                            General and this claim would have been paid, but the money set apart for
                            that purpose had been exhausted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK suggested that it could be submitted as an amendment to the
                            specific bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. FOULKE then withdrew the resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved lor a dispensation to take up his Agricultural School
                            bill H. R. No. and make it the special order for 10 1/2
                            o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER thought it would be for the advantage of the Senate and the
                            Agricultural College itself not to locate the institution this session.
                            He moved to lay the motion on the table, but withdrew it for - </p>
                        <pb n="244" xml:id="VAA8558-08-244"/>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, who, though opposed to the bill, moved to amend by making
                            the special order at 11 o'clock A. M.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM stated that Wayne county had not yet been heard on the
                            consideration of this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD said: There was an understanding that when, by a majority, we
                            should agree upon a location, that we would act together for the
                            advancement of the best interests of the Agricultural College. Now, if
                            we did not set this college in operation this session, we could not
                            convene in time to do it, and the grant would be forfeited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM demanded the regular order of business - the hour of 10
                            o'clock having arrived.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK contended that, since the previous question had been
                            demanded, and the original motion was to suspend the order of business,
                            the demand for the order could not take precedence of his motion.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER held, that, under the rule, whatever motion is pending, it
                            gives way for the regular order at 10 o'clock.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK appealed from the decision of the Chair thus: "The Chair
                            having decided that a motion made by Mr. Buskirk to suspend the order of
                            business to take up House bill No. 6, is superseded by the call for the
                            regular order. From this decision we respectfully appeal to the judgment
                            of the House. Signed, S. H. Buskirk, Jason B. Brown." He argued the
                            point of order, coming to this conclusion, that if this decision was to
                            be adhered to, it would confine us to the order of bills in the
                            calendar, whether they are of public importance or not. He complained of
                            the ruling against him, and said that upon a bill of such public
                            importance as this we ought to be entitled to a vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE sustained the decision of the Chair, by reference to general
                            parliamentary law and the 27th rule of the House of Representatives.</p>
                        <p>The Clerk was directed to read the Senate's amendments - the Bradley
                            bill - and the same having been read - </p>
                        <p>The House refused to concur.</p>
                        <p>The Senate's disagrement of the House amendments to the Habeas
                            Corpus bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_196">S. No. 196</ref>.] coming
                            up - </p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. NEWCOMB, the House receded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH moved a dispensation to take up his Northern Prison bill, H.
                            R. No. 282, and put it upon its passage.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS moved that the motion be laid on the table, but immediately
                            withdrew it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Griffith's motion was lost - affirmative 30, negative 41.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said his was not an ordinary resolution, but a motion to
                            suspend the order of business.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. Then his authority did apply.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER felt it was of greater importance to decide this case now
                            than at any other period of the session; especially since the gentleman
                            has just reported some 70 or 80 bills, of which a large number are
                            distinguished as bills of public importance, if the Chair consents to
                            overstep the rules, and allow a matter, not of supreme importance, to
                            get in the way of public business, it would be doing a public wrong. He
                            submitted to the House that this question was decided at the last
                            session. [He read the 53d rule.] Under this rule, till the hour of 10
                            o'clock, these things can be done viz: <list type="simple">
                                <item n="1">Introdnction of bills.</item>
                                <item n="2">Reports from Committees.</item>
                                <item n="3">Resolutions, joint resolutions and bills.</item>
                            </list> The Chair has steadily held that motions were but unwritten
                            resolutions. If the Chair is correct in this, the gentleman's
                            motion simply proposed a resolution of the House that the rules shall be
                            suspended for a particular object. But when the hour of 10 o'clock
                            arrived, nothing was left in order but for the House to proceed to the
                            regular order of business, under the 54th Rule, which he read. The Chair
                            rehearsed and defended its former rulings in similar cases, and
                            justified the same at some length; and he submitted his especial
                            justification in the pendency of bills to adjust the public debt, to
                            provide for the public revenue and for the purposes of education,which
                            ought not to lose their places for the consideration of bills of
                            subordinate importance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS moved for a dispensation to take up the consideration of the
                            bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_293">S. No. 293</ref>] to prpvicie for
                            the periodical-enumeration of the white male inhabitants of this State
                            over 21 years of age, and prescribing penalty.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM from the <orgName>Committee of Conference</orgName> on the
                            disagreeing vote, between the two Houses, as to Senate amendments to the
                            House Committees bill, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">No. 285</ref>,
                            to provide a State debt sinking fund, etc., reported an amendment of the
                            same by way of substitute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. This measure embodies both bills - that reported from the
                            joint committee, and that from the Senate: and he believed that it meets
                            the views of both parties to a great extent. We found that to come to
                            any result, we have to yield something. The war loan is provided for in
                            this bill by setting apart five per cent, of the twenty-five cents levy,
                            and they will all be redeemed by the first of May, 1867, if the holders
                            of the securities shall present them for payment. This bill provides
                            that the two and a-half per cent, stocks of the funded debt shall be
                            taken up first, and the five per cent, and the unpresented war bonds
                            afterwards. It provides that a tax of ten cents out of the 25 cents
                            shall be a State debt sinking fund, to pay the principal. It also
                            provides that the Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners shall be abolished
                            the 26th of January, 1867; and also that the office of State Agent in
                            New York shall be abolished as soon as the registered debt shall be
                            paid. The whole matter being well understood by the House, in order to
                            save time, he would move the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH objected strenously to the demand for the previous question.
                            Let the bill be made the special order for to-night at 7 o'clock.
                            He was averse to taking a measure' of this importance upon trust of
                            any single member, however worthy of consideration he may be.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM stated further that there was no provision for the issuance
                            of new bonds. Members could not be better informed of the matter of the
                            bill without printing; he therefore adhered to the demand for the
                            previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL and Mr. COFFROTH hoped the House would not second the
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM adhered to his demand; and there was a second - affirmative
                            56, negative 23.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL and Mr. BROWN demanded the yeas and nays on ordering the main
                            question, and it was decided in the affirmative yeas 59, nays 26.</p>
                        <p>The yeas and nays were demanded and ordered on the main question, viz:
                            Shall the bill pass? </p>

                        <p>Mr. BURWELL asked to be excused from voting, simply because he could not
                            understand the proposition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS made the point, that a motion to be excused from voting was
                            not in order after the main question has been ordered.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER stated that, though it was not in his own opinion correct,
                            yet under the precedent set by the House at the last session, he would
                            now rule the motion out of order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH then moved that the House adjourn, and demanded the yeas and
                            nays, and there was a second to the motion. [Ten members can second a
                            motion to adjourn.]</p>
                        <p>The House refused to adjourn - yeas 9, nays 79.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH stated that his opposition was not factious, nor was such
                            opposition contemplated, so far as he understood the feeling of the
                            minority. What he wanted was, simply the beggarly privilege of looking
                            into the bill to see what it is.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY saw that this filibustering would be continued if permitted by
                            the majority, and it was the duty of the House to act if the public
                            welfare demands the passage of this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. If gentlemen wish to make inquiry into the provisions of the
                            bill. He hoped that discussion would be permitted to that extent,
                            notwithstanding the stress of the previous question.</p>
                        <p>After further conversation - resulting in the understanding that a quorum
                            shall not be broken on this bill</p>
                        <p>On motion by Mr. BRANHAM, the subject was postponed and made the special
                            order for to-night at 7 o'clock.</p>

                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, had been warned to resist the passage of this bill.

                        <p>Mr. BURTON. He wished to make a motion, which might seem to come rather
                            late in the session; but he did it out of respect to numerous
                            petitioners. It would be recollected that the laboring men of the State
                            had petitioned the Legislature on the subject of adopting the eight hour
                            system. A petition in this matter, which he had presented, was referred
                            to the Committee on Agriculture, and he had waited patiently to hear the
                            report thereon from that committee, and seeing that this subject is
                            being agitated in both branches of Congress, out of respect to the
                            laboring portion of the people of Indiana, he would move that the

                        <p>Mr. HOGATE said the <orgName>Committee on Agriculture</orgName> had had
                            this matter under discussion, and agreed upon a report; and he had
                            prepared a report, which had, somehow, been misplaced and destroyed, but
                            he would renew and submit that report to-morrow.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM called up the special order the consideration of the report
                            of the Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes between the two

                                <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. 285</ref>, to provide a State

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH stated that he had been misrepresented in his remarks on the
                            sinking fund bill last evening. He had been represented, as though he
                            had reflected on the conduct of the President of the Board of Sinking
                            Fund Commissioners. He made no allusion to that estimable and honorable
                            gentleman. He did refer to one member of the Board, Mr. John Harrison,
                            who had boasted that he had made $10,000 out of the trust funds, which
                            fact could be abundantly proved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB said, Mr. Harrison did not put $100,000 in a rebel bank in
                            New York, which blew up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said he was not careful to make further charges in this
                            matter. With respect to the substitute, he understood that it levies
                            five cents on the $100 for the liquidation of the war debt; and takes 10
                            cents of the 25 cents to pay the principle of the landed debt,the
                            interest to be paid out o the general fund, and that it provides also
                            that the 2% per cents, be paid first, if the war debt does not come in
                            responding to advertisement. He desired merely to indicate his
                            opposition for reasons which he had heretofore urged upon this
                            floor.</p>

                            to establish the eastern boundary oi the county of Blackford of the was
                            taken up - amending the 8th section of the County Boundaries act.</p>
                        <p>On his further motion, the constitutional restriction was suspended -

                            to the third reading, and read the third time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHOAFF, of Jay, resisted the passage of the bill. The arguments for
                            this bill had failed to convince his mind that the management to change
                            this county line was entirely fair, Then his county, (Jay) from which
                            the bill proposed to strike off six square miles of territory, contained
                            less than 400 square miles; and the only pretext for the friends of the
                            bill was to show a mistake in the act affixing county lines. His people
                            looked to him now to defeat this bill. The people of those six sections
                            had been paying taxes in Jay county for sixteen or eighteen years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL said, all they wanted was to fix the boundaries of Blackford
                            county just as the law fixed it in 1839. The taxes of those six sections
                            were paid in Blackford till 1849. when, by a mistake in legislation,
                            those six six sections were set into the county of Jay. We ask for the
                            correction of that mistake. Blackford county contained but four
                            townships. Jay was twice as large.</p>
                        <p>Mr. ABBETT. The controversy being between two Democrats, and as a
                            Democrat was never known to lie, he was hardly prepared to vote on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILROY was opposed to disturbing county lines, and he thought the
                            House better let it drop.</p>
                        <p>The bill was rejected - yeas 34, nays 57.</p>

                            for the detection of horse-thieves and other felons, and for mutual
                            protection, &amp;c., and it was passed the first reading in the House

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH rose (he said) to a privileged motion. He moved to take up
                            from the table the Morgan raid bill, S. No. 15, and the report of the
                            Committee of Conference thereon. He did so, not because he was a friend
                            of the bill, for he was not; but because gentlemen desired a square vote
                            on the bill; and because he would not discourage these claimants from
                            going with their claims to the Federal Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK made the point that when a bill has been laid on the table,
                            and a motion to reconsider that vote has been laid on the table, it is
                            impossible to go back and reconsider.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER said the point was well taken, in a case where the action was
                            to lay on the table. And as for the motion of the gentleman from
                            Huntington, (Mr. Coffroth,) it could not be regarded as a privileged
                            motion. Mr. NEWCOMB then renewed the motion of Mr. Coffroth.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved to lay the motion on the table.</p>
                        <p>The latter motion was rejected - yeas 23, nays 40 - no quorum voting - </p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER directed the Clerk to call the roll, and a quorum answering - </p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB asked and obtained leave to withdraw his motion, for the
                            purpose of giving place to the consideration of the General

                        the offering of the resolution till the adjournment closed the proceedings
                        for that day; and that the resolution, having been read simply for

                                    and that it is the duty of the officers of the respective

                    <p>Mr. Coffroth objecting to the record, among other things, made this
                        statement: The journal shows that the gentleman from Floyd, myself and
                        others objected to the offering of the resolution. Our objection was simply
                        to the consideration of the resolution at that time, because it was
                        adjourning time for the House; and I stated at the time, that we would have
                        no objection to its consideration in the morning. The objection was not that
                        we were either in favor or against the resolution, but simply because there
                        was not time to consider it. This was the whole scope of my objection;
                        because at the time I was not fully advised of the character of the
                        resolution. I desired the House to consider the resolution fully, and
                        examine it carefully. Therefore I insisted on the adjournment, that the
                        gentleman might have a fair opportunity to offer it, and the House to
                        consider it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BUSKIRK this: The resolution is not properly on the journal, for the
                        reason that it was not read at the Clerk's desk. After objections had
                        been made, the gentleman from Wabash asked leave to read his resolution for
                        information, and he read it himself; and it was not afterwards read by the
                        Clerk at his desk. For this reason, in my judgment, the resolution is not
                        properly on the journal. I do not know now precisely what is the force of
                        the resolution, but if I gather it correctly, I think very likely I shall be
                        in favor of it</p>
                    <p>Some stormy debates preceding and pending the consideration of Mr.
                        Brown's motion, in which Messrs. DUNHAM, NEWCOMB and others took part,
                        necessarily crowded out at this time, will be set forth in order in the
                        BREVIER REPORTS. The yeas and nays were twice taken, and showed no quorum
                        voting - affirmative 27, negative 27; and pending this division of the
                        House, the closing business of the session was enacted by unanimous consent,
                        viz:</p>
                    <p>Mr. FOULKE, from a majority of the <orgName>Committee on

                        with the act for the protection of sheep, with a recommendation that it be
                        indefinitely postponed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BUSKIRK submitted a minority report.</p>

                        submitted a report - "to hang Jeff. Devis on the sour apple
                        tree."</p>
                    <p>These reports, and the serio-comic proceedings thereon, went to the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>Mr. FOULKE, from the <orgName>Special Committee on the Agricultural
                            College</orgName>, submitted a minority report, non-concurring in the
                        report of the chairman for the location at Bloomington.</p>
                    <p>Messages from the Acting Governor obtained corrections in the enrolled act of
                        the House, <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_187">No. 187</ref>, and the
                        appropriation of $3,467 83, for the balance of the amount assessed against
                        the State, on account of the Gettysburg National Cemetery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BUSKIRK moved a resolution of thanks to the Clerks, which was

                                        business men, whose duty it shall be to visit the State
                                        Prisons North and South, &amp; thoroughly investigate the
                                        books and accounts of the same; to compare the workings of

                        <p>Mr. COLLINS proposed to amend..by striking out "three," and
                            inserting "one,''? It constitute the committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER. One man alone could not investigate this matter as
                            satisfactorily as three. It is a matter of considerable public
                            importance to know how our Prison Affairs are managed. I cannot accept
                            the amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL. Neither the resolution nor the amendment should be adopted.
                            The Legislature in its wisdom has seen fit to appoint standing
                            committees on the State Prison North and the State Prison South';
                            and it was the duty of these committees to investigate the prisons and
                            the prison system, and recommend such legislation thereupon as they
                            think proper, These committees being properly constituted, he preferred
                            to act upon their judgment, rather than upon the recommendations of any
                            committee that might be appointed by the Governor. He moved therefore,
                            that the resolution and pending amendment be laid on the table.</p>

                        <p>So the motion was rejected; and the question recurred on the
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LOCKHART. He had been opposed to allowing the prison committees to
                            visit the prisons, on account of the difficulty of getting a quorum to
                            do business in the House; and the time that remains of the session would
                            not be sufficient to make any investigation. If he had been informed
                            correctlyand his information was from a gentleman having every
                            opportunity to be correctly informed of the condition, of the State
                            Prison Norththat prison certainly ought to be investigated. Its
                            management was an outrage upon the people of the State; and he would
                            support any proposition to appoint men to go there and investigate it.
                            This was not saying that the standiag committees would not do the work
                            as well; but the time would not suffice for them to do justice to the
                            case. And he would have this committee instructed to gonot to the
                            Warden's house and eat his dinners, but to the hotel for their
                            living, and act for the interests of the State. "For he had no
                            doubt that every corrupt influence would be brought to bear upon these
                            men. We want the facts reported - the stubborn facts - without fear or
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD, I do not know, really, but we ought to send up from this House
                            some instructions to the Governor; although, of course, he would be
                            perfectly free to obey them or not. Judging from the character of the
                            outside pressure here, the Governor would likely appoint none but
                            lawyers on this committee - and probably tbose who have already received
                            large shares of the patronage of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GROVES. I may be permitted, as a member of the <orgName>Committee on
                                the Southern Prison</orgName>, to say, that I examined this
                            resolution before it was offered, and I approved <pb n="254" xml:id="VAA8558-08-254"/> proved it. I am not satisfied that it is
                            in proper shape; but, that some investigation ought to be had in regard
                            to the management of the State Prisons is most evident. For, at every
                            session of the Legislature, we are called upon for large appropriations
                            for these institutions, which, I think, ought to be self-supporting. It
                            has been well observed, that, now, time will not admit of examinations
                            by the regular committees, such as ought to be made. And I believe it is
                            the desire of the present officers of the Southern Prison, that the
                            examinations, if made at all, should be made by competent persons. We do
                            not ask tor lawyers, in the rtsolution, but for competent business men.
                            I hope the House will pass the resolution, and that the committee will
                            be appointed ; and I have confidence in the Acting Governor, that he
                            will appoint men who.will make at satisfactory report. So that the next
                            Legislature will be able to legislate understandingly in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS. lam in favor of this investigation, but I would have it at
                            the least expense. I am perfectly willing that the Governor should
                            appoint ; and if he fail to appoint the right men we will hold him
                            responsible. If the Governor appoint three men on this committee, there
                            will be an expense of at least three thousand dollars. I believe that
                            one man, and one third the money would be sufficient for the work. The
                            standing committees, which ought to have investigated the State Prisons,
                            were refused the time to do so. These investigations ought to be made
                            with direct reference to the facts, and the question whether the State
                            Prisons ean be managed any better or not. For, if our State Prisons were
                            to fail, of becoming self-sustaining, I would vote to abolish the whole
                            system, and let each county provide for its own criminals.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB proposed to amend the amendment of the gentleman from Adams,
                            by inserting "two" instead of "one;" and thereupon
                            he demanded the previous question, but immediately withdrew it for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS. He trusted that the resolution would be adopted. Impressions
                            adverse and prejudicial to the management of the Prisons seemed to have
                            gone out into the community; and if true, or whether true or not, the
                            Prisons ought to be investigated and the facts made known. Especially
                            ought this resolution to be adopted, since, as has been remarked, the
                            regular committees have not had time to make the investigations. And
                            this proposed connilittee ought to be composed of men capable of
                            understanding books, and knowing what belongs to the building of a
                            prison - as, the price of building materials and the rates and terms of
                            contracts - matters which a committee of the Legislature might not at
                            all times be prepared to investigate fully. He did not believe that the
                            officers of the Northern Prison have acted corruptly, as repeatedly
                            charged on this floor; but he knew that a large amount of money has been
                            expended on that prison; and he knew also, that such a prison cannot be
                            built for a small amount of money: as he had stated on a former
                            occasion, prisons have been ejected in other States costing two or three
                            millions of dollars. He did not wish to make an extravagant outlay in
                            this direction, but we must have institutions of this kind insome
                            respects like our sister States. He objected to the amendment of; the
                            gentleman from Adams, [Mr. Collms,] and preferred a square vote on the
                            original resolution. As he took the floor with a pro-I mise to do so, he
                            renewed the demand for the previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COLLINS accepted the amendment of Mr. Newcomb.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER objected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH appealed to the gentleman from Marion to withdraw the
                            previous question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB declined to withdraw the demand.</p>
                        <p>There was a second to the demand, and the main question was ordered, viz:
                            Shall "three" be stricken out, and "two" inserted in
                            lieu?</p>
                        <p>Mr. STRINGER (being entitled to the floor under the Rules) said he had
                            but a single word. He had no more interest in this matter than any other
                            member. But it was most evident that an investigation should be made not
                            only of the books and accounts of the Prisons, but of the comparative
                            workings of the two Prison Systems. This was a matter of considerable
                            importance to the people of the State. As to the question whether one or
                            two men could do better than three, he considered that two would be
                            better than one, and three better than two. There should be at least
                            two, and they ought to be capable business men. Two would be more likely
                            to employ a clerk, and the clerk would cost as much as the third man on
                            the committee. It was due to the officers of the Prisons, as well as to
                            the people of the State at large, that these investigations should be
                            made; and they were nessary for the guidance of future legislation.</p>
                        <p>The House rejected the amendments; and then the resolution was
                            adopted.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER now directed the House to the consideration of the pending
                            report from the Special Committee on Mr. Newcomb's proposition for

                            Indiana. He moved to amend the resolution by striking out these words :
                            "And be directed."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Is not this Hospital on leased ground?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BKANHAM. What is the amount of the rent?.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. About $3.000.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. And are we to pay it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I do not propose to pay any rent at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. How are you to get out of it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. This Legislature has expressed its disinclination to make
                            any expenditure for a Soldiers Home: hence this resolution does not
                            contemplate paying rent, because there is no appropriation for it. The
                            entire scope of the resolution is, that the Governor may accept this
                            property as a gift. Those who probably will have this property in
                            charge, by permission of the Governor, will find some means of paying
                            the rent, But I do not know that the Sanitary Commission will occupy it
                            at all. They may; or they may not be turned out of the City
                            Hospital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Suppose they accept this property, are not they or we
                            responsible for the rent? It seems that the Hospital must be removed;
                            for, if not, then the whole of the property will belong to the owners of
                            the land. I am afraid we shall be "getting an elephant."</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Can't we sell the property?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Does the resolution authorize the Governor to sell?
                            Gentlemen talk about this property being worth three hundred thousand
                            dollars. I do not believe it would sell for fifty thousand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Perhaps not, if you force the sale. But the resolution
                            proposes to give the Governor a discretion. I move to add to the
                            resolution this further discretion to the Governor: "Or make such
                            other disposition of such property as to him may seem most advantageous,
                            for the benefit of such disabled soldiers."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM was sure that the owner of the land will not grant any more
                            privileges than he is obliged to;it belongs to the notorious Jesse D.
                            Bright. Mr. B. would incorporate this amendment: "The State shall
                            not be liable for rent."</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB would submit this further amendment, which would cover the
                            idea: "Provided, that no obligation which he may give shall bind
                            the State to pay rent for the General Hospital."</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN demanded the Special Order. But - </p>

                                        honorable body, I herewith transmit to you my report of the
                                        Stationery Account of the Officers and Members of the
                                        House.</p>
                                    <p>From the fact that purchases have been made for both branches
                                        of the General Assembly, the bills <pb n="256" xml:id="VAA8558-08-256"/> have been furnished to either
                                        House, dividing as near as possible the pro rata expense of
                                        both bodies. Many items upon the bills of stationery
                                        furnished the committees of the House, were used by the
                                        Senate, and vice versa, many articles upon bills allowed in
                                        the Senate, have been used by the House. Duplicate copies of
                                        all the stationery bills are upon file in the Library.</p>
                                    <p>You will find in the accompanying tables the various articles
                                        furnished to the members of the House each under the
                                        appropriate heads, and the total amounts carried out.</p>
                                    <p>It will be seen that the clerks of the House have managed
                                        their department with the most rigid economy having used,
                                        during the entire session, but $285.30.</p>
                                    <p>We have kept a faithful record of the account of each member,
                                        which may be seen in the Library by any one Who may wish to
                                        examine our books.</p>
                                    <p>Thankful for the expressions of good will received at your
                                        hands, and the free and friendly feeling that has existed
                                        between us in our mutual relations I am, as ever,
                                        respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>We had on hand in the Library, in the beginning of the Session, quite a
                            large amount of Stationery turned over by the Clerks of the last General
                            Assembly. This we exhausted before making any purchases. The combined
                            amount of Stationery, etc., furnished both branuhes of the Legislature
                            is $3271.49. The amount purchased, as per bills rendered, is $2744.85.
                            Thus leaving $526.64 furnished from paper on hand.</p>
                        <p>We have now in the Library about two hundred dollars worth of Stationery,
                            which, in addition to that placed upon the desks of members at the
                            opening of the session, will make near $1000 worth furnished from the

                        <p>Mr. COWGILL, in behalf of the Select Committee to which was referred Mr.
                            Branham's resolution in relation to the printing of the Adjutant
                            General's Report, asked and obtained unanimous consent to submit a
                            report thereon, which was read by the Clerk. It recommends the adoption
                            of the concurrent resolution from the Senate in relation to this matter,
                            described in page 230 of these REPORTS.</p>
                        <p>The report lies on the table under the rules.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL moved ineffectually to lake up the concurrent resolution from
                            the Senate on this subject.</p>

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH demanded the unfinished order, viz: the consideration of Mr.
                            Newcomb's concurrent resolution, authorizing the Governor to accept
                            the transfer of the United States General Hospital at Jeffersonville -
                            the question being on the adoption of Mr. Newcomb's amendment,
                            adding these words: "Or make such other disposition of such
                            property as to him may seem most advantageous for the benefit of said
                            disabled soldiers."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. Was it proposed that the Governor accept this Hospital and
                            turn it over upon any conditions?</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. It was to be accepted upon the same terms as the Tripler
                            Hospital was accepted by the State of Ohio. The Governor is to receipt
                            for it in the name of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. So it does not prove to be "an elephant," he did
                            not care fof the rest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK. If it should be desirable to lease the ground for a short
                            time, he supposed that the parties managing the institution could do so
                            for a small price.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. The whole of the matter is just this: If you do not make some
                            new arrangement, as a matter of course, at the expiration of the lease,
                            this property will be entirely under the control of the landlord. This
                            property can do the State no good, unless we remove it; and, if Governor
                            Morton will make some provision for the removal and sale, I will vote
                            for the resolution. I do not think that the amendment accomplishes the
                            object gentlemen have in view. It does not direct the Governor to
                            sell.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. He has a right to make such disposition as he pleases of
                            the buildings.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. I would like to hear the resolution read with the
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>It was read by the Clerk accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I have in my hand a copy of the lease of this property by
                            the owners to the United States Government. The Government rents the
                            entire 125 acres, and agrees to pay $25 per acre annually - which makes
                            the rent a little more than $3000. The lease has this condition: The
                            party of the second part reserves the right to remove all the buildings,
                            fencings, &amp;c., at the expiration of the lease, or to dispose of them
                            by sale or otherwise. The rule of the Common law requires that the
                            improvements of the tenant shall be removed during the term of his
                            lease. But this changes the principle of the Common law so that they may
                            be removed "at the expiration of the lease." This gives time
                            for removal of the buildings, &amp;c., after the expiration of the
                            lease. I have seen these buildings, and I know that the/have cost a
                            great deal of money. They all can be very easily removed, except the
                            Sewer. <pb n="257" xml:id="VAA8558-08-257"/> This property is within a
                            hundred yards of the corporate limits of the city of Jeffersonville.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH proposed to amend further by adding this: "Nothing
                            herein contained shall be construed so as to make the State liable for
                            the subsequent rent of the property."</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. It takes two parties always to make a bargain. This lease
                            expires before the next meeting of the Legislature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The lease expires the first of June, 1868. But there is a
                            further provision, that, if the General Government should need the
                            property longer, they may retain it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. The General Government no longer needing it, can they assign
                            that right to the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. No longer than the first of June.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Then on the first of June this property will fall to the
                            landlord. After that time the State cannot take any right in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. Suppose the State does not remove the property at the time,
                            will the State loose anything?</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM The State does not loose anything, but Mr. Bright and the
                            other parties, landowners with him, do. - But, as he indicated the other
                            day, he was utterly opposed to making an asylum, a home for soldiers,
                            within this State. Whilst he was entirely willing to give all the
                            assistance that may be necessary in the way of pensions, in all cases
                            where the United States Government does not furnisla a sufficiency for
                            the support of the soldier, yet he was unwilling to erect this proposed
                            Home. He had taken some little observation of the workings of these
                            Homes. You have one - a Seamans' Home at Evansville, and another at
                            Louisville; and they were both of them utter failures. The class of
                            suffering soldiers and seamen most entitled to the aid of the State,
                            were the very class that did not get it. He appealed to the gentleman
                            from Vanderburg, us to whether the advantages of the Marine Hospital at
                            Evansville have justified its expenses. There might have been use for it
                            during the war, but before that time he doubted whether twelve men in a
                            year have been relieved by it. Such institutions were failures for this
                            reason: These men want social life - the affections of home - the
                            associations of friends - the pleasures of mixed society - not the mere
                            hermitage of a place devoid of all these. - This resolution was but the
                            entering wedge. It proceeded upon the supposition, that the end which
                            can not be accomplished now, may be accomplished hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. He had before stated to the House, that there is a necessity
                            for something to be done for our disabled soldiers. The gentleman had
                            said he was opposed to a Soldiers Home: so would be torn, if such an
                            institution were not necessary. He had been to see this litfle
                            Soldiers' Home at this city. This Home was now supplying the
                            necessities of nearly fifty men - and they have applications for more -
                            men wholly disabled by the war, and having no family, no relative in the
                            world to look after them - some of them taken out of the County Poor
                            Houses: (he said it to the disgrace and shame of the counties where they
                            belong :) and, if we now frown down this institution, there would be
                            hundreds left in the same helpless condition whence these men have been
                            rescued. He stated a fact, that many of these men came out of the County
                            Poor Houses, the receptacles of all the vice and debauchery of the
                            country! He represented the entire success of the man-angement of the
                            Soldiers' Home by the Sanitary Commission, organized and maintained
                            by the voluntary benevolence and humanity of the State. And here were
                            buildings which the State can supply to this institution costing
                            nothing. And, if the State were to sell out this property at once, under
                            any circumstances, it could not go for less than fifty thousand
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM (in his seat.) If it is the intention to dispose of the
                            property, I say amen to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. That was the intention: and he would thank the gentleman for
                            any better language than he had offered to express the object. The
                            resolution proposes that the Governor may lease this property to a
                            private association: it proposes also, that he may do as he pleases with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. If you provide that he shall dispose of it prior to the
                            expiration of the term of the lease. I will not object.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. We do not know but the Association inay make terms with the
                            owners.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. What I want is this: That there shall be an absolute release
                            ef the State from responsibility ; for, otherwise, we know very well,
                            that the State will have to pay the rent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. No sir: there is no authority, no appropriation, no money,
                            to pay. The Governor may dispose of it, and report to the next
                            Legislature. That is all. We want to provide an Asylum for our wounded
                            and disabled soldiers. Of course, if these owners will not make terms by
                            which the Governor or the Association may hold this property where it
                            is, it will have to be sold. But, if they can make terms, the needy
                            soldiers will, at once, have a comfortable Home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS demanded the previous question; but gave way for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, who desired to amend by adding this; "And if the
                            Governor <pb n="258" xml:id="VAA8558-08-258"/> cannot make an
                            arrangement with the owners, without the State becoming responsible for
                            the rent, then he shall sell the property before the expiration of the
                            lease - the proceeds to be applied by him for the benefit of disabled
                            Indiana soldiers."</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. "Of which he shall report to the next General
                            Assembly."</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK accepted the amendment</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I accept that in place of the last amendment I offered.</p>
                        <p> The previous question was then seconded and the main question was
                            ordered, resulting in the adoption of the amendment and of the
                            concurrent resolution as amended without a division.</p>

                        <head rend="center">THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM.</head>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK called up the Special Order for this hour, viz: the
                            consideration of his preamble and concurrent resolution for the
                            appointment of a Joint Committee to consist of five members of this
                            General Assembly - three on the part of the House and two on the part of
                            the Senate - with authority to sit during the vacation of the General
                            Assembly, and take into consideration the Defects of the present
                            Judiciary System of the State, and report to the next General Assembly
                            such a system of Courts as shall tend to greater efficiency and economy;
                            said Committee to receive the same compensation as members of the
                            General Assembly - the State Librarian to provide them a suitable room
                            and stationery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HAMRICK proposed to amend by striking out "five" and
                            inserting "three" in lieu; so as to read: "Two [members]
                            from the House and one from the Senate."</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER moved to lay the subject on the table; but, upon importunity
                            of members, immediately withdrew tne motion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK had in his drawer a paper of facts and figures, (which he was
                            not now able to find) showing something of the expensiveness of our
                            Judicial System - the expenses of the Circuit and Common Pleas Courts,
                            the expenses for County Commissioners Courts, and of the Supreme Court,
                            including the cost of records, &amp;c. The preamble to the resolution,
                            he said, recites a fact, that we have in this State the most imperfect,
                            the most defective and expensive Judicial system of any State in the
                            Union. But it is also a fact that, at every session of the Legislature
                            an effort is made for the purpose of changing the system. During the
                            last session, the gentleman from Huntington [Mr. Coffroth] was chairman
                            of a committee of one from each congressional district, which devoted
                            weeks of time to a bill on that subject; but owing to the shortness of
                            the time of the session, they were unable to perfect the bill. And there
                            was uot a member of that committee - not a legal gentleman on this
                            floor, but would admit that this resolution involves a question of
                            economy. Thousands of dollars might he annually saved to the State and
                            the people by a change in our Judicial System. He estimated an annual
                            saving to the State of from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars, which
                            would be effected by the organization of a more efficient system. Herein
                            was the extent of his interest in this matter. He neither desired nor
                            expected himself to be placed on such a committee, but, if he were at
                            liberty to make the suggestion, he would respectfully ask that the
                            gentleman from Huntington be placed upon this committee, not only
                            because of his eminent qualifications and fitness for the position, but
                            because he had already spent some time in the investigation of the
                            subject.The expense of the committee would be small, especially if the
                            amendment of the gentleman from Putnam [Mr. Hamrick] prevail ; and their
                            report would furnish the next Legislature with a bill for this object,
                            prepared and perfect in all its parts,which could be taken up and acted
                            upon without any great delay.</p>

                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM concurred in the remarks of Mr. Buskirk regarding our Judicial
                            System as one of the most cumbersome and expensive in the world, and had
                            no doubt that it could be improved in everything so far as concerns the
                            expense of litigants and the administration of justice. But he must say
                            that he differed with the gentleman as to the mode of accomplishing this
                            object. He would not appoint a committee of the General Assembly: and he
                            alleged that no man entirely competent to revise our Judicial System
                            could afford to Serve for the pay which the gentleman proposes. He did
                            not know what that gentleman does, but as for himself, he could not
                            afford to go to the Squire's office and make an action without a
                            fee</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I do not go there at all</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Yes, sir. But if I have nothing else to do I will go to the
                            Squire's office and make five dollars if I can. My pride is not
                            above that. But even I could not be employed for five dollars a day. If
                            the resolution were to appoint a commission of about three of the best
                            jurists in the State, I would go for it with all my might. And, as the
                            General Assembly know who are the best lawyers, I would select them by
                            ballot or concurrent vote, He repeated his concurrence in the opinion,
                            that our Judicial System is the most defective, cumbersome and costly of
                            any Judiciary in the world ; that - it ought to be revised, and he had
                            no doubt that the State would be immensely the gainer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH also concurred in the opinion, that our Juclical System
                            needs mending. He thanked the gentleman from Monroe for the compliment
                            in the suggestion of his appoiantment; and he also concurred <pb n="259" xml:id="VAA8558-08-259"/> in the opinion of that gentleman, that he
                            was competent to discharge the duties required by the position; but he
                            was compelled to say, that, for personal reasons, he could not accept
                            the appointment. But other gentlemen of the House were more competent
                            than he.</p>
                        <p>He also rehearsed the reason for the failure of the report of the special
                            committee of last session, appointed to consider and report a new
                            Judicial System. It was impossible for them to do the work in the time
                            prescribed. The work would involve a revision of nearly the whole of the
                            Practice Code.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM suggested two members of the proposed commission - Hon. Joseph
                            E. McDonald and Col. Baker, Acting and Lieutenant Governor of the
                            State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. No better selections could be made than those named by the
                            gentleman from Floyd. It was utterly impossible for a committee of the
                            Legislature to devote sufficient time for this work. If any remedy was
                            to be obtained, it must be by means of such a commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. The best revision of the Statutes we have ever had was that
                            made by Gov. Bigger, Judge Test and George H. Dunn. He also considered
                            that five dollars a day is not a sufficient compensation for the service
                            of a farmer, a mechanic, or any competent business man. He coincided in
                            opinion as to the fitness of the nomination suggested by the gentleman
                            from Floyd, admitted the importance of the work, and since it was too
                            late for this body to provide compensation for the commission, he would
                            leave that to the succeeding Legislature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK.There are two McDonalds. The appointment of one of them was
                            suggested: did the gentleman understand which?</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. One of them is on the bench of the U. S. District Court, and
                            the other was a candidate for Governor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH suuggested that it is not in order on the floor to refer to
                            distinguished gentlemen by name.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said he was enabled, by the suggestion of one of these
                            gentlemen with whom he had spoken, to say to the House, that his
                            practice at this time is rather too extensive and profitable to allow
                            him to accept an appointment on such a commission; and that gentleman
                            suggests further, that, at this time, we can appoint no man outside of
                            our own body.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Henricksan the Chair) said: there was he thought, one
                            feature in the resolution involving an objection, - and doubtless it had
                            already suggested itself to the minds of gentlemen. Our power is simply
                            legislative; and the moment that departs from us, or we depart from
                            that, our power is simply advisory. Now, by concurrent resolution, it is
                            not possible for us to open the door of the Treasury and take money. The
                            third section of the tenth article of the Constitution declares, that
                            "No money shall be taken from the treasury, but in pursuance of
                            appropriations made by law." Therefore a concurrent resolution
                            alone cannot have any force whatever in this direction.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. It was decided by the <orgName>Judiciary
                            Committee</orgName>, that, where an appropriation has been made for
                            Legislative expenses, the House, by resolution, can direct payment for
                            services ordered. But the objection is well taken, because the
                            resolution ought to provide that the committee shall be paid out of the
                            appropriation for the expenses of this session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. One of the first acts of this session forbade the application
                            of any money to Legislative expenses, unless specified in the law.
                            Hence, it is not competent for the House, where appropriation has been
                            made for Legislative expenses, to turn round and apply it to any other
                            purpose by resolution.</p>
                        <p>But there is another consideration here. This thing cannot be done,
                            because our legislatve power is ended. We can do nothing. Our power now
                            is only advisory, unless it is for the perfection of a previous law by
                            us enacted, as the appropriation bills passed yesterday, The General
                            Assembly continues, it is true, without the Governor, because he forms
                            no part of it: but where an appropriation of money is made, it requires
                            the Governor's ratification. - He trusted that gentlemen would
                            insist on maintaining the authority of the good old constitution, - at
                            the same time admitting, that it is matter of regret, that, by joint
                            resolution, we have not made some provision whereby our Judicial System
                            may be reorganized, as this resolution contemplates.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. Would it not be competent for this Legislature to authorize
                            the revision, and leave it for a subsequent Legislature to pay the
                            expense? For we are now without power to appropriate money. We are
                            sitting here simply to receive messages from the Governor. We are a
                            Legislature without power. We may direct the Governor to appoint the
                            commission, but he is not compelled to obey the direction. We are robbed
                            of power. When the clock struck "twelve" last night, it stript
                            us of all legislative authority, unless convoked again by the Governor.
                            The resolution deserves the favorable consideration of the House;
                            therefore I move to strike out the two last clauses, and modify it so as
                            to let it stand simply as matter of advice to the Governor; and let the
                            commission receive what the next Legislature may please to give
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN. I move to lay the resolution and pending amendments on the
                            table.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. There was a matter to which he desired to refer - his
                            attention having been called to it by the gentleman from St. Jo. and the
                            gentleman from Delaware. Last night the Senate adopted an amendment to
                            the General Appropriation bill, by which they repealed that section of
                            the law of the last session which created the <orgName>Military Auditing
                                Committee</orgName>. He thought the discharge of this Committee was
                            injudicious at this time. That Committee had saved hundreds of thousands
                            of dollars to the State. Not a single claim audited by that Committee
                            had been rejected by the General Government. Being advised of the
                            Senate's amendment discharging this Committee, he was requested to
                            offer an amendment continuing their functions till March, to enable them
                            to dispose of the business now before them. He did so; and it was
                            adopted and went to the Senate. He was just now advised, that two
                            members of that Committee considered that amendment as a reflection upon
                            them. He desired therefore to say now, that nothing was farther from his
                            intention than to cast the slightest reflection upon the faithfulness,
                            integrity and ability wish which these gentlemen have discharged their
                            duties. The amendment was ottered simply to prevent injustice to the
                            soldiers. I regret very much, that the Senate did not adopt that
                            amendment, because, without it, so many soldiers of the State of
                            Indiana, who have hereetofore been looking to this Committee, have now
                            to look directly to the General Government for their claims</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. No member of the Auditing Committee should consider that
                            action of the House as implying any want of confidence in his integrity
                            or ability. - Gentlemen remember how it was. When it was observed that
                            the Senate had stricken out from the House bill the clause providing for
                            the continuance of that Committee, the gentleman from Monroe, (being at
                            the time surrounded by his crowds of friends, and hid from the eye of
                            the Chair,) stated to me, that he had an amendment to save cases before
                            the Committee, and, as a matter of accommodation to him, I took the
                            amendment from his hand through the crowd of hid friends, and offered it
                            for him. I regard the three-members of that Committee as highmind-ed
                            men, and I am sure that no member of thejlouse would have voted for that
                            amendment had he regarded it as a reflection upon either of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE, as a member of the Auditing Committee, had not regarded the
                            action referred to as any reflection upon himself or the Committee. In
                            fact, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Monroe, was moved, to
                            some extent, upon his suggestion. He desired to say to the House, that,
                            perhaps yet before we come to the final adjournment, this
                                <orgName>Auditing Committee</orgName> will submit a report: and, as
                            one of the members of that Committee, he desired that their conduct
                            should be carefully scrutinized. He had no fear that their action would
                            be condemned by the people that pay tfoe taxes. It would be found, as
                            stated by ihe gentleman from Monroe, tbat this Committee has saved
                            thousands upon thousands of dollars to the State of Indiana, It was for
                            this reason, and not that he was desirous of being here at $5 a day,
                            that he desired this Committee to be continued till March, because he
                            had no doubt that hundreds of dollars would be saved thereby.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS (in the Speaker's chair pro tem.) The objection to the
                            amendment was not on account of any supposed feeling on the part of the
                            House towards the Committee: for I am satisfied that no member of the
                            House will charge the Committee with acting improperly: but the
                            amendment permitting them to sit longer in order to close out their
                            business was a seeming implication as though they had not done the
                            public business in such a manner as to be willing for it to be closed
                            out by other hands. I do not and have not at any time charged any member
                            of the House with the intention to reflect upon the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL renewed his motion to take up his resolution; but - </p>

                                        same rule by other governments, it is the duty of the United

                                        them, to apply to such other governments, the same

                                on Federal Relations</orgName> to the fact, that, as one of the
                            members of the Committee on Federal Relations, during these two
                            sessions, he had never yet known the place where they met: and, as to
                            this particular report, he did not know that it had been made.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. It is not the fault of the Chairman of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. There is an amendment to the resolution proposed by the
                            gentle man from Floyd, which has not been read. It is to strike out
                            words in brackets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. In the first line of the second page strike out these words:
                            "And by means entirely adequate to effect it." - The reason he
                            moved to strike out these words is this: The resolution indicates a
                            disposition on our part, that, if it becomes necessary to involve the
                            country in war to maintain the doctrine of the resolution, we will do
                            so. He did not think it good policy to pledge ourselves faster than the
                            the times and circumstances require. "Sufficient unto the day is
                            the evil thereof." - We should be left free to declare and maintain
                            our policy as circumstances arise. - This was his reasen for the
                            amendment. - He would not now take up time in debate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT desired the vote; but he would not ask for the previous
                            question if any gentleman would, pursue the discussion. - The first
                            proposition in his resolution announced what he called the American
                            Doctrine. It was sometimes called the Monroe Doctrine. He preferred the
                            former designation, because, in Mr. Monroe's message to which the
                            name is referred, the doctrine is not very clearly indicated. Not long
                            afterwards it was announced with more clearness by Mr. Webster; and then
                            a good deal plainer by Gen. Jackson. - The words proposed to be stricken
                            out amount te this : In the original resolution we say, that we stand by
                            this American Doctrine, and intend to maintain it by adequate means. In
                            the proposition as it would stand with the amendment of the gentleman
                            from Floyd we say, that fwe will fetand by the doctrine, but we do riot
                            say how far we will stand by it. - The second proposition in the
                            resolution is what has long been conceded as public law amongst nations.
                            That is, all nations bear similar relations to the great family of
                            nations. It has the force of a contract resulting from a treaty, and
                            binds all to this : That if any two members of the family become
                            involved in war with each other, no other member of the family shall
                            take any part in the contest. By this, public law it is understood,
                            that, if we are engaged in civil dissensions, France, England, etc. are
                            bound to stand aside and give no aid to our enemy. They are to stand
                            aside until the new government; has gained a positive superiority, and
                            then the authorities of the rebellion may be admitted as a new nation
                            into the family. But, as our civil war resulted in the overthrow of the
                            rebellion, they were bound by this public law to keep their people out
                            of the controversy. But now, in our late civil dissension, France and
                            England both evaded this doctrine, and asserted in their diplomacy, that
                            they are not bound by it any farther than by any local law of their own.
                            The second proposition in the resolution is that we will stand by this
                            old principle of public lawthat we will keep our people out of the
                            quarrel to which we are no party. Then we say, What we concede to other
                            nations they shall concede to us: But, if other nations do not concede
                            this to us we will apply the same rule to them which they apply to
                            us.till they return to the acknowledgment of this old principle of
                            public law. - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM (in his seat.) In that I entirely concur.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. With regard to the amend ment proposed by the gentleman from
                            Floyd, he was not clear as to whether it would not be best to adopt it;
                            because, at this time, the effect of the resolution can be only
                            advisory: and he trusted, (for, any event, it could only have the weight
                                <pb n="262" xml:id="VAA8558-08-262"/> 2of an expression of our
                            opinion,) that the spirit of the resolution would be carried out by the
                            President of the United States; and it certainly would lose all its
                            offensive character, by yielding that much to the gentleman from Floyd.
                            But if the resolution doos not embody a vital principle of
                            Republicanism, he would be glad to liear the views of the gentleman from
                            Floyd. or any other gentleman, before the vote is taken.</p>
                        <p>VOICES. "Vote," "vote," &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mr. CHAMBERS and Mr. KILGOE demanded the yeas and nays, and they were
                            ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. The resolution as it now stands, says in advance, and under
                            all circumstances, that this government shall pledge itself "to
                            fight it out on that line:" in other words. Maintain the Monroe
                            Doctrine under all circumstances, by force of arms. He did not think we
                            ought to go that far, but wait till the time comes for action, and then
                            judge of the necessity of the case. His amendment admitted the strengest
                            assertion of the doctrine, but struck out that part by which we pledge
                            ourselves to maintain it by force of arms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. Some gentlemen here say they do not understand what would be
                            the effect of the amendment. I understand that the resolution, if
                            adopted as proposed to be amended, will be an attempt to drive
                            Maximillian from Mexico - by resolution. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Either way, it says, Drive him.</p>

                        <p>So the amendment was adopted, and the question recurred on the adoption
                            of the resolution as amended.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. I hope the resolution will pass. The Monroe Doctrine (as we
                            say) has been sound Democratic doctrine for forty-five years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM asked for a division of the question, and would give his
                            reasons for it. He had always been in favor of the Monroe Doctrine; and
                            he believed it the duty of this government - the controlling government
                            on this continent - to secure to all the people of this continent their
                            right to a republican form of government. He had always been in favor of
                            this Monroe Doctrine; but, so far us this proposition is concerned, in
                            the present aspect of the country especially in view of the course of
                            the present Congress he regarded it as a most consummate mockery. We say
                            here in this resolution, that it is the right of all people to govern
                            themselves; and we say that we will pledge ourselves to secure to the
                            Mexican people tbe right of a republican government, whilst this day we
                            are refusing to apply this doctrine to the people of the Southern States
                            of this Union, lately in rebellion, but who have been conquered and have
                            submitted; whilst we are this day crushing these States under the heel
                            of our power, and denying them all right of voice in this government -
                            and these are seven millions of our own peopleflesh of our flesh and
                            blood of our blood; whilst we are doing this, he regarded it as a
                            mockery to adopt such a sentiment as this resolution embodies. If this
                            resolution is not a mockery, then he could not understand what a mockery
                            is. Here are States which never had the right to secede but their
                            citizens went into rebellion simply as citizens - and now we have
                            compelled them to submit to the laws by the strong arm of the
                            government, and now, since they have submitted, so far are you from
                            saying to them that they are their own rulershave the right to control
                            their own affairs that you undertake to dictate government,
                            constitutions, laws, and institutions to them. And you call that a
                            republican government! It could'nt make much difference (he
                            thought) when we talk about tyranny, whether you have one tyrant, or
                            thirty. The most accursed tyranny in history was that of Venice, And
                            when thirteen millions of people undertake to crush out the liberties of
                            seven millions he did not say that the seven millions should not be
                            compelled to submit to republican government but when they do submit,
                            and when you say that the thirteen shall dictate to the seven their own
                            republicain government, you have got a tyranny - just thirteen millions
                            of tyrants instead of one tyrant. And, So help me God, I would rather
                            have the one. For, when you have got but one, you can hold him
                            responsible, as one that you can strike. But when you have got thirteen
                            millions, you have got a many-headed monster that you cannot strike. Now
                            you give it out to tht world, that you will defend republican government
                            in Mexico, whilst you give to these submissionists at home no republican
                            government! Whilst he was in favor of the doctrine of the resolution, he
                            was unwilling to hold up his hands in this hypocritical way before the
                            world. -- For this reason, he asked for a division of the question. He
                            would like to speak more at length, if his strength would permit; but he
                            had not been able to sit up for'the last twenty four hours. But
                            when the gentleman introduced <pb n="263" xml:id="VAA8558-08-263"/> the
                            resolution - the first one - it it struck him as a most consummate
                            mockery: giving out, Don Quixotte-like, that we will secure the
                            liberties of a race of foreigners, that have no sympathy in common with
                            us, - and yet the gentleman and his friends are advocating a policy that
                            crushes out the liberties of one-half of our own countrymen!</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM. The gentleman from Floyd appears to concur with the gentleman
                            from Wabash in his endorsement of the Monroe Doctrine; but whilst he
                            does so, he seems to be so bound down with party ties, that he cannot
                            avoid a feeling of opposition to the passage of the resolution The
                            Republican party, together with all, good and true Democrats, have
                            rescued this Union from the hand of Rebellion, and forced the Slave
                            Power to succumb thank God! - to succumb forever. And now it behooves
                            this government to stand forward and before all others, to secure the
                            boon of Liberty, not only to all within her own borders, but to all men,
                            of whatever race or crime, throughout the world. Does not the gentleman
                            know, that if these lately rebellious States were not held down by the
                            hand of power, they would again rebel ? Does he not know, that they
                            still hate the Union, and the Cause of Liberty and Freedom to all
                            mankind as much as when they first instituted the rebellion? There is
                            then no inconsistency in Union men advocating the Monroe Doctrine, and
                            its extension over the earth - advocating the support and maintainance
                            of their own institutions, especially upon the American Continent. There
                            is nothing inconsistent with this doctrine in the history of our, party.
                            It is in accordance with the principles we have alweys expressed, to
                            deprecate all interference on the part of foreign despots with
                            republican institutions upon American soil.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN demanded the previous question; but immediately withdrew it
                            for - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN, promising to renew the demand when he shall conclude. Whilst
                            he agreed generally in the facts submitted by the gentleman from Floyd,
                            he could not agree with that gentleman as to the course of conduct he
                            marks out. That gentleman starts out with an admission, that the
                            resolution, in principle, is correct; but he says the resolution ought
                            to be voted down, because the Congress of the United States is not
                            governed by its principles! Sir, I am happy to see gentlemen belonging
                            to the party, which the gentleman from Floyd charges with being guilty
                            of the crime of violating the principles of this resolution, coming
                            forward here with propositions for the support and maintainance of those
                            principles which, for the last forty-five years have been maintained and
                            supported by the Democratic party. The only question with me here is
                            this: Is the resolution right in principle? If it is, I shall vote for
                            it. I care not whether the practice of men charged with the
                            administration of the government be different or not; if the principle
                            be correct, the government should uphold and maintain it. And, whether
                            the government be doing so at this time or not, is not a consideration
                            that should govern the conduct of men when brought to the test as to
                            whether we do or do not endorse the principle. If the gentleman from
                            Floyd desires to place the mark of condemnation upon those men who are
                            administering this government, because they are not conducting
                            themselves towards our fellow-citizens in conformity with the spirit or
                            this resolution, in my judgment, it would be the better way for that
                            gentleman to make it an original proposition, and let the House express
                            its sense upon, it. But I do not understand how gentlemen can do justice
                            to themselves - I do not think this resolution can be treated with the
                            consideration to which it is entitled - if we are compelled to govern
                            nor votes upon it by the conduct of the officers of this government. The
                            only thing that ought to govern our votes should be our consciences in
                            determining the question whether the principle contained in the
                            resolution is right or wrong. Principles are eternal, whilst the actions
                            of men are vascillating, and inconstant, and sometimes infamous. That
                            which is right will speak for itself in this resolution. A government of
                            right principles, in my judgment, will stand out and vindicate itself, 1
                            care not who may undertake by bad conduct to cover it up. If others are
                            not pursuing the course of public conduct which this resolution demands.
                            I hope gentlemen will not so far blind and stultify themselves, as, for
                            that reason, to vote against the resolution - I now renew the demand for

                        <p>On motion by Mr.BRAHAM, the House now took up the concurrent resolution
                            from the Senate for the printing and distribution of the Adjutant
                            General's Report, authorized by resolution of the last Regular
                            Session. [See Senate Proceedings of December 19.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGlNS. I move to strike out the fifteen hundred copies that are to
                            be sold by the Librarian. I do not want the State to embark in the Book
                            Business, that is a branch of business which I do not think properly
                            belongs to the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SHUEY was informed by a soldier now in town, that all the Indiana
                            officers and Soldiers of the war are waiting anxiously to get this
                            Report. It seemed to him that the number, 1,500 copies, was too small
                            for the demand. He hoped that at least this number of these books would
                            be furnished tor the class of purchasers he had indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren. When he went home last Saturday, the first
                            inquiry that was made to him was whether these books can be bought? He
                            gave his volume to Maj. Weldon. The boys are all anxious to have them. I
                            move the previous question.</p>
                        <p>There was a second for the demand, and the main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. I will suggest, that the Committee at first, determined to
                            strike out fifteen hundred; but the demand for books appeared to be so
                            great as to leave no doubt, that they would every one be taken up as
                            soon as the edition Is printed. There can be no more copies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. Is the work stereotyped?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BiiANHAM. It is not stereotyped.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HIGGINS' amendment was rejected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GLEASON. I think it would be very wrong indeed to deprive our citizen
                            soldiers of the poor privilege of purchasing this Report</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER (Mr. Henricks in the Chair.) The amendment is not adopted.
                            The question is on the adoption of the resolution.</p>
                        <p>The resolution, was adopted without a division.</p>

                        <p>Mr. COWGILL submitted a concurrent resolution for inquest into the
                            management of the Sinking Fund by the commissioners thereof - whether
                            any profits have enured to any member of said Board of Commissioners by
                            the neglect or unauthorized use of the moneys belonging to said fund,
                            &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER proposed to amend by way of substitute,authorizing and
                            instructing the Governor to appoint three discreet persons to inquire
                            and report to the Governor of the State live particulars in regard to
                            the management and use of the sinking fund by the President and Board of
                            Commissioners thereof.</p>
                        <p>[Both the resolution and substitute were read by the clerk too rapidly
                            for sketch.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH said if he had heard them aright, the five propositions of
                            the substitute met his approbation. He preferred the request that, in
                            the appointment of this Committee, the party which at the last election
                            was shown to be in the minority in the State, (but which he believed was
                            now in the majority,) should not be entirely ignored, as was the case in
                            the appointment by the Speaker of this House of the <orgName>Military
                                Auditing Committee</orgName> and the Committee on the Adjutant
                            General's Report. He made this request on the behalf of the seven
                            or eight hundred thousand Democrats actually represented on this floor,
                            as well as on the behalf of the President (Mr. Talbott) and one of the
                            remaining four members [Mr. Ricketts] of the Board of Commissioners,
                            Unless this Committee can be made into shape suph as that the minority
                            can have some show, everything that may come from it will have a show ot
                            distrust. Evening before last, in discussing the Sinking Fund bill, he
                            made the statement, that one of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund
                            [Mr. Harrison] having under his control a hundred thousand dollars
                            belonging to this fund, had used it for his own benefit and realized a
                            profit of $10,000. Mr. Aquilla Jones, was his informant, that Harrison
                            admitted to him that he had made $10,000 in this manner. He thought he
                            was entirely justified in making the statment on the authority, of Mr.
                            Jones, who is known in this community as a hightened, honorable
                            gentleman, and as having occupied high and responsible positions ot
                            honor and public trust. But since that time Mr. Jones had come to him
                            and informed him that Harrison had seen him and satisfied, him, that on
                            the former occasion he had misunderstood Mr. Harrison; and Jones as an
                            act of justice to his neighbor, now requests that this statement be made
                            on this floor, that he had misunderstood Harrison as to the saying that
                            he had made ten thousand dollars out of the use of this fund <pb n="265" xml:id="VAA8558-08-265"/> He would do injustice to no man - friend
                            or foe - political friend or political enemy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM also explained that he had understood the other night, that
                            these Commissioners felt it to be their duty, tinder the laws and the
                            action of the Legislature at the last session, not to loan this fund,
                            and that they had made these deposits acting under what they supposed
                            was the desire of the Legislature, and for the best interests of the
                            State. In his remarks on the Sinking fund bill, he now stated to the
                            House that he indulged no intention to cast censure upon the Board of
                            Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, or any member thereof.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. If the Legislature, at the last session indicated anything,
                            was it not that this fund should be put into the bonds of the State?</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I wish to amend the resolution, so as to say, that one of
                            the three shall be a Democrat,or, that they shall not all belong to the
                            same political party.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. I am authorised to say for the Lieut. and acting Governor,
                            that he will appoint a Democrat on that Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. If Governor Baker says so, that is enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. I have no desire to censure any one, for I have no reason to
                            do so: still, if any were deserving of censure, I would not withhold it.
                            What I said was to vindicate a friend from what I considered an attack
                            upon him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB wished this investigation of the Sinking Fund. The other
                            night he did censure some of the members of the Board for using this
                            money in bask - he said they were not bankers for the State, He would
                            say this for Mr. Harrison, that he has been exceedingly liberal in times
                            when the State needed money. The House of Harrison &amp; Co. he

                        <p>After further explanations with reference to the deposit by Mr. Ricketts
                            of $160,000 in the House of Lyons &amp; Co., by the advice of the
                            President of the Board, &amp;c., and Rickett's declaration of
                            refusal to settle till certain outside speculations in gold shall be
                            closed out, &amp;c., in which Messrs. NEWCOMB, HIGGINS, DUNHAM,
                            COFFROTH, and BRANHAM took part - from which it appeared that the
                            pending resolution had come from a Committee of the two Houses which had
                            been in consultation with the President of the Board of Sinking Fund
                            Commissioners - </p>
                        <p>Mr. WOODS demanded the previous question, and there was a second, and the
                            main question was ordered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COWGILL. My purpose in introducing the resolution was, that
                            theremight be an investigation in regard to the manner in which these
                            funds have been used, and for whose benefit. It was drawn hastily, and
                            requires amendment. I am willing to accept the substitute offered by the
                            gentleman from Tippecanoe [Mr. Miller.] I have this further to say in
                            regard to the matter: I am satisfied that the duty of these officers was
                            plainly prescribed by law; and the report made by the President of the
                            Board of Sinking Fund Commissioners must show to the satisfaction of
                            every one, that they have not discharged their duty, as the law
                            required; and therefore I think it proper that there should be an
                            investigation. At a time like this. when the State is deeply involved in
                            debt, it cannot be right, that nearly $800,000 of the funds belonging to
                            the State should be idle for three or four yearsnot earning anything for
                            the State, As far as the appointment of the Commissioners is concerned,
                            I am willing to trust that to Governor Baker: and if he can find a
                            Democrat in all the State whose loyalty is unquestioned - and if there
                            is one I think he can find him - I have no objection to his
                            appointment.</p>
                        <p>The resolution, as amended was then adopted.</p>

                                        1865 and thereafter; and that it is the duty of the officers

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I would be in favor of the resolution if we could possibly
                            pass it. Let it pass over now, and we will call it up in the morning,
                            and take a vote on it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT, I have been at some pains to inquire and look into the
                            statutes to show that the law does not - </p>
                        <p>[Interrupted by cries of "Order," and "Nothing before the

                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker. I rise to a question of order. I say the
                            gentleman's remarks are out of order, because there is nothing
                            before the House.</p>

                        <p>The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Wabash is entitled to the floor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. I rise to a question of order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. Mr. Speaker, I have offered a resolution - </p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. But it has not been received.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER, The gentleman from Wabash will proceed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Speaking over interruptions by Mr. Dunham and others standing
                            up and demanding to be heard on the order.) Does the gentleman suppose
                            that what has been asserted here in my absence is law? - I am prepared
                            to show, that the change of the law of 1863 was for the very purpose of
                            conferring the power upon the States to tax the General Government bonds
                            when used as bank stock.- </p>
                        <p>Interruptions by Mr. DUNHAM, Mr. BROWN and others suppresed the remarks
                            of Mr. Pettit. - When the authority of the Chair prevailed, and
                            gentlemen were seated in order - </p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH, insisted on his motion to adjourn, which was lost on a
                            division showing no quorum.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. I demand a call of the roll, or to be heard hereby a
                            quorum.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER directed the clerk to call the roll.</p>
                        <p>Mr. SIM moved an apjournment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. All I can say is, - I can not maintain the floor if the House
                            is not willing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. I am not willing - </p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. It is for the very reason that the gentleman is unwilling,
                            that I am in the habit of yielding.</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN moved an adjournment.And then (at 5.30 p. m.) the House

                        <p>The PRESIDENT <hi rend="i">pro tem.</hi> then said:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Gentlemen of the Senate:</hi> Before I adjourn you I must be
                            permitted to say a few words. I have no set speech. It is not necessary.
                            My nature and habit is to extemporize whatever I may say upon an
                            occasion like this. And I say to you now from the sincerity of my heart
                            that language is inadequate to express to you the kindness I entertian
                            towards you individually and collectively. You have manifested always a
                            forbearance towards me; and I have attempted to faithfully discharge the
                            duties of presiding officer of the Senate. If I have not given to every
                            Senator an opportunity of expressing his views or introducing his
                            measures in this body I can appeal to God who will judge us all in tho
                            great day, that it has not been intentional, for you are my equals, you
                            have treated me kindly, and why should I not treat you kindly?</p>
                        <p>We assembled under auspicious circumstances and we adjourn under
                            surroundings still more favorable : and I may be permitted to say,
                            without reflecting upon the vote of any Senator on one of the
                            mostimportant measures that came before this body that 32 years ago,
                            whether right or wrong, I gave my vote for the initial step in the great
                            system which I am proud to say brought down upon its supporters a great
                            deal of abuse, bnt it was the entering wedge to the great system which
                            has made this State in times of peace prosperous and happy, and in times
                            of war strong and patriotic. And now I have lived to be present as a
                            number of this body and presiding in it when the State debt was to be
                            adjusted, and I have been suffered in the providence of God to be
                            present and to aid, as far as any vote would go, in the adjustment of
                            that debt. And I am proud to say, whether it is adjusted in the best
                            manner it could have been or not, Indiana is out of debt. You understand
                            what I mean: we have an arrangement made which l think will be
                            satisfactory to our bond holders and creditors - we have an arrangement
                            by which a great amount of the debt can be liquidated and bonds issued
                            satisfactory to them in view of the residue. True we will owe something
                            to our own people, but of that the principal is not required; the
                            interest is all that is required, and that will be paid.</p>
                        <p>And I am proud to say that the school fund was brought about to a great
                            extent by another measure which in 1832 I had the honor to support - and
                            that is the old State Bank. I voted for it and lived to see it wound up
                            creditably, having accumulated a fund which remains for the benefit of
                            the present and future generations.</p>
                        <p>I will not detain you, gentlemen, with further remarks, though I will not
                            pronounce the Senate finally adjourned till a message is received from
                            the House of Representatives, but I wish to say that you have my kindest
                            regards, and that at any time in the 24 hours of any day, till I shall
                            have taken my departure from this earth, I shall think of you with
                            gratitude and kindness, and through storm or sunshine I shall be willing
                            to go to accommodate any Senator. I trust you will return home in good
                            health, and be received warmly and kindly by your constituents, who will
                            say to you "well done, good and faithful servants, our confidence
                            in you has not been misplaced." [Applause.]</p>

                    <p>The SPEAKER, called the House to order at 9 1/2 a.m. and directed the Clerk

                    <p>Mr. BROWN objected.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I do not want to take up time with the journal. There are
                        several reports from Committees that ought to be made this morning.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BURWELL The journal ought to be read.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The clerk will report the first rule of the House for the
                        order.</p>
                    <p>The Clerk read:</p>
                    <p>"1, He shall take the chair every day precisely at the hour to which the
                        House shall have adjourned on the preceding day; shall immediately call the
                        members to order; and, on the appearance of a quorum, shall cause the
                        journal of the preceding day to be read, unless, by a vote of the House, the
                        reading of the journal be dispensed with."</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker. I rise simply to make an inquiry. I may be mistaken,
                        but I understand that the resolution offered by the gentleman from Wabash
                        [Mr Pettit] at the time of the adjournment, yesterday, (which appears on the
                        journal) was read by that gentleman simply for information: if that be true,
                        I submit that the resolution ought not to be on the journal. I submit that
                        nothing should go on the journal, except it has been before the House.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The Clerk will report that portion of the journal for the
                        information of the House.</p>
                    <p>The CLERK read from tke journal beginning with Mr. Pettit's motion to
                        offer a resolution.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Coffroth moved an adjournment."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pettit asked Mr. Coffroth to withdraw his motion that the following
                        resolution might be read for information."</p>
                    <p>[Here follows in the journal Mr. Pettit's resolution relative to the
                        taxing of the Shares of National Banks, printed in the close of the House
                        proceedings of yesterday.]</p>
                    <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Is the resolution there? It is no part of the record, and I move
                        that it be expunged.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN. I have just consulted the gentleman from St. Joseph, [Mr.
                        Henricks,] who was in the Chair at the time, and he says the resolution was
                        read simply for information, and ought not to be in the journal, I insist
                        that the resolution could not have been offered at the time the gentleman
                        from Wabash undertook to offer it. The House was not in a condition to
                        consider it. and therefore it could make no part of the record. It was
                        simply read for information in order to see whether objection would be made
                        to it.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The pending question is on the motion to dispense with the
                        reading of the Journal.</p>
                    <p>Mr, DUNHAM. There is a prior motion. I move that the journal be corrected by
                        striking this resolution from it. I want to say, that I regard its
                        appearance on the jonrnal as a most disgraceful proceeding on the part of
                        the Speaker now occupying the Chair, whose duty it is to see that the
                        journal is correct. I undertake to say - and the Speaker will not pretend to
                        deny it - that matter which is read simply for information is not before the
                        House, and, if not received, cannot go upon the journal. The resolution was
                        read for information, simply to see whether it should be permitted to come
                        before the House. The House did not permit it: and the record is an outrage
                        upon everything right and decent in parliamentary action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Sir, I have sat here for two sessions and heard enough of the
                        blackguarding abuse of that gentleman toward the Chair. Mr. Speaker, it is
                        an outrage upon the House, that the gentleman from Floyd sets here and
                        persists, day after day, in using such opprobrious epithets - </p>
                    <p>Mr. DUNHAM interrupting. You are a liar when you say it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. You are an infernal blackguard when you speak - </p>
                    <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Any old woman can hurl back epithets - [''Order,
                        order," and members rising.]</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER (using the hammer.) All gentlemen will be seated and observe
                        order.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN. I move to amend the motion to dispense with the reading of the
                        journal, by striking out that portion which has been read by the Clerk.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. It is not an amend ment. The motion will be in order, if the
                        House should decide to dispense with the reading.</p>
                    <p>The reading of the journal of yesterday was then dispensed with.</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN. I now move that the journal be corrected, by striking out that
                        portion which relates to the resolution offered by the gentleman from
                        Wabash.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman indicate in writing what portion of the
                        journal he would strike out?</p>
                    <p>Mr. BROWN The part which was read by the Clerk.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I would be glad to have the reading of that portion of the
                        record which follows immediately after the resolution.</p>
                    <p>[Here Mr. DUNHAM advanced across the House to the desk of Mr. NEWCOMB, and
                        there were between them some words of altercation not heard at the
                        reporter's desk, which seemed to be arrested by the interposition of
                        the Doorkeeper.]</p>
                    <p>Mr.LOCKHART (looking towards the Doorkeeper, and the parties in altercation.)
                        Mr. Speaker, I hope gentlemen will be called to order.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. All gentlemen will be seated and keep their places. Gentlemen on
                        the right of the Chair will be seated. Gentlemen on the left of the Chair
                            <pb n="269" xml:id="VAA8558-08-269"/> will be seated. All gentlemen will
                        be seated and observe order, - The gentleman from St. Joseph was in the
                        Chair, on yesterday, when the motion was made for this resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I think the motion of the gentleman from Jackson ought to
                        prevail. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely deprecate any unpleasant feeling on the
                        floor at this time. We have had throughout the session, a pleasant time.
                        There has been nothing that has caused any unpleasant feeling with me. And I
                        trust that we will all go from this place with good feeling towards each
                        other - with the remembrance of nothing to injure personal relations - that
                        we will go home in peace - acknowledging each to all. that, although we have
                        differed in politics, we have differed honestly. But Mr. Speaker, I must
                        say, that I think the journal here is improperly made up. I do submit, sir,
                        that, if I, in my place, offer a resolution, not in order, that it does not
                        go upon the journal. And if my resolution is read for information, still it
                        does not go upon the journal. A speech or an argument is made for
                        information, and speeches and arguments do not go upon the journal. Nothing
                        goes upon the journal, except what is received and acted upon by the House,
                        I may be in error, but, in my judgment this paper is not properly upon the
                        journal. I made the motion to adjourn; and whilst I was upon the floor, I
                        was requested to give way for a resolution by the gentleman from Wabash. I
                        declined, but consented to give way so far as to hear the resolution read.
                        Instead of being offered to the House for information, it was simply read
                        for my hearing, to ascertain whether I would give way for its
                        introduction.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair begs to say, that under the Rules of the House the
                        Speaker, is required to correct the journal, and he has at all times
                        endeavored to make a fair journal. And the course pursued in this instance
                        is conformable to usage here. For example: last Monday, the gentleman from
                        Monroe took the floor and moved for leave to submit a resolution to
                        authorize the reference of a large number of bills to a special committee,
                        and the journal shows the facts in this order.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COFFROTH. But, in this instance, I gave the floor to hear the resolution,
                        but declined to give way for its introduction.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The question must finally resolve itself into one fact: Whether
                        the gentleman from Huntington, by waiving the motion to adjourn, did not
                        also waive his right to the floor: and the Chair thinks there can by no
                        doubt of that. The next question is whether the gentleman from Wabash asked
                        the gentleman from Huntington to give way, and whether he did give way : and
                        there certainly can be no doubt of that. The motion to adjourn was lost by
                        waiver; and the gentleman from Wabash then offered the resolution. And then
                        the House adjourned. The purpose of the journal is to tell the truth about
                        what is done by the body.</p>
                    <p>Mr. HENRICKS, I desire to say, that I do not understand that the resolution
                        went upon the journal by the motion to enable the gentleman to introduce the
                        resolution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COFFROTH. A call of the House was demanded, and, thereupon, the question
                        on the motion to adjourn was taken by a division of the House and that
                        division showed no quorum present. A call of the House was then ordered by
                        the Chair and the clerk still reporting No quorum present, no motion could
                        be made.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The proposition was introduced before the call of the House.</p>
                    <p>Mr. COFFROTH. The vote on the motion to adjourn discovered no quorum present
                        when, of course, no business could be done: and, as it was the duty of the
                        Chair to do so, a call of the House was ordered.</p>
                    <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair begs to say again, that the gentleman from Wabash was
                        upon the floor when the motion to adjourn was made; and that being waived,
                        he took the floor and offered the resolution: he insisted on maintaining the
                        floor, and did maintain it for that purpose. Then, afterwards, the occupant
                        of the Chair, seeing there was no quorum present, ordered a Call of the
                        House.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN now submitted, in writing, his motion "To strike from the
                            journal of yesterday all that part which makes reference to the
                            resolution which the gentleman from Wabash attempted; to offer to the
                            House, which resolution relates to the authority and propriety of this
                            State taxing stock owned in National Banks in the State of Indiana,
                            beginning with; the words 'Mr. Pettit,' &amp;c., and ending
                            with these words : 'The Speaker ordered a Call of the
                            House.'"</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. With the indulgence of the House, in relation to this
                            matter of the correction of the journal, I wish to make this statement:
                            The journal shows that the gentleman from Floyd, myself and others
                            objected to the resolution. Our objection was simply to the
                            consideration at the time - as it was adjourning time. I stated at the
                            time, that we would have no objection to the consideration in the
                            morning. The objection was not because we were either in favor of the
                            resolution or opposed to it; but simply because there was not time to
                            consider it. This was the scope of our objection; because, at the time,
                            I was not fully advised of the character, of the resolution: and there
                            was not time then to consider it fully and examine it carefully.
                            Therefore I would have the adjournment, that the gentleman might have a
                            fair opportunity to offer this resolution, and we to examine it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I desire to suggest, in reference to the matter now pending,
                            that the resolution is not properly on the journal, for the reason that
                            it was not read at the Clerk's desk, After objection was made, the
                            gentleman from Wabash asked leave to read his Resolution, for
                            information: and he readmit: and it was not afterwards read by the Clerk
                            at the desk. For that reason, my judgment is, that the resolution is not
                            properly on the journal. I do not yet know what the resolution is. I
                            could not gather its import feom the reading. I think it very likely I
                            should be in favor of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brown's motion to amend the journal was again read by the
                            Clerk.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I rise to a question of privilege. I am just informed that
                            the Specific bill does not contain the appropriation of the balance of
                            the amount assessed against the State for the Gettysburg Cemetery. I
                            think, there can be no question of the fact that we have passed that
                            appropriation. There has probably been a mistake in the enrollment ef
                            the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. On examining the bill I find nothing of the kind, either in
                            the original bill or in the amendments. The paper must have been lost
                            before it came into the hands of the Enrolling Clerk.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, I yield to the gentleman.</p>
                        <p>Mr.DUNHAM. I want to bear testimony to the fact that the appropriation
                            was passed. I voted for it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The gentleman, I think, states the fact correctly. The
                            appropriation has been made. I suppose that there ought to be a
                            re-enrollmant of the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. I think it will be found that it is contained in the
                            Specific bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB, The amendment was offered by myself, in writing, and sent to
                            the Clerk at the time the Specific bill was being read. I offered it as
                            an amended section, and it was adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. When the question came before the Committee, we were
                            informed that the House had passed a bill making the appropriation, and
                            so it was left. But alter the Specific bill came back from the Senate,
                            the gentleman from Marion made the motion and it was put in.</p>
                        <pb n="271" xml:id="VAA8558-08-271"/>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER. I move that the Clerk be instructed to correct the bill, if
                            the bill has not been signed and returned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. HENRICKS. The bill has been signed and returned.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I suppose the motion of the gentleman from Monroe to have a
                            re-enrollment of the bill - is the proper course to pursue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. I would suggest to the Chair, that the motion I made be
                            informally passed over, for a communication from the Governor.</p>
                        <p>A message was now received from the Acting Governor, asking for the
                            withdrawal of the message of this day, communicating his approval and
                            signature of the bill of the House, numbered <ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_187">187</ref>, and other bills - a mistake
                            having occurred in said message.</p>
                        <p>By unanimous consent, the message was ordered to be returned
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Mr. BUSKIRK, (by unanimous consent,) the House took up the
                            Gettysburg bill, [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_187">H. R. No. 187</ref>,]
                            and it was ordered to be re-enrolled including the Section appropriating
                            $3,467 83, to pay the balance of the amouut assessed against the State
                            of Indiana, on account of the Gettysburg National Cemetery.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. If there is nothing before the House I would like to make a
                            report from the <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The House is on a division upon the motion of the gentleman

                                        act, approved March 2,1865, to discourage the keeping of

                                        March 11, 1861, and providing that nothing in this act shall
                                        be so construed as to conflict with an act entitled an act

                                        being unable to concur with the recommendation of the

                                        table, desire to to submit the following minority
                                        report:</p>
                                    <p>The minority of your committee are satisfied that under the
                                        act of March 2, 1865, none but useless and sheep-killing
                                        dogs can be taxed, although a different constimction has
                                        been placed on the said act. The minority of your committee
                                        cannot perceive upon what principle the owners of good dogs
                                        can be taxed, because some other person may own useless and
                                        sheep-killing dogs. The tax, though small, is not regarded
                                        by many of our best farmers with favor and many persons
                                        engaged in sheep raising assert that if the dogs, and
                                        especially the hounds, are killed off, the foxes will kill
                                        more sheep than the dogs. The minority of your committee
                                        concede that useless and sheep-killing dogs should be killed
                                        without any liability against the person killing them, and
                                        that the owners of such dogs should be held liable for all
                                        damages done by such dogs. The minority of your committee
                                        believe that hounds should be preserved to protect sheep,
                                        pigs and poultry from foxes and other animals; that when
                                        thieves and robbers are committing their depredations all
                                        over the State, that the faithful watch dog should not be
                                        taxed or killed off; that when every house and barn in the
                                        State are infested with rats, that the rat-terriers should
                                        not be taxed or killed. The minority of your committee
                                        believe that this act should be repealed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire of the gentleman from Monroe,
                            whether the principle of his report applies to the Old Dog Tray?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. He has been dead for a long time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL. It is the most Dogmatical report I ever heard.</p>
                        <p>Mr. KILGORE. I am opposed to repealing the Dog Law, for it was upon its
                            merits that we carried the State. [Laughter.]</p>
                        <p>The reports lie upon the table under the rule, and they were ordered to

                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. Mr. Speaker, I desire to withdraw my objection to the
                            report which the gentleman from Jennings wishes to make from the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>. I understand that

                            Davis on a Sour Apple Tree.</p>
                        <p>There being no objection - </p>
                        <p>Mr. PRATHER reported from the <orgName>Committee on Federal
                                Relations</orgName>, to which was referred two memorials numerously
                            signed by citizens of the State of Indiana, and the memorial of Loyal
                            Young Men of the town of Vernon, in Jennings county, protesting against
                            the pardon of Jefferson Davis; also the concurrent resolution on the
                            same subject introduced by Mr. Groves, That said Committee having had
                            the said memorials and resolution under consideration, a majority of
                            them report, That ths late rebellion in the interests of Slavery has
                            already been pronounced by the civilized world to be a crime against
                            humanity, and the criminality of that attempt to over throw this
                            Government is only excelled by the brutality with which it was
                            prosecuted. The rebellion has been overthrown, and the power and
                            authority of the Government of the United States has been re-instated
                            and established, and it only remains to be decided whether its authors,
                            the individuals guilty of those political excentricities - the blackest
                            crimes that ever disgraced civilization - shall go unwhipt of justice.
                            The interests of free government demand that the authors of so great a
                            crime slaall not escape. The Constitution of the United States defines
                            treason to be the act of levying war against the United States, and can
                            any man doubt that Jettersen Davis and his associates did levy war
                            against the United States? Then the propriety of their trial for treason
                            is unquestionable, unless we subscribe to the tlocirine, That one murder
                            makes the felon whilst a thousand makes the hero. - The report reasons
                            at some length in this strain, to the conclusion, That the trial of
                            these men is a moral and political necessity; and that when the penalty
                            of the law shall fall on the guilty, then, and then only, will the law
                            be vindicated. Whereupon, a majority of tho Committee return to the
                            House without amendment, and respectfully recommend the adoption of the
                            following concurrent resolution, submitted by Mr. Groves on the 15th day
                            of November, 1865:</p>

                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. All I ask is the yeas and nays on the adoption of the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I offer the following additional resolution:</p>
                        <floatingText>
                            <body>

                                    <p>And be it further Resolved, That the said Jefferson Davis,
                                        who is hereby declared guilty, shall be hanged upon a

                                        "The Constitution of the United Statesa league with
                                        Hell, and a covenant with Death;" to which Wendall

                                    <p>Resolved further, That Salmon P. Chase, Henry Ward Beecher
                                        and Beast Butler are hereby appointed hangmen.</p>

                        <p>Mr. PRATHER. I move to amend further by adding:</p>
                        <p>"And that the gentleman from Huntington be Chief Mourner."</p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. Mr. Speaker, the paper by the gentleman from Huntington was
                            read for information.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair understands it so.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NBWCOMB. Then I object.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I am a member of the <orgName>Committee on Federal
                                Relations</orgName>, and have a right to offer it as a minority
                            report, since it is not competent for me to offer it as an
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. Certainly. We are acting under a division of the House, and
                            nothing can be done under this order, but to receive the report from the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations</orgName>. The pending
                            question is on the application of the gentleman from Huntington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Mr. Speaker, I have a proposition to make.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER answered with the hammer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COFFROTH. I submit it, then, in behalf of the minority of the
                                <orgName>Committee on Federal Relations.</orgName></p>
                        <p>Mr. NEWCOMB. I made the objection, not out of mere courteous retaliation,
                            but, because I never indorsed the doctrine of Garrison. I do not want it
                            to go on the journal.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. It comes in as a minority report.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. I propose to amend the resolution reported back and
                            recommended by the majority of the Committee, by inserting after the
                            word "Davis," these :"Horace Greely, Wm. Lloyd Garrison,
                            Weudall Phillips, Salmon P. Chase, Beast Butler, Gerrett Smith, Union
                            Slide Banks. Priest Cheever and George W, Julian."</p>
                        <p>Mr. OLLEMAN. Believing that we have not time to give to this subject the
                            deliberation which its importance demands, I move to lay it on the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. There is a division of the House pending, and a special
                            order to hear this report. The Chair cannot entertain the motion.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, (by unanimous consent.) submitted a resolution of thanks to
                            David W. Krutts, Reading Clerk, for the ability, efficiency and fidelity
                            with which he he discharged the duties of his position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Is that the man that read with pudding in his mouth? I move
                            to add these: "Cyrus T. Nixon, Principal <pb n="273" xml:id="VAA8558-08-273"/> Clerk. Robert O. Dormer, Assistant Clerk,
                            and" - </p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks that the language of the gentleman from
                            Floyd is not decorous towards an officer of the House.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Then I will say the man that reads in so rapid and confused a
                            manner that no member of the House can understand him. I desire to say
                            that I meant nothing disrespectful to the Clerk, by the remark which the
                            Chair notices. It was intended as a jest: and I hope that the remark of
                            the Chair will not put it as an earnest reflection upon that
                            officer.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair begs pardon, - but the remark was repeated on the
                            floor.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK accepted the modification : so that the resolution, as it was
                            adopted, read as follows:</p>

                        <p>Mr. FOULKE, from a minority of the Select Committee on Mr. Buskirk's
                            Agricultural College bill, [H. R. No. 6,] reported that the undersigned
                            do not concur in the report of the Chairman of said committee, in so far
                            as it located said College at Bloomington. Signed, D. C. Branham, W. W.

                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The question of location was not in the majority report.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair has not attempted to indicate to any committee
                            what was submitted to them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK. The matter was under stood by the Chair when the gentleman
                            from Monroe was put upon the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair did not intend to qualify at all on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD. The House did not understand that this Select Committee had any
                            power over the subject of location.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. The Chair does not decide anything upon that subject. Until
                            this report came in, the Chair did not know that the majority had not
                            reported on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The report lies on the table.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BURWELL asked for unanimous consent to introduce a resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER objected.</p>

                        <p>Mr. OSBORN. Mr. Speaker, I move that this House do now adjourn <hi rend="i">sine die</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The SPEAKER. <hi rend="i">Gentlemen of the Home of Representatives:</hi>
                            The effect of the concurrent resolution just agreed upon, is to end the
                            present session of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Before announcing the result it is proper I should ask your indulgence
                            while I repeat my thanks for your kind, considerate and uniform support
                            in presiding over your deliberations.</p>
                        <p>What has been done - and it is much - is now committed to the
                            consideration of those we represent, and with an honest confidence it
                            will be approved.</p>
                        <p>In seperating for the last time from this place of public service we
                            shall bear away much respect and affection for each other, formed here;
                            and I say it myself, that while many will be remembered in love, there
                            will beand there is no mental reservation in this - malice for none.</p>
                        <p>I commend you all to the welcome and embraces of your homes and friends
                            and families.</p>
                        <p>And so the House of Representatives of the XLIVth General Assembly of the
                            State of Indiana, in the close of the second session thereof,
                            adjourned.</p>

                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM called up the Special Order, viz: the consideration of the
                            Joint Committee's State Debt Sinking Fund bill [<ref target="#HB_1865_11_13_285">H. R.No. 285,</ref>] the question being
                            on the third reading.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE gave reasons why he should oppose the bill. He avoided the
                            political questions affecting the case, except that he felt it due to
                            himself and his constituents to state, that they'were infavor of
                            subjecting United States Boards to taxation. All laws for exemptions
                            from taxation were cumulative and unjust. It was right that property
                            held by the sovereign should not be taxed, but beyond that the burdens
                            of taxation should rest equally upon all. Property and people should pay
                            taxes without discriminations. But since Chief Justice Marshall and the
                            Supreme Court of the United States has decided adversely, for exemption
                            of United States Bonds, it became a public duty to abide by that
                            decision. He held, however, that Congress has the power to subject these
                            bonds of the United States to taxation. Congress might legislate even to
                            the extent of impairing contracts and vested rights. The only question
                            was, as to the right and equity of the proposition, The principle was
                            well settled, that each Congress was sovereign in this regard -
                            unrestricted by the acts of any other Congress. Almost every Congress
                            was passing laws repealing and otherwise affecting and modfying former
                            acts of Congress. - But his purpose was not to discuss this whole
                            question. He desired here simply to define his and his people's
                            position on this question. The first question was, whether these debts
                            are due. It was conceded that they are not. It was alleged that the
                            State is pledged to a levy of twenty five cents on the hundred dollars,
                            and a seventy five cents poll tax, till the old debt shall be paid,
                            principal and interest. But this was an error. This obligation had not
                            rested on the people of the State since the first day of January, 1853:
                            to which point he read the statutes of 1846 and 1847. And he showed that
                            the clauses of the act relied on by the Governor when he alleged that
                            the faith of the State was pledged for this tax respected only the
                            payment of two per cent, on the principal from the first of January,
                            1847, to the first of January, 1853. Thus he settled this matter of the
                            State's plighted faith for the payment of the old debt. - The next
                            question was, since there is no plighted faith in this direction, Is it
                            expedient to tax for these debts now? He thought not, especially because
                            of the disproportion that had now to be paid by the farming interests of
                            the State. Taxation was always heavy enough on this largest class of the
                            people. What Should our farmers be compelled to pay three per cent, tax
                            for the right of living in the State? Was this the protection which the
                            Legislature owes the people? Neither our honor required it, nor was it
                            defensible on the ground of expediency. The chief matter to look to here
                            was this: That the bonds be paid at maturity, principal and interest, as
                            their face requires; and that the burdens of taxation rest equally upon
                            all. Heavy taxation would reduce the ability of the people to pay, and
                            discourage emigation. - As to the charge of repudiation, he regarded the
                            bill itself as tending to repudiation. It did not propose to pay the old
                            interest - interest on bonds of which we have not paid a cent for twenty
                            five years - For these and other reasons he was opposed to the bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. The gist of the opposition to the bill was this: The
                            allegation that there are held in the State an hundred thousand dollars
                            worth of United States bonds and securities which are not taxed.
                            Admitting this, and that all these are not taxable, was this a
                            sufficient reason that we should not tax for the State debt? The
                            gentleman from Cass [Mr. Lasselle] has asserted, that Congress could
                            legislate in contravention of rights. He controverted the doctrine.
                            There were vested rigts here which no legislation could impair.</p>
                        <p>Mr. LASSELLE. Had not Congress powder to pass any law it pleases?</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. The rights of the holders of these bonds having vested, they
                            can not be divested.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. Had not Congrees <pb n="276" xml:id="VAA8558-08-276"/> always
                            exercised the power to pass laws impairing contracts?</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS. Congress had claimed the power to pass a bankrupt law. But it
                            had been conceded on this floor that Congress had not the power to
                            divest the rights in question here. With reference to the pending bill,
                            he said: Legally speaking, it might be true that these deb s were not
                            due, and would not be but at the pleasure of the State: but these debts
                            might as well be due, for sooner or later taxation would have to pay
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. Why not, before maturity, take up the State's bonds at
                            their market value? Was not that the practice of other States?</p>
                        <p>Mr. RHOADS admitted it, and he was sorry to say it; because, such a thing
                            was not creditable either in States or individuals. He was in favor of
                            the bill, because it would pay the Stat 's debts. It was not
                            necessary to show that the issuance of these government bonds was a
                            necessary act; and that they had saved money to the government and
                            materially aided in the support and confirmation of our free
                            institutions. It was admitted that these boncis were not taxable; but he
                            could not take this for a reason that we should not pay the public debts
                            according to our ability. And he shswed by figures the ability of the
                            people to pay the tax proposed in the bill, which will pay the State
                            bonds, and save millions that would otherwise be paid in interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. DUNHAM. This bill provides for the war loan bonds first. He
                            understood that a large portion of those bonds were sold in the first
                            place at a discount. He desired the gentleman from Jefferson [Mr.
                            Branham] to state whether this was not the font.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM stated some of the considerations that governed the
                            Committee. The bill was the mind of the Committee. Debate foere had not
                            looked into this question properly. What was our duty? and what our
                            interest? These go together. The history of this debt would convince any
                            gentleman than it was our duty to provide now for principal and
                            interest. If we did not make such an agreement it is not in the power of
                            language to express an agreement. He said every dollar of tbis principal
                            and interest was due and payable whenever the State should be able to
                            pay after twenty years. Now what was to our interest in this question?
                            He contended that it was especially to our interest to pay this debt
                            now. It was policy not to contract debts in flush times, but to pay
                            them, The complaint of gentlemen about exemptionsfrom taxation was for
                            ulterior objects. The people of Indiana were never more prosperous -
                            more free from debt - than they are now, and they never held more money
                            in their hands than they have at the present time, Now, then, was the
                            time to pay debts. One provision of the bill was to levy fifteen cents,
                            another bill levied ten cents, and the school levy, sixteen cents, make
                            forty-one cents, instead of eighty-one cents, as for the past year. The
                            State of Ohio levied seventy-five cents to save her credit. One of the
                            elements of prosperity was to use money so as to make it produetive of
                            the most advantageous results. As to the Sinking Fund, while the law
                            shows you shall have seven per cent., the figures show the receipt of
                            less than five per cent, on the amount. The reason was, that so much of
                            the money was idle, unemployed. He rejoiced that all these theories of
                            sinking funds were about to be exploded; and that debtor and creditor
                            were hereafter to be brought as near together as possible. The best
                            custodian of the public money was the people themselves. He showed that
                            expenses attendant on the loaning of this Sinking Fund made it cost,
                            instead of seven per cent, about nine per cent, to the borrower. The
                            effect of this financial policy was to keep away from us the intelligent
                            investment of capital.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to the diversion of the State debt levy in 1861. It was
                            not possible for mortal man to contemplate the damage that would result
                            from a breach of the plisfhted faith of the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. Why had the gentleman changed his position since he introduced
                            his bill No. 191 of last session?</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. That bill contemplated the adjustment of the entire amount
                            of the State debt. He showed that in the close of the Buchanan
                            Administration the government bonds were sold at a discount of one per
                            cent a mouth. It was a part of the destructive policy of the rebellion
                            to destroy the physical, the financial energies of the government: and
                            it became absolutely necessary for Indiana, in 1861, to step into the
                            breach - to come up with all her resources to the support of the
                            government. He then referred to the old loan of the school fund for the
                            ordinary expenses of the State till - it amounted to $700,000, - and
                            legislation in that connection. The ordinary expenses of the State had
                            reached now about $700,000 annuallybesides extraordinary expenses. The
                            State's bondholders really vrould have had no right to complain if
                            we had not paid them one dollar of interest since 1861, when we were
                            called upon to make heavy extraordinary .appropriations on account of
                            self preservation. Self preservation was the first law of nature. By
                            this bill, as fast as you puy off any part of the debt it goes out of
                            existence. By it we shall pay $500,000 of the principal the first year,
                            and pay off the entire indebtedness of the State in about ten years; and
                            if the $2,000,000 of the Sinking Fund were to be made available, the
                            entire debt would be paid in six years Why not wipe it out then - pursue
                            a <pb n="277" xml:id="VAA8558-08-277"/>that will invite emigration and
                            the investment of capital amongst us. He deprecated repudiation, - would
                            not exchange the State's honor for political capital. He replied to
                            Mr. Brown's objection to the 4th section of the bill in relation to
                            a discrepancy between the certificates of the State's Auditor and
                            his pro rata share. If a man wants to cut up his certificate he comes
                            with the original to the State's officers. If that gentleman would
                            introduce a bill to obviate his objection, he would vote for it. The
                            simplest way for the accomplishment of the object was that proposed in
                            this bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN submitted his proposition to buy up the bonds at a
                            discount.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BRANHAM. It would damage the credit of the State far more than what
                            might be gained in that way. If we could but accomplish the object ef
                            this bill he would be satisfied. It was a matter of profound solicitude
                            with him. And with regard to the course pursued by the opposition to the
                            bill here, he suggested that the position of gentlemen in this great
                            struggle against the rebellion, made all their investments for political
                            capital against this bill of a rather doubtful character.When he had
                            concluded, he demanded - see p. 187.</p>

                        <p>Pending the consideration of the substitute for Mr, Buskirk's
                            Agricultural College bill [H. R. No. 0] reported by the majority of the
                            Select Committee thereon, accepting the donation tendered by the people
                            of Monroe county of the Geological and Mineralogical Cabinet of the late
                            Dr. Owen, and the "Dunn Farm" near Bloomington, and making the
                            Agricultural College a Department of the Indiana University: - </p>
                        <p>And Mr. Milroy's report from a minority of said Committee for the
                            acceptance of the Lands, buildings, &amp;c.. of the Stockwell School,
                            and $10,000 proposed to be donated for the location of said College at
                            Stockwell, by the people of the county of Tippecanoe: - </p>
                        <p>And Mr. Sim's motion to amend the amendment by striking out and
                            inserting acceptance of the proposed donation ufi $100,000 for the
                            location of said College at Richmond, in Wayne county: - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said: This subject had attracted general attention. It had
                            been investigated by two committees at the last session, and a select
                            committee at this session. The latter committee had reported for its
                            location at Bloomington in connection with the State University. He
                            supposed that the consideration which influenced the committee in the
                            location was its connection with the Indiana University, with which was
                            connected an interest worth $200,000 belonging to the State. He referred
                            to the proposed donations of the geological and mineralogical cabinet of
                            the late Dr. David Dale Owen, worth $75,000, but which the heirs were
                            willing to sell to the State for $25,000: and that of the farm - the
                            Dunn farm, laying right alongside of Bloomington - worth $25,000; making
                            a total money inducement of full $300,000. He reasoned to show that the
                            College would be strengthened by its connection with the Indiana
                            University; and he was in favor of making the location now. There were
                            only eighteen months remaining of the five years limitation in which
                            time this College must be in operation. Locate now, and transfer the
                            land serip to the Trustees, and let them hold till it will command a
                            more desirable price, that will be sufficient to permanently endow an
                            Institution that shall be a perpetual credit and boast and ornament of
                            the State. Located elsewhere, not in connection with the State
                            University and the Monroe donations, and it would require large
                            appropriations from the Treasury to set it up and keep it in working
                            order till the Congressional endowment could be realised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, submitted that Mr, Sim's amendment was in
                            the 2nd degree - the minority report being an amendment to the
                            amendment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MILLER spoke to the question of location, and the importance of a
                            judicious and wise location. His opinion was decidedly favorable to
                            Tippecanoe county. He supposed that the proposition from the
                            Battleground was withdrawn, but whether at the Battleground or at
                            Stockwell, the Tippecanoe donation would be forthcoming in good faith
                            not in mineralogical Cabinets at fictitious prices. Bloomington could no
                            sooner buy that Cabinet than the people of Tippecanoe county, that was
                            brought up here for effect: and that is the reason why Agricultural
                            Colleges fail none of them have had this Owen Cabinet! Then they have
                            Professors in Bloomington! The Indiana University had been established
                            since 1822, and in all that time they had established no Chair of
                            Agriculture. None of its professors knew how to run a plow, nor they
                            ever would. Then the Bloomington University had scarcely more students
                            than they had at Slockwell, or even at the Battleground; whilst tuition
                            was free at Bloomington, and students had to pay at Stockwell and at the
                            Battleground: and this was evidence to his mind that Bloomington was not
                            an eligible and acceptable location. There were the same facilities of
                            Teachers and Buildings at Stockwell as at Bloomington. He wanted a
                            division of the question - the last question, would be on striking out
                            Bloomington.</p>
                        <pb n="278" xml:id="VAA8558-08-278"/>
                        <p>Mr. SIM said there were many eligible sites for this college. He spoke of
                            a little school at Richmond having about as many students as there were
                            at Bloomington, Battleground and Stockwell all put together; and the
                            people of Wayne county would donate $100,000 in money toward the
                            location in that county.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GREGORY, of Warren, gave the reasons for his preference of the
                            location of the Agricultural College at the Battleground. It was not the
                            object of Congress that this College should be tacked upon any other
                            institution. The University at Bloomington had not prospered as other
                            schools in the State that bad been founded without the aid and fostering
                            of the State., He was in favor of Richmond before Bloomington, as a
                            location for eligibility. But the Battleground was the only Historical
                            Battleground in the State - and he hoped there never would be another -
                            but it was a proud memory, and would be worthily perpetuated by the
                            location there of this great State Institution. He predicted that, if
                            this College were located at Bloomington it would be about the last we
                            would hear of the State Agricultural College: for it would be merged
                            into the Indina University.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSWELL was on the Special Committee. There were other points in the
                            State which he might have preferred so far as location is concerned, as
                            the Battleground or Stockwell. But he came to prefer Bloomington for the
                            location, because it was the place of the Indiana University, which it
                            was the duty of the State to foster. We were behind other Slates in
                            State institutions of learning. We could not compete with the far
                            younger State of Michigan in this regard. He referred to the
                            expensiveness of building, which would be incurred immediately ifthe
                            location were fixed at any other point than Bloomington. He considered
                            the comparative advantages of all the proposed locations, and gave his
                            decision for Bloomington - leaving wholly out of consideration that
                            invaluable Owen Cabinet. - and replied to objections. He scouted the
                            comparison that had been instituted between these high schools of
                            Tippecanoe and Wayue and the Indiana University.</p>
                        <p>Mr. COX urged nothing against other locations: but Wayne countty was the
                            foremost agricultural county in the State. It was also a county of
                            enterprising mechanics. The farmers of Wayne county had proposed a
                            donation of $100,000, by which a college could be built up right from
                            the foundation. He submitted that this wouln be far wiser and better
                            than to undertake to patch up old buildings. He thought a little hard of
                            the slight which Wayne county suffered last winter, in the fact that the
                            Select Committees on location did not visit that locality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT (Mr. Hamrick in the Chair) thought it best to postpone the
                            consideration of this bill till to-morrow, when we might have it
                            printed. He spoke of the object of this grant to advance the great
                            interests of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. And he thought the
                            attachment of the institution to the State University was hardly
                            compatible with the grant. He referred to the munificence of this grant
                            of 306,000 acres of landnot land but land scrip that will locate lands.
                            He read the towns of the grant. This presented his first objection to
                            the bill, which was to the provision that tine State should not sell the
                            scrip, but should put it into the hands of the Trustees. He thought such
                            a transfer by the State impossible under the Act of Congress. He
                            referred to the act of last session creating the Trustees of the Indiana
                            Agricultural College. The bill was merely a modification of the charter
                            of the State University. But it provides that the University Board of
                            Trustees shall select the land.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK said, it was provided that the Board might appoint a
                            sub-committee of three.</p>
                        <p>Mr. PETTIT. Better; but still it was expensive - a traveling board of
                            officers at five dollars a day for the period of their employment. The
                            bill contemplates a large amount of freedom to be exercised by these
                            Trustees within the vaults of the State Treasury, if this benefaction
                            was not to achieve to result which the benefaction contemplates, we had
                            better turn our backs upon it. It was to give dignity and respectability
                            and influence to the farm and the sshop. It was to be a perpetual public
                            demonstration that the farm is the place of influence and honor. The
                            object of the governmet here was to stand by these agricultural and
                            mechanical institutions in the several States till tfhey shall be able
                            to walk. And we said when we took this, that we wonld holdl it as a
                            sacred endowment for a school for the advancement of the arts and the
                            largest and most honorable calling of man. But this bill was proposing
                            to marry this Agricultural College to the Indiana University, and put it
                            under the land of those whose pursuits have not informed them as to the
                            great interests of agriculture and the mechanic arts. For such reasons
                            he felt that this special ovder ought to be counted till we could get
                            the printed bill. He moved to print 200 copies of the substitute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BROWN. Sailing under a neutral flag, the gentleman had opened his
                            battery on Bloomington. He differed with the gentleman wherein he says
                            this institution should not be connected with the Indiana University.
                            The farmers of the older States were the best educated men in the
                            country, yet the gentleman intimates tthat students <pb n="279" xml:id="VAA8558-08-279"/> in agriculture do not want the elements of
                            Science and Literature. He stated the advantages of a connection of
                            these institutions. Mr. B replied also to Mr. Miller's objections
                            to Bloomington and pronounced a eulogy upon the old University, and its
                            faculty, teachers and alumni, and the people of that neighborhood, who
                            were his neighbors. The gentleman from Wabash [Mr. Pettit] was more
                            eloquent than he, but he yielded to no man in heart devotion to the
                            interests proposed to be advanced by the Indiana State Agricultural
                            College. He concurred with Mr. Pettit that this order should be
                            continued till to-morrow, and that we ought to come to our conclusions
                            with deliberations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BUSKIRK, without standing for the details of the bill, thought, the
                            first object should be location, and after that the bill could be
                            matured conformably to the location. His friend from Putnam [Mr. Lane]
                            suggested that the question of location be made the special order.</p>
                        <p>Mr. BOYD preferred that the question of location be decided first. He was
                            astonished to see men considering their own local interests in
                            connection with this location. There was a State institution at
                            Bloomington those charter required an agricultural college department,
                            We had now in this benefaction the means of the endowment of this
                            department of the University. He replied to objections to the
                            Bloomington location. As a member of this Select Committee he had given
                            his attention to this question of location; and he alleged that this
                            College could not be put into effective operation, anywhere else than at
                            Bloomington in the time which remains for this to be done, as one of the
                            conditions of the grant. Then we could go home to our constituents and
                            say to them with reference to this matter: "We have done the work
                            which you sent us to do."</p>
                        <p>The motion to postpone the further consideration of the bill till
                            to-morrow was then agreed to.</p>

                        <p>The House having under consideration the joint resolution [H. R. No. 1]
                            for epunging the XIIIth Article of the State Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. GRIFFITH said: <hi rend="i">Gentlemen of the House:</hi> - I do not
                            expect in the brief time I may occupy on this question, to present as
                            able arguments as those gentlemen who have preceded me or to interest
                            the House as they have done ; but duty to myself and those I represent,
                            appears to demand that I should claim your attention for a short
                            period.</p>
                        <p>I premise that I would do nothing looking towards negro equality in a
                            social sense.</p>
                        <p>I would not take away any prohibition now existing for the <hi rend="i">excess purpose</hi> of inviting negro immigration to the soil of
                            Indiana, for I am fully satisfied that it is to the best interests of
                            both races that the American and African should be separate and distinct
                            if it were possible; but I have come to the conclusion, after mature
                            consideration, that I will not be one of those who, in opposition to the
                            spirit of the Constitution of the United Stales, will proscribe any
                            person, of any nation or people, from settling upon or cultivating the
                            soil, or pursuing the ordinary avocations of life within the confines of
                            this State. I do not now commit myself to the proposition of negro
                            suffrage, for I do not know that it would be for the best interests of
                            either race. I ask nobody's favor or censure for the opinions I
                            hold upon this subject, nordo I care whether their utterance shall
                            render me popular or unpopular.</p>
                        <p>The mere politician acts and speaks for the present, and is very careful
                            of his popularity. The statesman, looking down calmly through the long
                            vista of the future and endeavoring to master the great questions
                            arising for his consideration, acts for what stems to him to be the
                            prosperity of all who may come after him, regardless ot what may be
                            thought of him by those who surround him. Throwing himself upon the
                            great tide of the future he deports himself only to the well being of
                            all human kind, trusting alone to the subsequent endorsement of all good
                            men, the voice of future history, and to the approbation of the God who
                            created him.</p>
                        <p>I believe as an abstract question the General Government has done a great
                            deal for the colored race; and upon the other hand, the colored man, the
                            negro, has been of great service to the Government in our recent unhappy
                            but successful struggle in behalf of the unity and stability of this
                            great land of ours; but as governments have the exclusive power and
                            authority to grant and accord political rights to those who are worthy
                            prefer that we move thoughtfully and properly on the question of negro
                            suffrage, that we may never have in the time to come anything to regret
                            from our action on that subject.</p>
                        <p>I have no desire to leave the friendly and social relations which I may
                            have and enjoy with the white race to heek after that of the colored
                            man. My <hi rend="i">taste</hi>, sir, decides always in favor of the
                            society of the white man and the white woman, even though I run counter
                            to any new doctrine of philosophy of the present hour. But admitting
                            that negro suffrage is not good political economy, I look upon this
                            thirteenth article of our constitution as an unjust and oppressive
                            provision, which should <pb n="280" xml:id="VAA8558-08-280"/> be wiped
                            out forever from the organic law of our State. Without being at all
                            inconsistent, I am in favor of the passage of this joint resolution, and
                            upon the great principles of justice, as deduced from those abi ding and
                            unfading landmarks, to-wit, the Sacred Scriptures and the Declaration of
                            Independence. I trust it may receive the approbation of this General
                            Assembly, and also that of the people of this great State.</p>
                        <p>I have not had time to digest this matter as I should, to appear before
                            you as its advocate, and to supply that deficiency, I will call the
                            attention of this House to some strong points made by the Hon. John B.
                            Howe in the Constitutional Convention.</p>
                        <p>I cannot put the matter properly before this body without reading to you
                            extracts from his able, lucid and convincing argument as reported in the
                            debates of the constitutional convention.</p>
                        <p>Here, Mr. Speaker, is the argument made by Mr. Howe, once a candidate for
                            the position of Supreme Judge, and a lawyer and reasoner of eminent
                            ability:</p>
                        <p>"I lay down these propositions: There are two distinct rights of
                            domicile - social and political, and there are two kinds of political
                            domicile; the first is that possessed by the citizens of a State with
                            all the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United States.</p>

                                rights of domicile in the States of New York and Massachusetts, and
                                may therefore become citizens of those States; and under the
                                Constitution of the United States cannot be debarred of the
                                privilege of entering into any other State in the Union, or of the
                                right of acquiring and holding property there.</item>

                                States for all purposes.</item>

                                protection, and in this sense every, citizen of a State is a citizen
                                of the United States.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Those are the fundamental principles which I lay down, and which I think
                            cannot be moved either by argument or authority.</p>
                        <p>First, there are two kinds of domicile; social and political. I believe
                            this admits of no dispute.</p>
                        <p>The civilians referred to only one kind of domicile in the time of the
                            Roman Empire, when the civil law attained its perfection, because all
                            were citizens without political rights; having merely rights of
                            domicile.</p>
                        <p>This principle was, that after a man has acquired one domicile he retains
                            it until he has acquired another.</p>
                        <p>But under our Constitutions there are political as well as social rights,
                            and there are social rights without political rights.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of course then, there must be two kinds of domicile, for
                            example: A man who immigrates to this State, and has not been here one
                            year, has a social domicile. When be first enters the State, as a
                            citizen of another State, or the United States, the State is bound to
                            protect him in his person, and in his right to hold property, and the
                            State must deal with the citizens of other States as with her own.</p>
                        <p>That is the nature of social domicile. But when the individual has
                            resided in the State a year, he acquires a political domicile, and the
                            political right of domicile always includes the social right of
                            domicile; although the social right may exist without the political
                            right.</p>
                        <p>I remark upon the next proposition that there are two kinds of
                            citizenship; there is a citizen of a State with all the rights and
                            privilegea of a citizen of the United States; and then, secondly, there
                            is the right of a citizen of a State, with qualified rights as a citizen
                            of the United States. In proof of this proposition, I refer to the
                            Constitution of the United States, which evidently refers to two classes
                            of citizens, citizens of the United States and citizens of each
                            State.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Article 2, section I</hi>, requires the President to be a
                            citizen of the United States or native born.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Article 1, section 3.</hi> requires every Senator to have
                            been a citizen of the United States for nine years.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Article 4, section 2</hi>, uses the term citizens of each
                            State.</p>
                        <p>These expressions are certainly not convertible.</p>
                        <p>Each term was used in a different sense from the other.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Section 2,article 4,</hi> uses the term citizens of each
                            State, and why?</p>
                        <p>The Constitution of the United States is an instrument of government, an
                            irrevocable delegation of power, und a solemn league between the
                            original States, binding on those States which have subsequently entered
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The original States had at the adoption of this league, and ever since,
                            the exclusive right of declaring who might become citizens within their
                            own boundaries, with <pb n="281" xml:id="VAA8558-08-281"/> one exception
                            - the right of naturalizing aliens - which was conferred on the General
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>There are two kinds of citizenship in the United States.</p>
                        <p>A citizen of a State, in a political sense, has the right of voting for
                            all the officers of that State.</p>
                        <p>Look at the practice existing in the States of New York and Massachusetts
                            as to negroes and mulattoes.</p>
                        <p>But they have not the political capacity of becoming citizens of the
                            United State's in a full and complete sense, or citizens of every
                            other State. To a qualified extent, and in a social capacity, they may
                            become citizens of the United States. To a qualified extent, and in a
                            social capacity, they may become citizens of every other State.</p>
                        <p>It is manifest then that there is, and must be, a distinction between
                            these species of citizenship.</p>
                        <p>I now pass to the third proposition in reference to tke section declaring
                            that cit izens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and
                            immunities of citizens, in the Several States, which is, that this
                            section is entitled to a liberal and not a strict construction.</p>
                        <p>My proposition is that it has reference to the right of <hi rend="i">social</hi> domicile and not political privileges.</p>
                        <p>In Sergeant's Constitutional law it is said that Judges Chase and
                            Duval. in a case decided in Maryland in 1797, held thai this section
                            meant that the citizens of all the States should have the peculiar
                            advantage ef acquiring and holding real as well as personal property in
                            each State, and that such property should be protected and secured in
                            like manner with the property of citizens of the State where it is
                            located, and that it secures and protects personal rights. Judge Chase
                            was a very able man. and this opinion is entitled to the greater weight
                            from being delivered so soon after the adoption of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Chief Justice Story says: 'It is obvious that if the citizens of
                            each State were to be deemed aliens to each other, they could not take
                            or hold real estate or other privileges except as other aliens. The
                            intention of this clause was to confer on them a general citizenship,
                            and to communicate all the privileges and immunities which the citizens
                            of the State would be entitled to under like circumstances.'</p>
                        <p>This section cannot refer to political rights. It manifestly does not
                            mean that a citizen of one State may exercise political rights in every
                            other State.' But within its scope, it is entitled to a liberal
                            construction, because it is a covenant designed for the protection of
                            social rights, all the great objects for which human society is
                            desirable, and is in opposition to the exercise of tyranny and arbitrary
                            power. Moreover by the principles of every system of judicature founded
                            on natural equity, the construction of every grant is most strong
                            against him who grants, and how much greater then when the grant
                            embraces social rights to the constituent part of members ot the same
                            confederacy, and is favorable to civilization and humanity.</p>
                        <p>The States have no right to put their own construesion on this clause.
                            All the writers on public law sustain this position."</p>
                        <p>Mr. Speaker, this argument from which I have quoted so liberally is a
                            two-edged sword, cutting both ways.It establishes the right which is
                            contravened by this thirteenth article of the Constitution, that of
                            social domicile, and sets at rest the fears of others, that it may be
                            construed as perpetuating and creating any political right to the
                            negro.</p>
                        <p>I think, sir, that these propositions are conclusively proven. I think it
                            is proven that the possession of social domicile does not carry with it
                            political domicile, unless afterwards given by the State to which the
                            party may emigrate. I think that a proper construction of that section
                            of the Constitution of the United States, referring to citizenship, is
                            hereby made clear, and settles the fact that there is one kind of
                            citizenship given by that instrument to colored men, and that is what is
                            termed social domicile.</p>
                        <p>And then, the conclusion evidently follows that the Constitution of
                            Indiana in prescribing that class from coming into the State is in
                            direct conflict with that of the United States guaranteeing right and
                            immunities in one State to citizens of other States.</p>
                        <p>We find among us a people who are unfortunate enough to be the
                            descendants of those who have been by piracy and cruelty, by rapine and
                            oppression, stolen from their own land and transplanted into ours. Shall
                            we continue that oppression, or shall we, upon the great principles of
                            right and humanity, protect them as we should all humanity, in the
                            rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Let us lift them
                            from the degradation under which they labor, as far as we possibly can
                            without doing anything detrimental to the interests of ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I cannot possibly see how the amendment of the Constitution in that
                            respect will work harm to any one. We have stricken from four millions
                            of people in the South, by the proclamation and the result of war, the
                            shackles of slavery. We have thus done one great act of justice one
                            which will redound as much to the glory and future fame of this great
                            country of ours as any other which we can do in the future. Shall we not
                            follow it up by giving to all men within the confines of our State,
                            those rights which are inherent to all men? Let us not stifle the
                            promptings of an enlarged humanity ; let us not trample in the dust the
                            privileges <pb n="282" xml:id="VAA8558-08-282"/> of any; but let us
                            reach the helping hand to every one degraded, and say "Come up
                            higher."</p>
                        <p>Place yourselves upon the pedestal of an enlightened manhood, and, though
                            you may be under disabilities, assume your natural rights, and until
                            future ages should find out the right, "act well your part, there
                            all the honor lies." Say to the man of every clime, protection of
                            person and property shall be given you, residence and home shall be
                            guaranteed to you, the worship of God according to the behests and
                            promptings of your own conscience shall be youre, the right of labor and
                            possession of property shall not be taken away from you, and that, by
                            the laws of Indiana, you may sit under the shadow of your own vine and
                            fig tree, and there shall be none to molest you or make you afraid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen, let us say to the civilized world that we of
                            Indiana subscribe with all our hearts and minds and strength to the fact
                            that God made of one blood all the nations that dwell upon the face of
                            the earth, and those glorious principles that all men are created free
                            and endowed with the inherent rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of
                            happiness.</p>
                        <p>Let me here modify my expressions on negro suffrage. Let me say, sir, to
                            that man who has stood by the old flag of the Union, who has given his
                            body to mutilation and harm in defense of the integrity and perpetuity
                            of the Government and her free institutions, <hi rend="i">no matter what

                            heritage of ours.</p>
                        <p>I remember, sir, in my youtfy a motto flying at the head of the columns
                            of the papers of our country. It was this:</p>

                        <p>Let us show to-day that enlightened, patriotic, progressive Indiana
                            pleads now, pleads ever, and with such unanimity and such energy, that

                            representatives upon this question, as shall awaken the joyful oclioes

                        <p>The bill [<ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_219">S. No. 219</ref>] defining who
                            shall! be a competent witness in any court in this State - all persons,
                            without distinction of colorbeing on the second reading: - </p>
                        <p>Mr. BENNETT said: MR. PRESIDENT - I do not intend to occupy the time of
                            the Senate with a lengthy discussion of this question. The whole
                            question of the rights of the colored man has been so fully discussed in
                            public assemblies, and by the press, that there is scarcely a citizen
                            but has made up his mind on the subject, and surely no Senator is in
                            doubt as to what course he shall pursue. But as I had the honor to
                            introduce a bill on this subject, I desire to place myself on the record
                            ia favor of the passage of this bill, and to give briefly my reasons for
                            so doing. In the first place I do not consider this a political, or at
                            least a party question. I know that it ought not to be. Neither do I
                            consider it simply a negro question. It rises in importance to the
                            dignity of a white man's question, and when stripped of all
                            prejudice it is purely a question of justice or judicial policy. As the
                            discussion of the question will doubtless involve the subject of tbe
                            negro's rights and negro equality. I desire to say that I have no
                            concealments to make on any question of politics or legislation, and am
                            ready to meet the terrible "nigger question" face to face. I
                            believe, sir, that Divine Providence has so ordained human affairs that
                            one race of people may be in many respects the superior of another race.
                            I believe that in intellectual faculties, in moral qualities, in
                            physical energy, and in all the elements that go to make up the man,
                            that noblest work of God, the white race, the noble Anglo-Saxon blood of
                            which we boast our origin, is the superior of the African, the Indian,
                            the Esquimaux, or the Sandwich Islander. God has implanted in the breast
                            of every white man a monitor which tells him of this great truth. Not an
                            Abolitionist in all New England but recognizes this fact. A negro cannot
                            be so elevated, or highly educated and refined, as to obtain the full
                            equality in several matters, in the family of any white man in all this
                            country. Yet all this is no justification to that people who would
                            deprive these inferior races of their God-given rights, or in any way
                            prevent them from attaining to the highest state of civilization and
                            humanity within their power.</p>
                        <p>While I would avoid the wild fanaticism on the one hand, I would rise
                            above an unwise prejudice on the other. There are two classes of rights
                            that a man may possess - natural rights, or those given by <pb n="283" xml:id="VAA8558-08-283"/> the Creator of all men, and conventional
                            rights, or those conferred by men upon grounds of policy. The first
                            class of rights every man should possess in their fullest extent, and as
                            they were given him by the great law of God, no human statute should
                            deprive him of them. These great rights were re-enacted in that other
                            great instrument, second only to holy writ, in the memorable language
                            that "all men are created equal, and endowed with certain
                            inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
                            happiness." Hence any form of human slavery is wrong. Every man,
                            whatever may be his color, his parentage, or his station, is entitled to
                            the possession of his own body ; his bones, his muscles and his brains
                            are his; and he is secured in their rightful ownership by a title deed
                            which bears the broad seal of God Almighty himself, and he cannot
                            forfeit this right but by the commission of crime. And he who would
                            deprive any man, however humble, of this great boon, is a tyrant and an
                            infractor of the statutes of Heaven. Another natural right which every
                            man possesses, is the right to dwell wheresoever he pleases, and walk
                            the soil, and breathe the air of any country or state on the globe,
                            provided he conforms to the laws of the state or country. Any
                            legislative enactment which restrains any of God's creatures from
                            so residing, is in derogation of the law of God and natural justice.
                            Hence the foul injustice of the principle upon which is based our black
                            laws - that infamous enactment that says to the black man, you shall not
                            come to Indiana to live, because your skin is black and you are inferior
                            to us, although you may have lost an arm at Fort Wagner, or a leg at
                            Fort Fisher, in defense of the Republic, yet says to the rebel soldier
                            who fought to destroy the Government and whose traitorous bands are yet
                            dripping with the blood of our heroes slain, come and live with us, and
                            says to the cowardly skulker who escaped to Canada, to avoid his duty in
                            the hour of danger, come back, we welcome you home. I hope to be able,
                            before this session closes to record my vote for the abrogation of this
                            damnable provision, and thus wipe out the dark disgrace from the fair
                            fame of our noble State. Another one of those natural rights, is the
                            right that every man has to be educated; hence it should be our duty to
                            provide for the education of every human being in our State. I would do
                            all in my power to aid the negro in educating himself as high in the
                            scale of humanity as it is possible for him to do, even if in so doing,
                            he might over-take and pass an occasional white man. I would give him
                            the benefit of our Common School System, by establishing separate
                            schools for him, and allowing him his proportion of the funds. Natural
                            justice demands it, the voice of humanity demands it, the law of nature
                            requires it. Another of these natural rights is the right to acquire
                            property, and to have the same protected by the laws of the land; and to
                            that end, he should have the right to have his contracts frdity
                            enforced. Another of these natural rights is the right to have
                            protection for his life and limbs. Hence all enactments which prevent
                            him from going into our courts and enjoying fully their privileges, are
                            in violation of natural justice, and should, be repealed; hence the
                            necessity of the passage of this bill. Under our present law, a colored
                            man is deprived of all these natural rights. He cannot enforce his
                            contracts, because he cannot testify to them. A white man may impose on
                            him in a thousand ways and there is no redress; he cannot protect
                            himself in life or limb. A white man may commit on him the most
                            aggravated assaults and batteries; may destroy his property; may ravish
                            his wife or daughter, and if no other white man was present, he is
                            without a remedy, because he cannot prove it. I have known, and every
                            Senator here has, doubtless known of such instances. Then, sir, I place
                            it on other grounds - public justice requires the passage of this bill.
                            Without it the blackest crimes go unpunished, and many meritorious white
                            men go without a remedy. A white man may steal, rob, rape and murder,
                            and the victim may be a white person, yet if a thousand negroes saw it,
                            and no white person recognized the culprit, he can walk our streets with
                            impunity. You may wrong me in the worst possible manner, and if no one
                            was present but a negro, I have no remedy. Is it contended that negro
                            testimony is unreliable? If so, let the jury determine that fact. The
                            testimony of a man convicted of felony is, doubtless, unreliable ; yet,
                            we allow the testimony of thieves, murderers, and even perjurers We are
                            willing to let the jury determine the weight of their evidence. Why not
                            let the negro stand on his character before the jury ? Is there danger
                            of a white jury allowing too much credit to attach to the testimony of a
                            negro? We all know that the danger would be the other way. All such
                            arguments are utterly untenable, and I do not expect to hear them urged
                            on this floor. But it may be said that the admission of a negro to
                            testify, would tend to give him political, or social equality with the
                            white man. I regard all such fears as the emanation of a distempered or
                            prejudiced mind. Equality between whites and negroes cannot be so easily
                            effected. If the negro only needs a statute to render him my equal, I
                            say pass the statute at once. I cannot speak for others, but I believe
                            my superiority over a negro to stand upon a firmer basis. I believe that
                            I can concede to him all the rights that I enjoy, and yet be in no
                            danger of the dreaded equality that seems to <pb n="284" xml:id="VAA8558-08-284"/> haunt the minds of some people. If ever I
                            equalize with the negro, it will be because I chose to seek his level.
                            Sir, the negro has testified in most of the States, in all, I believe,
                            but this, and I have not heard that he is any nearer a white man than he
                            is here. Even in this State he testifies in the United States courts,
                            and I believe he is a negro still. But I may be told that in case he is
                            allowed to testify, he may then ask to vote and hold office. This does
                            not necessarily follow.</p>
                        <p>Voting is not a natural right, but is of the other class, or a
                            conventional right. If voting were a natural right, then women should
                            vote, and children too, for they have just as much natural right to vote
                            as men have. We cannot deprive women from testifying, except in cases
                            where they voluntarily render themselves incompetent, nor from holding
                            property, nor from residing where they please, for all these are natural
                            rights, but we can prevent them from voting, because that is a mere
                            conventional right. The negro has no right to demand that we shall
                            confer on him the right to vote or hold office. Some men say that he is
                            entitled to vote because he pays taxes, and argues that taxation and
                            representation should go together. If so, women and children should
                            vote, for many of them pay taxes, yet we do not consider it good policy
                            to allow them to vote. Again it is said that the negro soldier should
                            vote, yet I do not find anybody claiming that the white boy under twenty
                            one should vote, because he has been a soldier. It is true the negro
                            soldier is deserving the thanks of every true patriot in the land for
                            his services; yet he fought more for his own race and his own cause than
                            for us. He fought to break the shackles of millions of his race, and I
                            honor him for it, yet I do not become blind to all this, and work myself
                            into such an admiration for him that I give him credit for the entire
                            salvation of this country, and think he can only be paid by the right to
                            vote in every box he comes to. This kind of fanaticism is just unfounded
                            injustice, as is the prejudice that would deprive him of his natural
                            rights, I do not say I would oppose even negro suffrage, for I would not
                            consider them my equals if he did vote, nor do I think the country would
                            be greatly damaged, but I do say that there is no pressing necessity for
                            it, for it is not a God given right, and the negro can afford to wait,
                            the white man can afford to let him wait, and the country can prosper
                            without his vote. But in the case of negro testimony, I believe justice
                            to the negro, justice to the white man. and justice to the State,
                            requires this bill to become a law.</p>
                        <p>The further consideration of the subject was postponed and made the
                            special order for this day week.</p>

                        <p>The majority of the Special Committed on the subject of the State Debt
                            having reported in favor of the bill S. No. 279, and the minority of
                            said committee reporting in favor of the bill <ref target="#SB_1865_11_13_285">H. R. No. 285</ref>, - </p>
                        <p>Mr. VAWTER said: Mr PRESIDENT: - I propose to give very briefly the
                            reason that will govern the vote which I will give.</p>
                        <p>I shall vote against concurring in the report of the majority of the
                            Committee. The bill reported by them makes no provision whatever for the
                            payment of the debt. It simply provides for the postponement of the
                            payment thereof for twenty years. I can support no proposition which
                            dees not provide for the accumulation of a fund to discharge the
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>This debt was created about twenty-five years ago. It was compromised
                            about 20 years ago. It is now proposed - not to pay it, not to make any
                            provision for its payment within any reasonable time - but to postpone
                            it, adding one per cent, to the rate of interest to be paid.</p>
                        <p>It certainly is no part of wisdom to postpone it. It is not right. We
                            have had the money, we must repay it, and it strikes me that the sooner
                            we commence it the better we will discharge our obligations to the
                            bondholders and preserve our own credit.</p>
                        <p>Postponement of debt is as a general principle not sound financial
                            policy. I am not one of those who believe that a public debt is a public
                            blessing.</p>
                        <p>My theory always has been that a State ought to be free, and that no
                            State in debt is a free State in the true sense of the word. I believe
                            that no State ought to create a debt without at the time providing for
                            its payment.</p>
                        <p>The bill of the majority nowhere makes any provision whatever for the
                            payment of the bonds to be issued under its provisions. The bill
                            reported by the minority does, and therin it differs with the former,
                            and in that particular only is preferable.</p>
                        <p>Whether the State debt is due on the 19th day of January, 1866, can make
                            no difference with the proposition - that under the Butler bill it was
                            contemplated that the certificates of stock to be issued under that bill
                            should be paid at least by that time. The tax agreed to be levied by
                            that bill would ere this have discharged that debt, and Indiana to-day
                            would have another laurel added to the chaplet that already adorns her
                            brow.</p>
                        <p>We have our institutions of learning; we have our railroads, our fairs,
                            our newspapers, our schools and our churches; we have our Asylums for
                            the Blind, Deaf and Dumb and Insane. In war as in peace Indiana <pb n="285" xml:id="VAA8558-08-285"/> has a record of which she may be
                            proud. We have no stain upon our fair fame until we turn to our
                            financial policy.</p>
                        <p>The adjustment of 1864 to some extent wiped out the disgrace of not even
                            paying the interest on the debt. Twenty years have passed, and Indiana
                            is still in debt. The principal of the debt not paid. The bill of the
                            minority proposes to make arrangements for its early and speedy
                            settlement. The bill of the majority proposes to postpone it, makes no
                            provision whatever for its payment. The majority bill goes upon the
                            theory that Indiana is not able to pay the debt.</p>
                        <p>I do not concede the proposition, I believe the State is able to pay. I
                            think it comes in bad faith for Senators and Representatives, after
                            having for twenty years, permitted the solemnly plighted faith of the
                            State to be violated, now to pretend that our people are unable to pay
                            their debt.</p>
                        <p>I am in favor of no useless taxation, I am in favor of no wasteful
                            expenditure of the people's money. But I say to Senators that the
                            people I represent desire to see the good faith of Indiana preserved. I
                            love Indiana, I love her hills and her valleys; in her soil lie the
                            objects dearest to my heart: Indiana is my home - is the place of my
                            birth. To preserve her honor has ever been my most earnest desire. And
                            permit me to say to Senators, that I will never by any vote of mine,
                            acknowledge that Indiana is still unable to pay her debts, but requires
                            another extension of twenty years unless earnest is given by the
                            creation of a fund for paying it.</p>
                        <p>If our people have made a bad debt, let us pay it and be done with it. If
                            our people, by the arrangement of 1846, saved millions of dollars, let
                            us set about paying the debt left over against us by that arrangement.
                            Failing for twenty years to comply with our plighted faith, in not
                            levying the taxes provided for by our agreement, let us repair it, as
                            far as is in our power. How our hearts would throb, if we could feel and
                            know that Indiana was out of debt. Proud, indeed, will be the moment
                            when Indiana owes no debt, when not a single bond of Indiana is held by
                            any man outside of the State.</p>
                        <p>As that moment never will come until prior preparation is made; as that
                            moment never can come until we begin to pay the debt, as that moment
                            will never come un til we carry out the plighted faith of the State, by
                            levying the taxes necessary to pay it, I am in favor of inaugurating the
                            policy that will bring that proud moment soonest. The argument that our
                            people are already burdened with taxation, is a strong one. But, will
                            the bill proposed by the minority overburden the people? Already
                            two-thirds of the amount proposed to be levied by the minority is
                            levied. That bill, in effect, levies only 5 cents on $100.00 additional.
                            The 30 cents taken off by the repeal of the soldier's bill, even if
                            the minority bill is passed, will still leave the actual reduction on
                            the State taxes next year, 25 cents on each $100.00. Therefore the
                            minority bill will not increase the burdens of the people beyond what
                            they are now. Then with a positive assurance that our debt is to be paid
                            - with the certainty that this debt created, about twenty-five years
                            ago, is to be paid off - that there is to be no increase of the debt
                            beyond its present amount - I put the question to Senators - the plain
                            question - which do you prefer, the postponement of the debt, or its
                            gradual and ultimate extinction? If the former, the bill of the
                            majority, as it now stands, will meet your views. If the latter, then
                            the bill of the minority is the only one that provides any funds
                            whatever to promote that object. Economy, I think, is clearly in behalf
                            of the minority bill.</p>
                        <p>The Senator from Floyd, himself, demonstrates that his plan will cost
                            $11,000 more per year, more than even the present plan - which in the 20
                            years his bonds are to run, will make the sum of $220,000, more than 50
                            per cent. of the present indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>Let me state him correctly. The amount of interest at 1 per cent,
                            additional amounts per annum to $41,000. He estimates the expenses of
                            the Sinking Fund Commissioners at $20,000 per annum, State Agency at
                            $10,000, makiag total, $30,000. But as it costs 1 per cent. more for
                            interest than at present, we must pay $41,000 per annum, deduct $30,000
                            from the $41,000 and you will find that my first statement is
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>But, Mr. President, let us look a step further. Every year on the bonds
                            issued under the authority of the bill of the majority, the State will
                            be compelled to pay the sum of $246,000 per annum. This, inthe 20 years
                            which the bonds are to run on their face will amount to the sum of
                            $4,930,000being about the sum of 125per cent.Now it may not be improper
                            to contrast the cost of the bills a little more in detail. The majority
                            bill, will, as I have said, each year cost rtte people of Indiana the
                            sum of $246,000 per annum, interest. The minority bill, the first year
                            will cost the State, as interest, the sum of $205,000 the second year,
                            $169,625, the third year $153-750, the fourth year $128,125, the fifth
                            year, $102,500, the sixth year $66,687, and the seventh and last year,
                            the sum of $856,312. The amount paid as interest under the majority
                            report will be $1,782,000, deduct amount paid under minority bill,
                            $856,312, leaving over payment under majority bill of $875,688, or over
                            100 per <pb n="286" xml:id="VAA8558-08-286"/> cent. But as I have said,
                            the majority bill provides ne funds whatever for the payment of the
                            bonds under it, it is fair to presume that in the future, as in the
                            past, those bonds will run their full time. In the 20 years they have to
                            run, we will pay by the increase of the amount of interest the sum of
                            $820,000 more than we would be compelled to pay at the present rate of
                            interest - being about one-fifth of the entire amount of our debt. I
                            object to the bill of the majority, because its practical effect is to
                            increase the burdens of the people without any adequate cause. I deny
                            the basis upon which it proceeds - the inability of the State to
                            pay.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that the payment of $4,930,000 as interest in the 20
                            years which they have to run is necessary to enable the State to pay the
                            sum of $4,100,000 the amount of our debt being 5 per cent. due to
                            foreign bond-holders.The amount of interest to be paid under the Branham
                            bill before the debt is discharged will be $856,312; making a burden to
                            be discharged by the people of the State of Indiana, of $4,073,788, over
                            and above the amount; that will be paid under the Branham bill.</p>
                        <p>When Senators attempt to answer thes figures, and say that under the
                            Bradley bill, the debt will be discharged under 2 years - let them
                            please point to me on single provision in that bill which provide a fund
                            to discharge a single cent of those bonds to be issued under the
                            provisions of the Bradley bill. It will not do to say that we will pay
                            it under 20 years. The State said 20 years ago that she would pay her
                            debt in 1866. She has not done it - nor has she provided any means to do
                            so and now it is proposed not to pay, but to postpone it 20 years more.
                            Show me a single State that ever has discharged debt before it was
                            due.</p>

                        <p>Pending the consideration of the Negro School Bill, H. R. No. 208 - </p>
                        <p>Mr. WOOD said: MR. SPEAKER: The gentleman from Sullivan seems deeply
                            exercised at the condition of things. I should think from his language
                            that he would like to see Indiana a slave State. He looks on the 13th
                            Article as partially redeeming her character as a free State. I do not
                            follow the gentleman in all his windings, but I will endeavor to notice
                            the general features of his speech. He is, I see, in favor of more
                            effectually enforcing the 13th Article.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman from Floyd also tells us what he would do if the 13th
                            Article was stricken from the Constitution of our State. I know that
                            those who vote against the rights of the colored man attempt to justify
                            themselves behind the 13th Article, and therefore endeavor to impress us
                            with the idea that nothing should be done to alleviate the condition of
                            that portion of the population of our State. The men who oppose striking
                            out the 13th Article oppose this bill also. Humanity and Christianity
                            say strike out the 13th Article; give the black man the right to testify
                            in Court; let them be recognized as human beings, having the rights
                            which attaches to manhood. Sir, I feel proud to belong to that party
                            which has heard the cry of these people. We have endeavored to strike
                            out the 13th Article, to allow them to testify in Court, and now we
                            propose that the lights of knowledge be given them, and that they shall
                            have the privilege of sharing in the benefits conferred by the common
                            schools of the Slate, and why not ? I can see no good reason why this
                            bill should not pass. We profess to be a Christian people ; we should
                            feel ourselves very much insulted if any one should say we are not. Why
                            is it, sir, that we are willing in our legislation, in our daily
                            intercourse to be reminded of our duty as Christians and as citizens of
                            a Christian commonwealth, and to consider it our duty to be governed by
                            its precepts. Now, we think this all right, and whether we practice it
                            or not, the duty of taking Christianity for our guidance is acknowledged
                            and sustained, I am proud to say, by the popular voice; but there is no
                            rule without an exception. There is one topic, one question, in
                            considering which a party of men considerable in numbers, but thanks to
                            a righteous God and a patriotic people, no longer formidable in power,
                            that will insist in dealing with that question by ignoring the
                            principles of Christianity and the omnipotence of God; that question is
                            slavery, and the condition of the black man, whether free or slave. On
                            this they are atheists. But, sir, they occupy a position which proves
                            their inhumanity, and will prove their weakness and their condemnation.
                            They are the Canutes of this day. They say to the spirit of Liberty,
                            thus far shalt thou go, but no farther; but the tide keeps advancing,
                            washing down all obstructions raised by barbarous inhumanity, and kept
                            alive and nourished by the demon of slavery. Sir, these men have made
                            Indiana as near a slave State as they could. At the bidding of the slave
                            power they closed the door and shut up all avenue of escape to the
                            fugitive from slavery ; It was another link in the fetters of the slave.
                            To our shame be it said, men could be found in the face of God and in
                            the 19th century to refuse strike this infamy from the organic law the
                            State. Like a judgment from Heaven, <pb n="287" xml:id="VAA8558-08-287"/> it seems we cannot get rid of it; it will stick to us to shame us and
                            rebuke us for our complicity in a great crime against the laws of God,
                            and an oppressed and helpless people. No, sir, it seems we cannot get
                            rid of this 13th Article. And in what condition does it leave the negro?
                            I have done my duty, but I say to the opposition on this floor, you
                            refuse him the right to live on our soil; he cannot make a contract, he
                            cannot hire a house or a roof to cover him, he cannot buy a little spot
                            of ground, on which to earn bread for his family, he is without a
                            country, without a home; if he attempts to work, you inflict by the
                            laws, you defend fines on the white man who employs him, you refuse him
                            the rights of marriage, the marriage relation is declared void.* You
                            compel him to live in a state of concubinage and declare all his
                            offspring illegitimate; you refuse to allow him to testify in courts has
                            no protection for his property - an outlaw - himself an adulterer, his
                            wife a concubine, and his children bastard - he is as far as you can
                            make him a slave. You who sustain this iniquity are vainly bolstering up
                            the slave power and are part of it. Yes, sir, the slave code of Indiana
                            shames us and confronts us to-day, and while South Carolina and
                            Mississippi are modifying theirs, we find an opposition here determined
                            not only to retain it, but by open avowal approve it. The humanity of
                            the age and the public opinion of the State revolts at it. Christianity
                            condemns it and the voice of the people demand that this foul blot shall
                            be struck for ever from the escutcheon of our noble State, and shall no
                            longer mar the beauty and glory of her history.</p>
                        <p>We are the representatives of the people. On us the responsibility rests.
                            Shall justice be delayed any longer? Should we not rather say that
                            justice shall be done, and that we may, in a measure, requite some of
                            the wrongs that have been done them? say that they shall be educated:
                            and that they, bearing equally the burdens of the State, and the taxes
                            for the support of common schools, shall have schools established for
                            the education of their children, and then we shall have no longer in our
                            midst a people raised in ignorance, with no hope and no opportunity. And
                            why not? Why deny them? They have been faihful to us in peace, friends
                            in war; and loyal to us in our time of sorest trial and greatest need,
                            they have fought for us have fed our starving prisoners; have assisted
                            in their escape, and, tried to the last, piloted our men from rebel
                            prison pens, and out of those jaws of death and gates of health. Shall
                            we repay their loyalty with ingratitude? their fidelity with insult? No,
                            never!</p>
                        <p>And now I propose to examine some of the arguments adduced by the
                            gentleman from Sullivan when he says this is a Government for white men.
                            Sir, it is a Government for all men; we must take the world as we find
                            it; they are here, they are pirt of our people, we cannot get rid of
                            them. We adopted the 13th Article, thinking that would keep them out,
                            and they have increased steadily from, year to year. With this was
                            connected the scheme of colonization, and what has that accomplished? In
                            two years it has sent one man to Africa, at an expense of $1,600, and
                            this man ran away as soon as he got a chance and returned to this
                            country. The 13th Article for the purpose of keeping them out, cannot be
                            enforced to accomplish any results; the conscience of the State revolts
                            at it; humanity and Christianity forbid it, and God Almighty will never
                            let it be done. The Creator of us all made one man black and another man
                            white, and we have no right to question the propriety of His course. The
                            earth was given to man with the curse that he should eat his bread by
                            the sweat of his face; color did not exempt but applied equally to both.
                            Before God all men are equal, and in the foundation of our Government
                            this principle was fully recognized. The Governments of the old world
                            had been established on the princples of a monarchy and hereditary
                            aristocracy, and an imperfect representation of the people. This was the
                            condition of things there, when in the new world, a people highly
                            intelligent, aroused to a sense of danger to their liberties from the
                            encroachment of powers, and from the haughty and overbearing tyranny of
                            the mother country, started as one man, and new ideas of human rights
                            and of governments broke on the minds and took hold of the hearts of the
                            people of the Colonies, which culminated in the Declaration of
                            Independence, followed by the war of the Revolution. It was one of the
                            great milestones in the world's progress - an era in the
                            world's history - and seven years of trials, sufferings and war
                            secured them and us, independence and a government. The men of that day,
                            great and noble in the glories they had achieved, wise and liberal in
                            the government they had esblished, threw royalty and aristocracy away,
                            and established a government of the people, declaring that all men are
                            created equal, and have inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the
                            pursuit of happiness. This great idea, though often trampled under foot,
                            has, thank God, lived and sunk deep into the hearts of the American
                            people; and when we, the people of Indiana, met in convention to draft a
                            Constitution, the first thing done was to thank "Almighty <list type="simple">
                                <item><hi rend="sup">*</hi>See Seventh Indiana Reports - page
                                    389.</item>

                            and, to the end that justice be established, public order maintained and
                            liberty perpetuated, did ordain this Constitution" Then following
                            the preamble came the Bill of Rights, full of the spirit, and in the
                            exact words of the good old Declaration of '76. Judging from this
                            stand point, how stands the 13th Article? Sir, it is in conflict With
                            the spirit of the Declaration and our own Bill of Rights. It is an
                            inconsistency, a monstrosity, an unconstitutional thing, stuck into the
                            Constitution of our State, and from this has followed all the Black
                            Laws, and the justification for them.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman from Sullivan speaks of the Fathers of the Republic, and
                            endeavors to support his position by showing that slavery then existed.
                            I know it - but in the sense he will understand them, and as lie would
                            have us view them, it is unjust to their memory, and is not warranted by
                            the facts. In considering slavery and the condition of the slave, they
                            deplored it; he exults over their misfortune. They spoke of the slave
                            with sympathy and respect; he with heartless contempt. They wished some
                            plan adopted to get rid of it; he wishes its everlasting continuance. If
                            I am not right, why did Thomas Jefferson say: "Can the liberties of
                            a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis -
                            a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the
                            gift of God? that they are not to be violated out with His wrath.
                            Indeed, I tremble for my country, when I reflect that God is just; that
                            His justice cannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature, and
                            natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of
                            situation is among the probable events; and that it may become probable
                            by supernatural interference. The Almighty has no attribute which can
                            take sides with us in such a contest." Washington said that one of
                            his "first wishes was to see some plan adopted by which slavery
                            could be abolished by Iaw," and thus spoke all the great and good
                            men in the early days of the Republic. And when he brings these men up
                            as witnesses they condemn him. These men or posing us here to-day are
                            instigated by the spirit of slavery, carrying out and obeying the
                            behests of the slave power. If these colored men the right to life they
                            have the right to live here and the right by honest labor to sustain
                            that life here in this State, or anywhere else on earth. We build
                            churches and at these churches give money to send missionaries among
                            cannibals to teach them Christianity and impress on them the beauty of
                            Christian virtues. We teach that for them to live in concubinage is all
                            wrong, and insist that we must educate them, so that they may receive
                            and appreciate the lights of civilization and Christianity. If they knew
                            us here they would rebuke us, and tell us, we were a pretty set to teach
                            them, when in our midst, we had a people to whom we denied tbe right to
                            live on our soil, refused them protection to their own property,
                            declared their marriages void, themselves outlaws, their children
                            illegitimate, anr) every obstacle thrown in their way to preyent, them
                            from acquiring any education. What could we say? Sir, all these
                            oppositions are nothing more nor less than the spirit of slavery
                            speaking through their mediums here on this floor. They think they can
                            make political capital out of this; let them appeal to the people, they
                            will find they hare run their heads against a rock. Sir, I believe, if
                            instead of ratifying, as we did last winter, the Constitutional
                            Amendment abolishing slavery, the Constitution had been so amended as to
                            nationalize slavery, so that we could have had it here all around us,
                            they would shouted glory, hallelujah.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I would say petitions have poured in on us asking that the
                            colored population of our State shall have their rights, that they
                            should have the privileges of our common schools, being willing and
                            anxious to be taxed for that purpose, and if not done now, cannot long
                            be deferred, for all history shows that it is not good policy for a
                            State to have in their iniast an ignorant and illiterate people. Give
                            them knowledge; it will make them bettar men and more devoted to the
                            interests of the State.</p>
                        <p>For us to be great and prosperous, we must be just; and in the language
                            of the lamented Lincoln, it is a "way which, if followed, the world
                            will forever applaud and God will forever bless." </p>
