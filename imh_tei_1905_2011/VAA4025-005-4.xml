            <head>LETTERS FROM EIGHTEENTH CENTURY INDIANA MERCHANTS.</head>
            <byline>
                    <hi rend="i">BY CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN.</hi>
                </byline>
            <p>THE following papers are from the Lasselle Collection in the Indiana State
                    Library. They include the most interesting of the Early Indiana Miscellaneous
                    Papers, I–in fact, all of any interest that are easily decipherable.
                    They are given in chronological order.</p>
            <p>The earlier papers need no comment other than the word of explanation joined with
                    them.</p>
            <p>Between 1785 and 1795 there are more papers. They show the condition of trade
                    with some detail. These are the years when the English, after ceding all the
                    west south of the great lakes to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, still retained possession of the northern part of this territory.
                    Trade here was poor, and apparently becoming poorer. There was constant danger
                    of losing all the export trade of the region to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Indians, at times, were an uncertain quantity and at times
                    avowedly hostile. Many of the small merchants seem to have failed, and the large
                    companies had difficulty.</p>
            <p>It has seemed best, so far as possible, to give the original French where that
                    was the language used, and join the translation immediately with it. One letter,
                    that from John MacPherson to David Gray, in March, 1785, was printed in the June
                    number of the magazine, but is reproduced here for the sake of completeness.</p>
            <p>Miamie town was the precursor of the modern <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>; Ouiatenon was near the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>; the other names mentioned are, I believe, more familiar.</p>

                        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>I embrace this opportunity to enquire about your Health, and the
                                    nature of times in that Country, what appearance of Trade. its
                                    said that there is a good hunt to the Southward I hope you will
                                    find the good effects of it, by its being in reality so. we have
                                    had here a very mild open winter, by no means reckoned favorable
                                    for the hunt. Indeed the equipers has reasons to expect but very
                                    Indifferent returns from the differant posts here abouts, very
                                    dull times in the fort, no business of any kind, either with the
                                    French or Indians, the only payment that can be expected for
                                    Goods is flour &amp; corn this year, and I see no prospect
                                    of being able to dispose of it. the Contractors for the Mackina
                                    markett gets what corn &amp; flour they want for Goods out
                                    of their own Shops, so that there's Scarcely any paper
                                    currency circulating. Mr. McKillep told me that you was a little
                                    indisposed when he past the Miamies coming in. I hope you soon
                                    got over it; the Measles raged here this season by which many
                                    Children died. L. Williams died with that or a Sort of Scarlet

                        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                        <p>Yours of the 11th. Currt. I received yesterday, &amp; I
                                    assure you was glad to learn your safe arrival at the Ouias, but
                                    for god's sake dont pay a visit to the lads of the
                                    Vermilion as you did to those on this side of the Ouias, or you
                                    mayn't get so well off.</p>
                        <p>The Dog I have sent to Constant by his man &amp; I dare say
                                    he'll <pb n="147" id="VAA4025-005-4-011"/> use him well
                                    as I never saw a man have a greater desire of anything than he
                                    had for the Dog.</p>
                        <p>The Flour I have secured for him &amp; if any opportunity
                                    offers by water to the Ouias this fall I shall forward it, but
                                    there seems to be little appearance of any as the River here is
                                    frozen over. I'm afraid Mr. Mcintosh's goods
                                    &amp; those of the Company must winter here.</p>
                        <p>Tell Mr. Mcintosh I would have sent him down his men by land, but
                                    I thought it better to wait eight or ten days longer, in
                                    expectation of the Water's rising, if they dont they
                                    shall be sent by land along w. those of Mr. Vigo as it serves no
                                    purpose to keep them here, while they may be useful to him at

                                    all received and that you are now snugly settled at P. St.
                                    Vincents for the Season.</p>
                        <p>From the peaceable inclination of the Indians it is without a
                                    doubt that you can get safe up next Spring w[it]h your peltry
                                    -as it is intended to have a considerable Quantity of Goods at
                                    Miamis early next Sprmg- If any your eloquence with the French
                                    will prevent any of them from going to N. Orleans indeed I
                                    should think it not safe as in all probability the Spaniards
                                    will retaliate. I hope &amp; request you will inculcate the
                                    best notions in their minds in this respect, it being the prime
                                    object, likewise they should all forward their Peltry uncommonly
                                    early next Spring, in order to have their assortments in time.</p>

                                    Sharp does not mean to visit that Corner this Summer. Goods in

                                    here has been very unfavorable both for the work of the Village
                                    &amp; the Indians hunt, the snow has not been upon the

                        <p>In all appearance the Wabache will be scarcely passable this

                                    soon as you can, set off early from the Post or you will
                                    certainly run a great risque of losing your life Inclosed are

                        <p>The Grandmaster is the Bearer of this, who is sent by the Company
                                    to transact their affairs at your place. I dare say
                                    he'll have occasion to use all his eloquence in their
                                    cause to prevent them from going to <placeName>

                                    here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Leith tells me that if Lorimier goes to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                                    </placeName> the Major <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-005-4-015"/> will
                                    make him make restitution of the things he took of Joe, but
                                    I'm afraid he wont trust himself there.</p>
                        <p>I have searched all the house for Chorette's note of
                                    hand but cant find it pray if it is among your papers send it
                                    up. I mean to make an excursion his way as I hear he has got
                                    some property in his hands at present.</p>

                        <p>By people arrived here from the Poste I have the last accounts of
                                    you since hearing from yourself last January. They tell me you
                                    are in the <geogName>River St. Francois</geogName> in pursuit of
                                    Pierre. It is hard if, after so much pains you dont make
                                    something of him, &amp; Alexander gives me some hopes. All
                                    Im afraid of is from the Wabache Indians in your way up, for
                                    Gods sake make information at the Poste before you set off as in
                                    all appearance there will be trouble there this Summer.</p>
                        <p>Bertheaume has made Sixty Packs as Im informed &amp; will be
                                    here in a few days &amp; here I have 21. The trade here is
                                    entirely stopt at present, they wait the arrival of Sharp for
                                    Rum 28 kegs <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-005-4-016"/> of which were
                                    sent up all at the same time &amp; are now lodged in the
                                    Store so that little more can be made here this Spring.</p>
                        <p>The Delawares of the <geogName>White River</geogName> are all now
                                    settled at the Corns. Towns [?] &amp; the Shawnees are going
                                    to have lands here so that the trade of this place will greatly
                                    augment.</p>
                        <p>I have got little or nothing of Joe but as he takes in his
                                    Credits he gives us them &amp; asks for no goods.</p>
                        <p>The prices of Pelteries [peltries] is yet a Problem but Im afraid
                                    will not be much better than last year. The Company have not an
                                    ounce of Goods till they arrive from <placeName>
                                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                                    </placeName> &amp; you'll see a scarcity this
                                    Summer of Indian Goods that has not been experienced in this
                                    Country for a long time.</p>
                        <p>No body has nor will undertake the trading of Rum which occasions
                                    that the best &amp; better part of the Peltry will go to
                                    Rochedebout were it not for that we might yet make a few Packs
                                    here &amp; if Sharp arrives here soon he'll have a
                                        <hi rend="i">forte Affaire</hi> to keep the Store from being
                                    plundered if he wont sell it. They say that as the Grand Master
                                    of the Rum is not here they cant insist upon people selling what
                                    is not their own but as soon as he arrives they think he will
                                    set up Indian Tavern in which he will be waiter.</p>
                        <p>Carleton is now Viceroy of British America. The Canadians on his
                                    arrival mounted him on a Throne which they carried in Triumph to
                                    the Castle of Louis crying long live the benign Carleton the
                                    father of Canadians.</p>
                        <p>Lorimier is fled from the face of his Creditors &amp; gone to

                        <salute>My Dear Friend:</salute>
                        <p>We arrived at this place in better shape than Chapoton foretold,
                                    for with the forgetting of the paper which Cournoyer was to give
                                    to Constant I believe that it will not have cost us a roll of
                                    tobacco. I send you by Asselin 5 sacks. I would have sent you a
                                    pound of pepper, but there isn't any of it here at all.
                                    Perhaps Cournoyer will bring some of it. I will send you some
                                    [then].</p>
                        <p>Here follows the statement of the silverware which I have left to
                                    Mr. Chapoton. You will ask it of him.</p>
                        <list type="simple">
                           <item>150 490 640 large Pins</item>
                           <item>390 small pins</item>
                           <item>12 wrist bracelets</item>
                           <item>5 large double crosses</item>
                           <item>1 large single ditto.</item>
                           <item>6 medium double cross[es].</item>
                           <item>2 ear-rings</item>
                           <item>4 large pins</item>
                           <item>3 silver cores</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Added to which he has sent a [?] of oil to my wife. But I suspect
                                    that he has another and that he has sent it for himself to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, which means that you must demand an account from
                                    him and he must give you his note for what is lacking after the
                                    value of the [?] of oil which we have has been subtracted, if,
                                    of course, he does not give back the silverware itself.</p>
                        <p>You will have an account with Asselin for 120
                                    livres–from which you will deduct 50 livres which I
                                    have paid [?]. Out of the remainder get back your account and
                                    arrange the whole with him.</p>
                        <p>Blondiche and I wish good health to madame and the family, to the
                                    boy (is it then black there?) Sharp said all that was not spoken
                                    of but he laughed well at it). Compliments to our friends, your

                        <salute>Mr. Gamelin,</salute>
                        <salute>Sir:–</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter when a large part of your order had
                                    already been sent on. I sent you what we have here as far as the
                                    Ouia [Ouitenon] as the water is good. I send also orders to
                                    Peyette to send them on the first opportunity with the cloth and
                                    covers of Mr. Chapoton. If he does not get [an opportunity] to
                                    send them he will warn you. The rest of your merchandise, if
                                    there is nothing else, will be sent by Mr. Vigo as I start for <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to-morrow. I have sent a messenger [?] before my
                                    tobacco with orders to the men to give the preference to your
                                    packages. If they can take them all they will take them all, if
                                    not, I have given orders to Mr. Metter to send the remainder
                                    when the water is good. I hope that you have not refused the
                                    merchandise on the ground that it was not sent you on the first
                                    opportunity. The larger part of your order was not here, as you
                                    could know by asking Mr. St. Marie and Company and knowing well
                                    that these articles will be received within a few days after
                                    their departure I believe it better to send them all together.
                                    And if Mr. Bondy had waited as he promised me, you would have
                                    had them long ago. And all those who have started out from here
                                    to the post [<placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                                    </placeName>] can easily tell you if they wish how I have
                                    interested myself in your peltry.</p>
                        <p>So you will not reproach me, I hope, if the merchandise should
                                    not be there in time. I could not send them. But, after all, in
                                    any case that you can not, without injury to yourself, accept
                                    the goods, you have only to give them all to Mr. Robert Makay
                                    and the rest of the order will in every case be sent either to
                                    you or to him as it pleases you.</p>
                        <p>However, I believe that you see your own interests clearly and
                                        <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-005-4-021"/> that you will not take
                                    goods elsewhere than from us, seeing that we try only to
                                    accommodate our customers and to give them goods here at the <placeName>

                        <salute>My dear friend:–</salute>
                        <p>I do not know how this will get to you, but at any chance I wish
                                    you all a good health and a better success in your affairs than
                                    there is among us. As J think that you have gotten something out
                                    of your debtors I pray you to pay Mr. Cournoyer three or four
                                    hundred francs in peltries, that sum with the silver which he
                                    had last autumn will nearly equal the balance of my account with
                                    him, and if he should be short anything after settlement I will
                                    send it to him; it is for the tobacco which he left with me last
                                    summer which I took for my account, I flatter myself that you
                                    will arrange that with him. If you have any tobacco send two or
                                    three packages of it if you find occasion, for then I will be
                                    able to have it in case of need.</p>
                        <p>I will not speak to you of our affairs for I think they are not
                                    going better than formerly. If, however, you have any good news
                                    to tell me, let me know; that is always pleasing. Many
                                    compliments to your ladies and family [and] to our common

                        <p>We arrived at Kaskaskias early in the evening of the fourth day
                                    from Riviere des Embarras.</p>
                        <p>The 26th day ulto at daybreak a party of Americans, Sixteen in
                                    number, attacked some Miamis Lodges that were encamped within
                                    three leagues of this village, hunting and making sugar. They
                                    had been there about twenty days and consisted of Eleven men, I
                                    know not how many women and children. Seven men were kild and
                                    one wounded, also, by accident firing in the Lodges <pb n="159" id="VAA4025-005-4-023"/> two women &amp; one Girl
                                    wounded, one of the women are since dead. There was a tolerable
                                    Booty taken, Eight horses Six rifles Six packs of Skins and
                                    furs, Kettles Axes etc.–The Americans had three men
                                    of the Whiteside family wounded, but not dangerously. I am
                                    afraid this affair will cause some Indian partys Shortly to turn
                                    out, and be very troublesome to the Settlement. No news from <placeName>

                        <salute>Sir:</salute>
                        <p>I received your letter of last Month respecting a House and Lot
                                    in St. Vincennes which I claim under a Purchase from John
                                    Baptist Barcelow, whose Rect I have in February 1792 for one
                                    hundred Pounds french weight of Beaver Fur.</p>
                        <p>From what I have been able to Learn there is little Doubt but
                                    that this Mr. J. B. Barcelow has the Right to Sell, nor does it
                                    appear that he has ever sold to any one else; I am told indeed
                                    that his Father in his Life Time made some conveyance of this
                                    Lot; but his Father had no Authority for this Act and the Son
                                    when he arrives to Age must convey his own Property. This Lot
                                    was never the Right of the Father, but was conveyed to John
                                    Baptist Barcelow; who is now willing to Convey it to me or my
                                    Assigns.</p>
                        <p>If you care to take Mr. Barcelow's Right, I shall be
                                    willing to take a hundred &amp; fifty Pounds french Wt.
                                    Beaver Fur for it.</p>

            <head>INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS IN INDIANA, 1818–1846.</head>
            <byline>
                    <hi rend="i">BY MARGARET DUDEN.</hi>
                </byline>
            <p>THE State system of internal improvements which was adopted by Indiana, in 1836,
                    was not a new measure; nor did the adoption of the system, at that time, grow
                    out of a new and hasty expression of popular sentiment. For a period of more
                    than ten years the expediency of providing by law for the commencement of a
                    State system of public works had been discussed before the people of the State
                    by governors, legislators and distinguished citizens."</p>
            <p>The central and northern part of Indiana had felt a need of a system of internal
                    improvements. "The experience of the northwestern campaigns of the War
                    of 1812 had demonstrated the futility of military operations with inadequate
                    means of transporting troops and supplies. A national military highway across
                    the Old Northwest was demanded."</p>
            <p>As early as 1818, Governor Jennings, in his message, urged the consideration of a
                    system of canals and roads, saying: "The internal improvement of the
                    State forms a subject of greatest importance and deserves the most serious
                    attention. Roads and canals are calculated to afford facilities to the
                    commercial transactions connected with the exports and imports of the country,
                    by lessening the expenses and time attendant, as well on the transportation of
                    the bulky articles which compose our exports, as on the importation of articles,
                    the growth and manufactures of foreign countries, which luxury and habit have
                    rendered too common and almost indispensible to our consumption." A
                    system of canals would arouse "a more general intercourse between
                    citizens, which never fails, in a great measure, to remove the jealousies of
                    local interests, and the embittered violence of political feuds, which too often
                    produce the most undignified results to our republican institutions."</p>
            <p>In 1822 Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> conjointly began to adopt measures for the improvement of the Grand
                    Rapids of the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName>.</p>
            <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-005-4-025"/>
            <p>This was a definite step toward the development of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> route as something more than a waterway of canoe trade.</p>
            <p>And in 1823 the subject of connecting the Maumee and <geogName>Wabash
                    Rivers</geogName> by a canal navigation was considered by the legislatures of
                    both Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>"The Erie Canal had just been completed. Indiana was a growing State,
                    but it was hindered by its poor facilities for getting to market its surplus
                    products. The only market open to Indiana was that of the South. They were
                    dependent upon the flatboats which carried the surplus products to the southern
                    markets. Those countries bordering on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> were
                    the fortunate ones, for the interior settlements were practically cut off from
                    any market, except in the fall and spring."</p>
            <p>So in 1822 we find the following statements in Governor Hendricks'
                    message to the General Assembly, December, 1822: "We ought to leave
                    free and unshackled, as far as we can, our resources for improvement, and
                    purposes which the interests of the State may hereafter require, if not at our
                    hands, at the hands of those who succeed us. In this way we shall best discharge
                    our own duties, and not consult the interests of the community. Let us not lose
                    sight of those great objects to which the means of the State should, at some
                    future day be devoted–the navigation of the falls of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the improvement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, the <geogName>White river</geogName> and other
                    streams,–and the construction of the national and other roads through
                    the State."</p>
            <p>In December, 1826, Governor Ray delivered the following statement, before the
                    Assembly: "On the construction of roads and canals, then, we must rely,
                    as the safest and most certain State policy, to relieve our situation, place us
                    among the first States in the Union, and change the cry of ‘hard
                    times’, into an open acknowledgment of contentedness."
                    "We must strike at the internal improvement of the State, or form our
                    minds to remain poor and unacquainted with each other."</p>
            <p>In his message of 1827 Governor Ray again favors internal improvements,
                    especially since the Federal Government had given land to Indiana, estimated to
                    be worth $1,250,000, to aid in the construction of a canal connecting
                    Lake Erie with, the <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-005-4-026"/> Wahash river, and in

                    </placeName> to the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>In 18.32 the Internal Improvement work was begun. Mr. Cochrum in his history
                    calls attention to the fact that the Asiatic cholera had caused many deaths in
                    Indiana that year, and that the corn crops had failed; yet the canal
                    commissioners completed their surveys and prepared bonds, which were sold in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to the amount of $1,000,000 at a large premium.</p>
            <p>"The work of opening a road from <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>,
                    through <placeName>

                    </placeName>, on the <geogName>River Ohio</geogName>, was begun, under the
                    authority of the State, in 1830, and in 1832 the construction of that part of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal which lies within the borders of Indiana."
                    The amount spent for the improvement of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>.road was $54,000, of which $52,000 was
                    realized from the sale of land, appropriated for its construction.</p>
            <p>"The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> road began at Trail Creek on <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName>;
                    the road runs easterly to the southern bend of the <geogName>St. Joseph
                    river</geogName>; thence southward to the <geogName>Wabash River</geogName>,
                    which it crosses; thence to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; thence southeast to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>; thence south again to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>." This road served as a route for immigration, but it lost
                    its usefulness when the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal was built.</p>
            <p>In 1832, thirty-two miles of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal were placed under contract.</p>
            <p>Little progress was made during the first year, although local interest ran high.
                    Meetings were held along the line to promote the rapid building of the canal.
                    Committees worked to secure, legislative action for additional surveys. The
                    scarcity of. good material for locks and waterways proved the greatest obstacle.
                    By 1834 a small part near Ft. Wayne had been completed, and the first canal boat
                    launched.</p>
            <p>The enthusiasm for the canal was great at the very beginning. "The old
                    Northwest is especially well adapted to the development of canals. The broad
                    strip between the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> and the lakes is remarkably
                    void of elevations deserving the names of mountains. Sluggish streams abound
                    through its vast plains. Broad alluvial valleys follow the larger streams and
                    invite the <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-005-4-027"/> construction of canals and
                    railroads. Few locks were necessary, and the material like timber and stone were
                    close at hand."</p>
            <p>During the year 1835, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal was rapidly constructed. The middle division
                    extending from <geogName>St. Joseph river</geogName> to the forks of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>-, was completed. This finished section was thirty-one miles in
                    length and cost $232,000.</p>
            <p>But, in the meantime, it had been necessary to make another loan of
                    $400,000. Transferable certificates of stock, 6 per cent., for
                    twenty-five years, were issued.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless by the middle of summer boats were running on this part of the
                    canal.</p>
            <p>During the period 1830-1835, the population of Indiana increased greatly. The
                    necessity for roads and means of transportation grew with the population. The
                    financial success of the Erie canal aroused among the newer States a similar
                    enthusiasm for internal improvements.</p>
            <p>Accordingly a bill, known as the Mammoth Bill, was presented to the Legislature
                    of 1835. The cost of the system was estimated at $5,910,000. The plan
                    provided for an extensioa of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>; also for a network of connecting canals, railroads and turnpikes.
                    The discussions upon this bill were animated, nevertheless it failed at the
                    first session, because of a demand for more definite information.</p>
            <p>In 1835 the Legislature appropriated the sum of $227,000. to extend
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal from the mouth of the <geogName>Tippecanoe
                    river</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The same legislature desired to investigate the feasibility of the
                    Mammoth Bill, therefore it provided for a series of surveys.</p>
            <p>During the elections of 1835, the question of internal improvements became an
                    issue.</p>
            <p>The General Assembly met December, 1836, and Governor Noble in his message
                    recommended the expenditure of $10,000,-000 on such a system of
                    internal improvements.</p>
            <p>The Legislature passed a bill providing for a system of improvements, which had
                    been introduced on January 27, 1836. In the House sixty-five had voted for it,
                    and in the Senate it passed with a two-thirds majority.</p>
            <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-005-4-028"/>
            <p>This bill provided for a Board of Internal Improvements, which was to consist of
                    nine members. These members were to receive their appointment from the governor.</p>
            <p>The act benefited all sections of the State, for it provided for a system of
                    trunpikes, canals and railroads, with the <placeName>

                    arteries.</p>
            <p>The passage of this act caused great rejoicing throughout the State. It was
                    expected and believed that the revenuesthe State would enjoy from the various
                    works would make taxation unnecessary. The system was expected to make all men
                    rich. A period of wild speculation followed. Trading of air kind became active.
                    The provisions of the Act of 1836 are as follows:</p>
            <p>I. The Whitewater Canal was to extend from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The act provided for a connection between the said Whitewater
                    canal, and the Central canal, either a connection by canal or by railroad. One
                    million four hundred thousand dollars was appropriated. If <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> declined to construct the part of the canal which would be in her
                    territory, the commissioners were to construct a railroad from some point near
                    Harrison to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, wholly within Indiana. (This canal had been agitated as early as
                    1822. The survey and location and contracts for building the various sections
                    were let at Brook-ville September 13,. 1836, under the auspices of the State.
                    The canal was completed from the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as well as about one-half of the work from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1839. The session of 1841-'42 Legislature chartered
                    the <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName> Company, with a capital stock of
                    $400,000. In October, 1843, the canal was extended from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, twelve miles farther, in June, 1845! and October, 1845, it was
                    completed to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The entire cost to the company was $743,000. It was
                    operated for several years until the <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName>
                    railroad superseded it. The canal company constructed the canal only as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cambridge City</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1846 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hagerstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal Company was organized and the canal reached that place in
                    1847. But the canal soon fell into disuse except as a source of water-power.)</p>

            <p>(The section from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Broad Ripple was the. only completed portion. The work was begun
                    in 1837,. and prosecuted up to 1838. A great deal of work was done on the canal
                    between <placeName>

            <p>A loan of $10,000,000 had to be made in order to begin this system.</p>
            <p>In 1836, thirty-one miles of the Whitewater canal from Law-renceburg to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was placed under contract, also twenty-three miles of the Central
                    canal, which was to pass through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Twenty miles of the southern division of this work, from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> into the interior, was also placed-under contract, and the
                    cross-cut canal from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> to where it intersected the Central canal near the mouth of
                        <geogName>Eel river</geogName>, was all under contract for construction.</p>
            <p>As soon as the work was begun, there was a great desire on the part of the people
                    to see it finished without delay.</p>
            <p>In his message of 1836, Governor Noble feared, "That the rapid
                    disbursement of money would lead to extravagance, high-living, and then a
                    reaction, when the system would become a burden."</p>
            <p>If all the works authorized had been completed, they would have cost
                    $30,000,000, and the whole tolls would not have paid for the repairs
                    of the first twenty years. In many places public works were begun where there
                    was no surplus of labor or of produce, and here the lot speculator was the only
                    person who could be profited. It was a fortunate thing that the credit of the
                    State failed before all the indebtedness contemplated had been incurred.</p>

            <p>"The causes for the disastrous outcome were various. The financial
                    distress which swept over the country in 1837 was partly to blame." The
                    tolls were insufficient, and the authorities lost largely by selling bonds on
                    credit. In several cases the purchaser failed through unsuccessful speculation
                    to be able to meet his obligations to the State. When the crash came there was a
                    general suspension of every sort of business. The State's financial
                    ruin was great.</p>
            <p>In 1839, the entire State system of public works was paralyzed. The State could
                    not find purchasers for its bonds. The payments of the contractors ceased on
                    their contracts. The board could no longer meet its obligations, and
                    consequently abandoned all work in August, 1839.</p>
            <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-005-4-032"/>
            <p>In order to provide means for the payment of the contractors, and other public
                    creditors, the Legislature authorized an issue of State treasury notes to the
                    amount of $1,500,000. These notes formed a circulating medium which
                    for a brief period passed at its normal value, but early in the summer of 1842,
                    when there was about $1,000;000 of this currency in circulation among
                    the people, it suddenly depreciated in value from 40 to 50 per cent.</p>
            <p>The"" Legislature of 1841 passed a law. authorizing any private
                    company to take charge of, and to complete any of the works, with the exception
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and 'Erie Canal, which was retained by the State. The act
                    abolished the Board of Internal Improvements, the office of fund commissioner
                    and chief engineer. It provided also for a State agent who was to perform the
                    duties of the fund commissioner.</p>
            <p>By 1841 the State debt grew to $13,148,453 of which
                    $9,464,453 was on account of the internal improvement system. This
                    sum steadily increased because of the unpaid interest. On the other hand,
                    Indiana had two hundred miles of canal in use, yielding $5,000 in
                    'tolls, two railroads yielding $26,000 annually, and several
                    useless fragments of canals.</p>
            <p>The Cross Cut canal, and the southern division of the Central canal, on which
                    little had been accomplished, became integral parts of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie waterway on its extension to the <geogName>Ohio
                    river</geogName>.</p>
            <p>The State made several attempts to finish the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal, and in 1841, it was successfully operated from Ft.
                    Wayne to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and paid a fair revenue to the State, In 1841 and 1845 Congress
                    made a second and third grant of land to aid in the construction of the canal.
                    But all. these efforts were futile.</p>
            <p>The Legislature of 1845 had two problems which confronted it. (1) To complete the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal; (2) To manage the State debt.</p>
            <p>Indiana, however, was not the only State which had embarrassing financial
                    conditions, as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> defaulted in their payments of interest.</p>
            <p>At this time the dissatisfied creditors both of Europe and <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-005-4-033"/> America, appointed a Mr. Charles Butler as their
                    agent, in order that he should endeavor to obtain relief for the bondholders.</p>
            <p>The Legislature of 1846 finally solved the problem by passing the Butler Bill.
                    This bill divided the State debt into two parts. As to the one part, the State
                    agreed to pay interest and ultimately the principal out of taxation. For the
                    interest and principal of the other half, the creditors consented to look to.
                    the revenues of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal. This canal was placed under a board of trustees,
                    one member of which was to be chosen by the State Legislature, and two members
                    were to be selected by the bondholders. The canal was not placed in the hands of
                    the bondholders, but the canal was placed in trust for their benefit.</p>
            <p>In 1847 the, board met. Mr. Butler was chosen president. The newly organized
                    board of trustees received the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> wid Erie canal in 1847. It was completed by this management to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in. 1849, and to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1854. The entire length of the canal in Indiana was 375 miles.
                    It extended 84 miles in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. This made a total of 459 miles. The enormous work, which cost so
                    many million dollars, lasted only a few years, owing to its being paralleled the
                    entire length by railroads. The canal caused a large emigration to the sections
                    for many miles on both sides of the canal throughout its entire length.</p>
            <p>Thirty-eight counties in Tndiarra~ and nearly nine counties in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, including an average of 22,000 square miles, were directly
                    affected by the canal.</p>
            <p>In 1874, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> and Erie canal was abandoned. The court ordered a sale of the
                    canal. The property with the right of way and lands were sold February 12, 1877,
                    to speculators, but no attempt was made to repair and maintain the canal. It
                    rapidly fell into complete ruin, and as a money-making institution the canal had
                    utterly failed.</p>
            <p>Many towns which had suddenly sprung into existence as promising centers, have
                    passed with the canal, as for example Lagro, Lewisburg, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Georgetown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Carrolton, Americus and Lock-port, all of which are almost
                    forgotten. Miss Coman, in her Industrial History of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, says: "We see then <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-005-4-034"/>
                    that the crisis of 1837 checked the mania for canal building none too soon. Much
                    of the capital so invested was lost, for the canal was destined to be superseded
                    by the railroad. Canal traffic was often interfered with by slack water, floods
                    and frosts; the traffic was necessarily slow. A railroad can be built through
                    the mountainous country at one-third of the cost of a canal, and over heights
                    water can not be conducted over."</p>
            <p>And so in Indiana we find the railroads, which were usually built by joint stock
                    companies and chartered by the State Legislatures, taking the place of canals.
                    But the construction of railroads forms another chapter of Indiana history.</p>

            <p>IN the letters which follow will be found a touch of the political feeling which
                    existed shortly after the war between the States. The authors of the letters and

                    political drama of the time. They were all prominent public characters, and
                    their patriotism was always beyond 'question.</p>

                    essentially national in its scope and character. It was recognition of this fact
                    that induced Mr. Hendricks to say that the democracy of Indiana owed Mr.

                        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
                        <p>Your favor of the 25th is rec'd. I take it for granted
                                    that Judge Davis will not resign before the 4th March. I think
                                    he will favor Drummond as his successor–but do not
                                    know. He is a good judge but an ultra opponent of the Democrats.
                                    Mr. Senator McDonald will have a good deal of influence in the
                                    opposition. You had better write to him at once. Should Gov.
                                    Tilden &amp; myself be declared elected I cannot yet say
                                    what will be my position towards the administration touching
                                    appointments. It has heretofore been held that the V. President
                                    can have nothing to say. I do not see any reason for that, and I
                                    am sure no such rule ought to apply to myself, nominated as I
                                    was. I will be very glad to see you appointed. I will drop a
                                    note to Senator McDonald, that he may not commit himself. In ten
                                    or twelve days we will know who is to control the appointment.
                                    Should Judge Swayne be the 5th man of the Court, I will feel
                                    that the result is very doubtful. He is an intensely bitter
                                    partisan.</p>

            <p>[N<hi rend="sc">OTE</hi>.–This letter deals with questions growing out
                    of the campaign when it was claimed that Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A.
                    Hendricks were elected President and Vice-President, respectively, of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Judge David Davis had recently been elected <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. This would cause a vacancy on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> circuit court bench. <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-005-4-037"/>
                    Evidently, Mr. Doolittle was seeking to have this appointment go to him. And he
                    was interesting Mr. Hendricks in his behalf, in case the Democratic candidates
                    for President and Vice-President were given the certificates of election.
                    Subsequent events, however, established the success of the Republican
                    candidates, Hayes and Wheeler, and with it went the hopes and ambitions of Judge
                    Doolittle. This letter has some interest as giving some estimate of officers in
                    the public eye at the time of its writing. It shows, too, a warm place in Mr.
                    Hendricks's bosom for his political friend and associate, ex-Senator
                    Doolittle, of <placeName>

                                    take the liberty of suggesting that you seize an opportunity to
                                    do so, in order that the record of this campaign may be valuable

                    interesting political history. It also emphasizes the great influence and power
                    of Mr. Doolittle as an effective campaigner. The speech, of course, was
                    delivered some time during the fall of 1880, and prior to the date of the letter
                    of General Hancock.]</p>
            <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-005-4-038"/>
            <p>The subjoined letter from Judge Doolittle to Mr. Hendricks is valuable from
                    several points of view. It deals with interesting data connected with President
                    Johnson's administration, with which, of course, Judge Doolittle was
                    very familiar. What he says about that administration may be regarded as
                    authoritative, because his confidential relations with it are matters of
                    history. He was a confidential adviser of Mr. Johnson, and he had been
                    previously of Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Doolittle's discussion of the political
                    outlook with his political friend is interesting, if not altogether convincing.
                    He was right in predicting the nomination of Mr. Cleveland for President. But it
                    seems that Mr. Hendricks was to be his running mate. However, those of us who
                    knew Judge Doolittle, believe his letter was entirely honest and sincere. He
                    thought here was the opportunity to win a State and a national victory at the
                    same time.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to find many letters prepared by Judge Doolittle in his private
                    correspondence. It was not his practice to keep copies of his letters, but this
                    seems to be an exception to the rule. A diligent search has been made to find,
                    if possible, Mr. Hendricks's reply, but it has not been discovered. It
                    would be interesting to know what was his answer to Mr. Doolittle's
                    suggestion to stand for governor.</p>
            <p>The readers of your quarterly are to be congratulated to have the opportunity to
                    read this interesting letter. It has never been offered for publication before.</p>

                        <salute>My Dear Sir–</salute>
                        <p>Upon conference with Mr. Kimball, one of my intimate friends, I
                                    have determined to write you upon a matter of great personal
                                    interest to you, and to our cause.</p>
                        <p>After I saw Mr. Tilden, at his home, at Graystone, last November,
                                    I knew his candidacy was simply impossible. Your name was so
                                    associated with his upon the "old ticket," in
                                    the memories, affections, and, if you please, in the patriotic
                                    indignation of the whole Democratic party of the country, that a
                                    separation of the <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-005-4-039"/> two
                                    names, and a breach of the "old ticket" was
                                    also impossible, as it seemed to me.</p>
                        <p>I was also led to think, that in the existing state of things,
                                    neither your name with Mr. Tilden's, nor separate from
                                    it, would this year, be likely to be placed in nomination upon
                                    the "Ticket," for President, or, for Vice
                                    President.</p>
                        <p>The action of the convention in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>, yesterday, makes it almost morally certain, that
                                    Gov. Cleveland will be our candidate for President; and, from
                                    all that has been said by other conventions, and by the press,
                                    as well as from private correspondence, it seems likely that
                                    Col. McDonald will be placed in nomination for Vice President,
                                    if our friends outside of Indiana are satisfied that it meets
                                    with your approval.</p>
                        <p>And now my dear sir, allow me as one of your sincere friends to
                                    say, in all frankness, I hope it will accord with your best
                                    judgment, and the good of our cause, to allow our friends in
                                    Indiana, to place your name, in nomination for Governor. Not
                                    that it will add any honor to those already conferred upon you,
                                    by your great state; but that it can give the whole country the

                        <p>For myself, I have no aspirations for any place, whatever. I look
                                    for my reward, not in official position, but in my vindication.
                                    I have fought the good fight of faith. I have fought for <hi rend="i">principle</hi>; whether that led me to act <hi rend="i">with, or against, the Democratic party,</hi> or,
                                        <hi rend="i">with, or against, the Republican party</hi>,</p>
                        <p>In 1847, when, by treaty, we had acquired the Free Territories
                                    from Mexico, and Gen'l Cass proposed by
                                    "diffusion of slavery" to spread it out so
                                    thin in the Territories that it would die out of itself, I was
                                    severed from the Democratic party, under his lead, and helped to
                                    organize the Free Soil party.</p>
                        <p>Then a young man, from Western <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, I offered in the Democratic Convention, A
                                    Resolution "declaring the uncompromising hostility of
                                    the Democracy of <placeName>

                                    General Government."</p>
                        <p>That resolution was rejected, or laid on the table "by

                                    idea was not destroyed. A copy of the resolution was preserved.
                                    On that rejected resolution, called the "Corner Stone
                                    Resolution," the Free Soil party was organized. It sent
                                    a Delegation to.<placeName>

                                    their votes neutralized by a hostile Delegation. They withdrew
                                    from the Convention, (I among them). We nominated Martin Van
                                    Buren. Then followed the Buffalo convention; which also
                                    nominated Van Buren, and Chas. Francis Adams. The result was,

                        <p>Then came a truce. Both parties pledged themselves anew, not to

                        <p>My war against the Democratic party then ceased; and I supported

                                    measure once before the Senate, began its work of mischief; till
                                    at last, Douglas gave way,–hoping that with the

                                    of the question. The result was, it only opened wide the

                                    combat. It, in fact, began, right then and there, the Civil War,
                                    which,-afterwards, led hundreds of thousands of brothers, with
                                    hands stained in brother's blood, to battle and to

                        <p>The establishment of the Slave Code of <placeName>

                                    Congress to sustain that Code by the Federal Army, again severed
                                    me from that party; and I <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-005-4-041"/>
                                    joined to help organize the Republican party of 1856. In 1857 I
                                    entered the Senate. You know all the rest. I will not repeat
                                    what is so familiar to you.</p>
                        <p>The Republican party was organized as a <hi rend="i">states
                                        rights party.</hi> While it opposed slavery extension into
                                    the Free Territories, it denounced any invasion of the rights of
                                    the states as among the gravest of crimes. It was born of a
                                    protest against Federal usurpation; a protest against the
                                    Fugitive Slave Law; a protest against the Slave Code of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                                    </placeName>; and, especially, a protest against using the
                                    Federal Army to enforce that Code; and to force upon a people, a
                                    Constitution which they had rejected, but which was declared
                                    adopted upon a false return of more than 5,000 votes of men,
                                    whose names were never found in <placeName>

                        <p>In saying that the Republican party was organized as a states
                                    rights party, I speak only of what I know, for I drew the very
                                    call upon which the Republican party, the People's
                                    party of <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, were brought together in the convention at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, in 1860, which nominated Mr. Lincoln.</p>
                        <p>The rights of the states were recognized in the strongest terms,
                                    not only in the platform on which Mr. Lincoln was elected, but
                                    especially, in that resolution of July, 1861, after the war had
                                    begun, passed unanimously by Congress, two days after the
                                    disaster at Bull Run,–the most solemn declaration a
                                    nation could make, before God and the civilized world.</p>
                        <p>But after Lincoln's assassination, the control of the
                                    Republican party passed into the hands of Thad. Stevens; who
                                    really had more power than ever Robespierre had in the French
                                    Convention, and in all its ideas it was revolutionized, and
                                    carried right over and entirely outside of the Constitution.</p>
                        <p>His great genius, indomitable will, and his great passions,
                                    inflamed into an intensity of hate, by the destruction of his
                                    Iron Works by the rebel forces at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, made him burn and flame like an electric light, so
                                    intense and fierce that lesser lights were dim; and the Blaines
                                    and Logans were boys under him.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, President Johnson, as true a patriot as ever
                                    lived, by his want of tact and by his mistakes in <hi rend="i">extemporeé</hi>
                                    <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-005-4-042"/>
                                    <hi rend="i">speeches</hi> in which he would indulge, in spite
                                    of the advice and counsel of his best friends, lost control, and
                                    the power to hold on to the policy of Lincoln. Johnson refused
                                    to appoint Morton in his Cabinet, which place Morton was ready
                                    to accept, after his <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                                    </placeName> speech. Had Johnson done so, Morton had sufficient
                                    organizing power, with Johnson's aid, to resist Stevens
                                    and his followers in their radical revolution. But he did not
                                    appoint him Secretary of War. He kept Stanton to betray and to
                                    ruin him; to betray and to ruin Lincoln's policy, of
                                    Reconstruction under the Constitution. Though Stanton himself
                                    drew the very Reconstruction Proclamation, and though it was
                                    unanimously approved by all Lincoln's Cabinet, twice
                                    read over in presence of Gen'l Grant himself, yet
                                    Stanton betrayed it under Stevens' lead.</p>
                        <p>Then came the rejection of Sherman's terms of
                                    Capitulation by Johnson's army, because it seemed to
                                        <hi rend="i">recognize the States of the South as being
                                        still states in the Union</hi>.</p>
                        <p>To cut this letter short, Stevens and his followers got complete
                                    control of the Republican party, and revolutionized it. He
                                    boldly declared that we were <hi rend="i">"outside"</hi> the Constitution, in
                                    dealing with all the States South of the Potomac.</p>
                        <p>Then, under Stevens, the Republican party did, what the Rebellion
                                    could not do; it broke the Union. It expelled ten States. It
                                    reduced them to Five Military Provinces. It subjugated
                                    10,000,000, of people to military law. It abolished all civil
                                    law from the Potomac to the Rio Grande; and, (to quote

                        <p>Time fails me to tell you of all its great crimes; of the
                                    degradation and corruption of the South; of Disfranchising by
                                    Test Oaths the intelligence and character of the South; of
                                    filling their Legislatures with ignorance and stupidity; of the
                                    robbery by carpet-bag thieves of those states by the fraudulent
                                    issue of bonds, to $126,000,000; of the degradation
                                    of the suffrage of the South, instead of qualifying and
                                    elevating it, and with it elevating the enfranchised race; of
                                    all these things, which make the <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-005-4-043"/> heart sick to recall. Add to all
                                    this the <hi rend="i">nepotism, corruption, whiskey thief
                                        jobbing</hi> of Grant's administrations, and both
                                    of them, which show that great as he was as.a soldier, he never
                                    had any more fitness for the civil duties of President, than he
                                    has lately shown himself fit to be the head of a great Banking
                                    House in Wall Street.</p>
                        <p>Add to that, the great unpunished fraud and outrage of 1876. The
                                    bribery, by which half a million stolen from the Treasury by
                                    Star Route thieves under Dorsey, was spent to buy votes in
                                    Indiana in 1880; and more humiliating, even, than Bribery
                                    itself, the fact that Arthur, the present President of the <placeName>
                                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                                    </placeName>, without blushing, at a public dinner, when an
                                    ex-president sat by his side, openly, as if honors were being
                                    given to some great, conquering hero, boasted of the achievement
                                    of Carrying Indiana by wholesale Bribery, as if it were a great
                                    victory.</p>
                        <p>O, my friend! when I think of this party in power, having thus
                                    proved faithless to the Idea upon which it was elected, upon
                                    which I helped to form and organize it, how, instead of being a
                                    states rights party, maintaining the Union to be sovereign in
                                    all national affairs, and that the States are still sovereign in
                                    all their domestic affairs, it has now become the party of
                                    Centralization;–substantially denying the obligations
                                    and limitations of a Written Constitution, and maintaining that
                                    Congress can do any thing and every thing which it is not
                                    expressly forbidden to do;–and, that it is all
                                    honey-combed through and through with corruption; when I call
                                    all these things to mind, words fail to express the necessity to
                                    overthrow that party; and to place the administration in the
                                    hands of the true Democratic Republican party, regenerated as it
                                    now seems to be, and to bring true and genuine reform with it,
                                    into every branch of the government.</p>
                        <p>Let me therefore, knowing as I do your devoted love for the
                                    country for which you have labored and sacrificed so much,

                                    the candidate for Governor of Indiana. By that act, close up the

                        <salute>My Dear Sir–</salute>
                        <p>Though Governor Tilden has never been sick in bed a day since I
                                    have known him, now more than forty years, nor ever so ill as
                                    not to attend to current affairs, he is not strong and has no
                                    expectation of being ever any stronger. He does not feel that if
                                    elected to the Presidency he could realise the reasonable
                                    expectations of his friends or of the country. It was this
                                    apprehension which led him to decline the nomination in 1880 and
                                    there is no reason operating now, except the greater apparent
                                    unanimity of the party and the deduction of four years from the
                                    working balance of his life, that was not operative then.</p>
                        <p>I take no responsibility in saying, not only that the Governor
                                    does not wish the office but he does wish not to assume the
                                    burdens which it would impose upon him.</p>
                        <p>From a conviction that the anxieties of a canvass and the labor
                                    incident to a regeneration of our administrative system would
                                    interfere with the regularity of life and the repose which are
                                    indispensable to his health and comfort, I approved entirely of
                                    his course in 1880 and I am very reluctantly constrained to
                                    approve of the course which he now seems determined to pursue.</p>
                        <p>I regret that from the very nature of the situation I can not
                                    give a more explicit answer to your favor of the 2d inst., nor
                                    one more in harmony with what I suppose to be your feelings.</p>

            <p>THE chapters, from their reports, show a healthy vigor and growth along historic
                    lines. Their programs are worthy of a place with the programs of literary clubs.
                    The zeal and interest in patriotic education; in locating and marking the graves
                    of Revolutionary soldiers and other historic spots; the steady and patient
                    endeavor to Americanize our foreign newcomers—all this work, so dear
                    to the hearts of our most American Hoosiers, is growing and strengthening daily.</p>
            <p>One strong indication of this growth is the wonderful formation of new chapters;
                    thirty-seven counties are now represented by the forty-five chapters that have
                    been established in our State since the work was begun in 1894 by Mrs. Chapin C.
                    Foster, our first State Regent. The history of our earlier years shows what
                    uphill work was this forming of chapters; but as each chapter is established it
                    does its part in a very important branch of patriotic education—the
                    spreading of the spirit of patriotism among our own people. As each chapter is
                    formed, the near neighbors' ambition is aroused, and now it has almost
                    become a question whether our State Regent shall organize at once, or form a
                    waiting list and organize as fast as she can get around to them.</p>
            <p>In July your historian sent a circular letter to each regent asking the
                    cooperation of the chapters in collecting fragmentary history of early Indiana,
                    accounts of early settlers, court-house records, old letters and documents. This
                    letter has already met with a generous response from several chapters.</p>
            <p>The Manitou Chapter of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rochester</settlement>
                    </placeName> has a member, Marguerite Miller, who had already collected and
                    printed in book form biographical sketches of the early settlers of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName> county—not hearsay accounts, but the story of these
                    early lives and struggles with the hardships in the wilderness by the very
                    people who experienced them. It is a splendid piece of work.</p>
            <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-005-4-046"/>
            <p>Mary Penrose Wayne Chapter, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has sent me a similar publication, "Reminiscences of Old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> by Those Who Know."</p>
            <p>A week after these letters were sent out, without having heard of the work your
                    historian was endeavoring to induce others to take up, I was assigned by the
                    Indiana Historical Society the editing of a pamphlet containing the
                    "Assessment List of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1835," together with a biographical sketch of the
                    assessor, George M. Lockerbie. The preparation of this sketch brought to light
                    many interesting and valuable incidents connected with the early history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Also, shortly after the circular letters were well on their way, Mrs. Mortimer
                    Levering, who within the year has written a book on early Indiana, wrote me
                    suggesting that the Daughters start this work in Indiana. All this goes to show
                    that the wave of historical research which enthusiastic Daughters started
                    eighteen years ago is still rolling over our land, and that Indiana Daughters
                    are not out of its track.</p>

            <p>The American Historical Association cerebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary at
                    the annual meeting at <placeName>

                    </placeName> this month. The date is December 27-31, Monday to Friday. As is
                    customary, the historians will be joined by the American Economic, American
                    Political Science, American Statistical, American Social Science, and
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> Historical Associations, the
                    American Sociological Society, the American Association for Labor Legislation,
                    the Bibliographical Society of America, and the American Society of Church
                    History. This formidable array of learning will undoubtedly eclipse the
                    Hudson-Fulton celebration of the early autumn. Several of the foremost

                    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which gives a luncheon Monday noon; <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University, which gives the freedom of the university buildings and
                    several luncheons and receptions and a dinner; the <placeName>

                    held several of the meetings of the American Economic Association. The social
                    features of the session close with a reception by Mr. and Mrs. William K.
                    Vanderbilt at their residence on Fifth avenue and Fifty-second street. The
                    headquarters of the American Historical and the American Economic Associations
                    will be at the Waldorf-Astoria.</p>

                    </placeName> Among the sessions which will attract the widest interest are
                    doubtless the opening night meeting at Carnegie Hall, at which there are to be
                    addresses by President Taft, Governor Hughes, Mayor McClellan, Dr. Nicholas
                    Murray Butler and others, the presidential addresses by Professor Albert
                    Bushnell Hart, of the Historical Association, and Professor Davis R. Dewey, of
                    the Economic Association, and the breakfast at the Waldorf-Astoria, with
                    reception to foreign guests and brief addresses, Wednesday noon. Among the well-
                        <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-005-4-056"/> known guests from abroad are expected
                    Mr. Prothero, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The program as a whole is unusually attractive and strong.</p>
            <p>Those going from the central and southern portion of Indiana will probably find
                    the most convenient train is that leaving <placeName>

                    number will attend from this State, especially in view of the fact that the next
                    succeeding meeting of the Association is to be in <placeName>
