				<head rend="center">PREFACE</head>
				<p>T<hi rend="sc">HESE</hi> plays are really dramatic pageants, and the various acts are,
					with few exceptions, episodes, with different characters and representing different
					periods of time. Many of the episodes are in themselves complete plays, and can be
					presented for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Flag Day, Washington's Birthday, and so on. For
					example, Act I of <hi rend="i">A Dream of Gold</hi> and Act II of <hi rend="i">The Man who
						bore the Burden</hi> are suitable for Christmas. Any one of the acts of <hi rend="i">A
						Dream of Freedom</hi> or of <hi rend="i">Troubles on Land and Sea</hi> could be used for
					Thanksgiving. For Flag Day, Fourth of July, and other patriotic celebrations, there is
					abundant material in <hi rend="i">The Boston Tea Party, When Courage was needed</hi>, and
						<hi rend="i">A Brave Deed by Brave Men</hi>. Any one of the episodes in <hi rend="i">The
						Man who bore the Burden</hi> could be used as a play for February 22.</p>

				<p>Whether these plays are read in class or acted in costume, their influence will be
					strong. The nobility and courage of our forefathers, who stood forth so bravely for
					justice, become, through the medium of dramatic action, vital and real. Nor is it too much
					to believe that this very nobility and courage will be absorbed unconsciously and help to
					form the character of the boys and girls who read <pb id="VAA9493-004" n="iv"/> and speak
					their words. Moreover, these plays, by their appeal to the imagination, will awaken a new
					and lively interest in American history.</p>

				<p>Infinite pains were taken in the preparation of the plays. The research required to
					gather the material, with the setting of each scene and its true historic atmosphere, has
					been great. The best historical sources were sought and all facts verified by the highest
					authorities. For the correctness of the historic data I am indebted to Dr. Allen Johnson,
					Professor of American history, Yale University. His criticisms were most valuable, and
					enabled me to place certain characters and scenes in their true proportions. </p>

							<p>My children, long have we been happy here in the land of our fathers. Many
								generations of our people have tilled this soil-- have hunted in these forests. The
								neighboring tribes are at peace with us and pay us their yearly tribute. And so it
								hath been during my lifetime-- happiness prosperity. And now behold what hath
								happened! Strange men have come unbid to our fair home. They have seized our land
								which hath come to us from our fathers. They cut our trees, they hunt where they
								choose, they ask not Powhatan for permission. They come to our village-- they speak
								as friends, but they cannot deceive us longer. They said they had landed here to
								mend their ships and would go when that was finished. But the ships have gone and
								they have remained. And then, after many moons, came other ships with <pb
									id="VAA9493-026" n="20"/> other strange men. And with them came a woman and girl.
								And their ships have gone and they also remain. Soon others will come, and then
								others. Do you see now what will happen? We will be driven back to bare mountains
								while they take our richest valley. Shall we endure this, braves? Shall we sit by
								and permit it? Speak.</p>

							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ERCY</hi>.</speaker>

								<p>Your Honor will pardon the abruptness of my call when you know 't was made

									England.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I am deeply interested, my lord.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Briefly, then, the matter is this: It hath recently come to the king's knowledge
									that certain books are being printed here in Leyden-- <pb id="VAA9493-105" n="99"
									/> books which offend his Majesty greatly. In fact they are written by Puritans
									and printed by Puritans and glorify the Puritan faith.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Holland permits the free publication of religious books by any sect or
									society.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But these books are being shipped to England, where the printing and sale of
									Puritan books hath long ago been prohibited. His Majesty therefore asks that your
									Honor suppress their publication here in Leyden.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>We have no jurisdiction over that, Sir Dudley.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Your Honor, the king <hi rend="i">requests</hi> that the press and type be
									seized, and the publisher be imprisoned.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But, my lord, 't is beyond my authority! Besides, this publisher is a man who is
									much respected here. He is one William Brewster, an Englishman, who hath been here
									many years.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But he hath offended King James-- and this is not the first time. He was one of
									those Scrooby Puritans who defied the king and then ran away with his fellows. And
									so, with all these things, the king is exceedingly wroth and desires you to
									imprison him.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>'T would offend the whole body of Puritans who have all made splendid citizens.
									For twelve years have they been here, and in all that time not one case of trouble
									hath arisen amongst <pb id="VAA9493-106" n="100"/> them or between them and the
									Dutch people. They are industrious, and so honest that, if any desire credit, he
									has only to say he is a Puritan.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Be that as it may, his Majesty desires that a way be found to arrest this
									Brewster, even to the creating of a new law to cover the case.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I have no power to create new laws. That rests with our reigning prince, my
									lord.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I have written your prince recently in regard to the matter.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I have not heard from his Highness.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Then, pending his letter, I ask that you hold this Brewster as a prisoner.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Did I consent to that, I would soon have a mob of howling students about me, for
									the Puritan pastor, Master Robinson, is very popular at the University. He is
									frequently asked to debate with the professors, who hold him in great esteem and
									declare him to be one of the most intellectual men in all Europe. Do you see,
									then, what a hornet's nest I would be stirring up by the arrest of one of his
									chief elders?</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Nevertheless, a way must be found. I have never known his Majesty more determined
									in any matter. Indeed, if Holland does not yield to him in this matter, he
									threatens to give her no <pb id="VAA9493-107" n="101"/> support should Spain
									declare war against her-- as does now seem likely.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi></speaker>
								<stage>(<hi rend="i">alarmed</hi>).</stage>
								<p>Hath his Majesty said that?</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Aye, and bade me tell you so, should all other arguments fail. Holland cannot
									afford to lose England's friendship now, your Honor. Spain is a rich and powerful
									country and could crush you out of existence, if England did not help you.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">URGOMASTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Did you mention this point in your letter to the prince?</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">MBASSADOR</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Yes, your Honor, I made it very clear.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>

							<sp>

								<p>I do perceive you are troubled--</p>

								<p>Master Cathkin's arrest!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>The king's officers found out that Master Cathkin was receiving our books in

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Oh, it doth grieve me to hear that! I will arrange to pay his fine in some

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>The king would not permit it, even if you could do so. His Majesty hath said
									openly that Master Cathkin shall suffer for this-- and, moreover, that you shall
									suffer with him.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>King James cannot touch me here. Holland would not permit it.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But Holland hath never as yet been tested. King James hath made no demand on her
									for the arrest of any Puritan.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>No, nor is he like to. He knows Holland will not betray us.</p>

								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>In spite of that I am troubled, and so is Master Robinson. Indeed, he would have

								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>There is no need of alarm for me. <pb id="VAA9493-112" n="106"/> Our whole

								<p>It seems there is some danger of a war between Holland and Spain within the next

								<p>My people, Captain Miles Standish hath told you of this new trouble that hath
									arisen for us in England's recent treaty with Holland, and you understand our
									danger. If King James sees fit, we may be all taken back to England and thrown
									into dungeons. Therefore, we must act quickly that we may escape this fate.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>King James hath most likely forgot us-- it hath been twelve years.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>He hath only recently declared that Master Brewster should suffer with Master

							<sp>
								<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Then there is, indeed, great need of action with us. We cannot remain in
									Holland.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>W<hi rend="sc">INSLOW</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Unless we renounce our faith. And that, of course, we can never do.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>No, never! 'T was for that we came in poverty here and have endured so many
									hardships.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Aye!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Then we must leave Holland, my people. We have often spoken of this before,
									especially in our first years here. But always we gave up the thought. Now
									necessity compels it. We must go to <pb id="VAA9493-116" n="110"/> a land where
									our faith can be preserved from generation to generation. And that land, friends,
									as you know full well, is America.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">ISTRESS</hi> W<hi rend="sc">INSLOW</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But 't is a wilderness and inhabited by savages!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>'T is the only place where we may continue to worship as we will.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">REWSTER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And, besides, the opportunity is ours of converting the savages there to our
									belief.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>To spread our faith is ever our bounden duty.</p>
							</sp>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">Murmurs of assent from others</hi>.)</stage>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I favor going to America as soon as ships can be got.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>W<hi rend="sc">INSLOW</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I favor it likewise, and urge it.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>I oppose it strongly. We have just begun to make fair wages here. We have our
									homes here-- we are able to care for our children. And it hath taken us twelve
									years to arrive at this point. Shall we leave all this and begin again the fight
									for merely enough to eat and to wear? I tell you, I oppose it!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And I, sir, oppose it too! What can we do in a new land? We came very near to
									making an utter failure here.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Ah, but the case is different. We were, nearly all of us, farmers in England, and
									we found the trade here was weaving.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And we found also, that we could not <pb id="VAA9493-117" n="111"/> compete with
									the skilled weavers here until we had years of experience. But in America we can
									be farmers again, and teach our sons to be farmers.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But suppose they refuse to be farmers. They have gotten a taste of the sea here
									and many of them are sailors.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">ISTRESS</hi> C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>That is the pity of it! They are going away from us and forgetting their
									faith.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">ISTRESS</hi> W<hi rend="sc">INSLOW</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Our children are forgetting they are English. They speak the Dutch language--
									they play the Dutch games-- they are begging to wear the Dutch dress.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">EADLE</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And that is not the worst of it! On the last Sabbath day, I myself saw some of
									our Puritan boys go forth to join Dutch games. On the Sabbath, mind you-- the S<hi
										rend="sc">ABBATH</hi>!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> W<hi rend="sc">OMAN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>My boy ran away in spite of me.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> W<hi rend="sc">OMAN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Many times I have followed and have brought mine home, but 't is a struggle I'm
									very weary of.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>It hath, indeed, become a grave question-- this bringing up of our children in
									Puritan ways when customs around us are different. That alone would give us reason
									for leaving Holland were there not the other matter.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But, Master, nothing hath really <pb id="VAA9493-118" n="112"/> happened as yet.
									'Tis all conjecture with us. Methinks 't would be unwise to leave Holland till we
									know for a certainty that King James means to oppress us.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> W<hi rend="sc">OMAN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>So it seems to me--</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And to me! To me! To me!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But we cannot combat a danger when it hath overthrown us.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>B<hi rend="sc">RADFORD</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>No, indeed, we cannot.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ARVER</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>We should leave Holland as soon as we can make the necessary arrangements,
									friends. I am convinced of that.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>And I! And I! And I!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>No! No! No!</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>We can scarcely come to a decision so long as we are of such divergent opinions.
									But consider this, my people. The information came to us through Captain Miles
									Standish, who is known to you all as a man of the highest honor.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>But he is not a Puritan.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>He frequently attends our church and is most friendly to us. Besides, being an
									English soldier stationed here in Leyden, he hath unusual means of obtaining
									information. And he hath advised us to leave Holland at once.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>W<hi rend="sc">INSLOW</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>We should listen to Captain Standish, friends. He is not the man to speak
									lightly.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Aye!</p>

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> M<hi rend="sc">AN</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Aye, we must. Mine eyes be opened now.</p>

								<p>Aye! We do! We do!</p>

							<sp>
								<speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OBINSON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>So be it, then,-- we will go. It only remains now for us to put our savings
									together that we may obtain a ship and stores. Then we will again go forth from
									our homes with little save what we can carry in our hands-- just as we did from
									Scrooby. Again we will become Pilgrims, but ever with the same desires-- that we
									may have freedom in our religion, and that our children, and our children's
									children, and their descendants in the years to come, may continue our faith and
									worship in peace and security. My people, let us <pb id="VAA9493-123" n="117"/>
									pray together now that God may bless our new pilgrimage.</p>

							<p>The time hath come, then, to work our plans; that is, if you be still certain of

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I had my information from fishermen who have sailed this way. And each declared the
								country here abounded with gold mines, which we could buy from the savages for a
								string or two of beads.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Perhaps gold mines will be found also to the south in Virginia, whither these
								Puritans are going.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Nay, 't was just here, they said, in exactly this location.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>'T is a thought that dazzles my brain! Gold mines! Why, 't will make us as rich as

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And forget not the wondrous Indian city, with its streets of gold and its jeweled
								towers. The fishermen said it was beautiful beyond anything seen by mortals.</p>
						</sp>
						<pb id="VAA9493-125" n="119"/>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>'T would be pitiful to pass it by. Are the sailors with us?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>To a man. They talk of the gold mines constantly and of the riches they will win.
								It would be hard to persuade them to sail past this point.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>We might land these Puritans here whether they would or no.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>The sailors are urging that, Captain.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But the Puritans are well armed and outnumber our crew.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I believe we can count on certain Puritans themselves, sir.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Why, how is that?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I have just learned, from one of the crew, that there are at least a dozen men here
								pretending to be Puritans who are not such at all. They came aboard at the last
								moment when the ship touched at the English port. And now they are planning to
								overthrow the Puritans as soon as they have landed, and imprison William Brewster
								and the other Puritan elders.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>They were, no doubt, sent by certain enemies of the Puritans in England.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>P<hi rend="sc">ILOT</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>No doubt. But we can count on them, sir. Indeed, I have caused reports of gold to
								be spread secretly among them. And now they be talking among themselves in low tones
								and whispers.</p>

							<p>Then land these Puritans here, Captain. I can complain to them of the shoals to the

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">APTAIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>They could be avoided by sailing out to sea.</p>

							<p>Brothers-- countrymen! We have not forgot it is the Sabbath day, but for once we

								will be in our harbor to-day. Two other such ships will arrive by to-morrow. Is it
								not time then, that we should come to some agreement, despite this holy day?</p>

							<p>Yes-- yes! We should! We should!</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">AMUEL</hi> A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>We must prepare ourselves for action. Long have we talked of this fatal day-- when
								the first tea-ship should come. Many meetings have we held, and this committee
										<stage>(<hi rend="i">indicating <pb id="VAA9493-156" n="150"/> men with
									him</hi>)</stage>, appointed by the Patriots of Boston, has waited again upon
								Governor Hutchinson. And again has his Excellency advised us to receive the tea.</p>
							<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Murmurs of indignation</hi>.)</hi></stage>
							<p>Long ago, when first we knew that a tax had been placed on our tea by King George
								and his obedient Parliament, we declared such a tax unjust to us. But, despite our
								protests, England has not only willfully fixed this tax, but has sent us tea, as if
								she would compel us to take it.</p>
							<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Murmurs of indignation</hi>.)</hi></stage>
							<p>His Majesty evidently does not think we can be in earnest when we say we will not
								pay taxes to the English government unless we can be represented in that government.
								For many years have we petitioned King George to allow us a representative in
								Parliament, but this the king persistently refuses. Indeed, he has openly declared
								that his American subjects shall be taxed at his will, and that they shall have
								nothing to say in regard to their own government.</p>
							<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Murmurs of indignation</hi>.)</hi></stage>
							<p>For many years England has taxed us heavily. Beginning with 1764, we were required
								to pay, yearly, large sums of money into the royal treasury. And that, in spite of
								our enfeebled condition brought upon us by England herself, through the long war she
								waged on this land against her enemy, the <pb id="VAA9493-157" n="151"/> French. You
								know how we came to England's aid in that war. You know how heavily we taxed
								ourselves, and gave men, money, and provisions. One million pounds were given by
								this State alone. And the flower of our youth went forth to their death. Does that
								spell disloyalty to our mother country, friends?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>V<hi rend="sc">OICES</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>No! No!</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">AMUEL</hi> A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>No, we were never disloyal. In deed, I think we pride ourselves on being
								descendants of Englishmen. No one of us forgets that our forefathers were
								Englishmen, and came here to establish English life in the wilderness. We were
								brought up with the love of England in our hearts. And how have we been requited?
								Our free commerce with other lands has been suppressed-- we must now trade only with
								England. Our homes can be entered and searched by her agents at any time, and we
								have no power to prevent it. Our grievances are so many indeed, that I will not
								attempt to repeat them. You know them all too well. Our courteous petitions asking
								for a voice in Parliament have been answered by insulting royal orders. His Majesty,
								who should have been deeply interested in our welfare, commanded us to cease our
								public meetings. We were prohibited even the right of free speech! We-- free men--
								were treated as slaves!</p>
							<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Murmurs of indignation</hi>.)</hi></stage>
							<pb id="VAA9493-158" n="152"/>
							<p>English soldiers were sent here to compel our obedience, and to insult us by their
								presence. They are a constant reminder that we are only hirelings to fill the king's
								treasure box. Why, even the English chimney-sweeps speak of us as "their subjects."
								And now comes this last wrong to us! To be sure the tax is small, and the tea with
								the tax will not cost us as much as we are paying now for the tea we buy from
								Holland. But that is not the question.</p>

								before them. I told them that it was the earnest desire of every Patriot in Boston
								that they resign their office. I asked them, with courtesy, to come here to-day, and
								resign publicly, that our confidence in them might be renewed, and our respect for

							<p>No, no, friends! We cannot compel the consignees to resign through destruction of
								their property. Besides, if we would have the respect of our sister Colonies, we
								must show them that our actions are guided by reason. And it may be that King George
								and his Ministers will realize that we are sober-minded men with whom they cannot
								trifle. Let us concentrate our energy on one thing alone-- a steady determination to
								refuse this tea sent by England. Do you all agree to that?</p>

							<p>No, no, my countrymen, we can no longer hope that resolves, orations, and
								acclamations will vanquish our foes. Did we not resolve, orate, and acclaim in
								former days, when other unjust taxes were put upon us by King George and his
								obedient Parliament? It is true these taxes were finally repealed, but the king will
								not give up his fondest dream-- that of taxing American Colonists. Do not be
								deceived into thinking it is the revenue that the king desires this time. It is not.
								The tax is small and will not yield more than three hundred pounds a year. No, it is
								simply a question of oppression. The king means to show us for once and all that we
								must obey him. Do you hear that word-- you free men of America? Obey! and obey like
								galley slaves chained to their seats, with his royal governors for task-masters. Is
								this to be borne? No! The blood of free-born Englishmen is in our veins. The spirit

							<p>I was, Madam, and I assure you that I would not have missed it for anything. You
								see, Dr. Franklin, as the Colonial agent here in England, had presented to
								Parliament the complaint of Massachusetts against her royal governors, Hutchinson
								and Oliver, and this was the day appointed for discussion of the case. The
								Solicitor-General made a most bitter attack upon Franklin. He insulted him openly

						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> L<hi rend="sc">ADY</hi>.</speaker>

							<p>Two of them did, Madam, <pb id="VAA9493-186" n="180"/> but they were both poor
								speakers and made no impression. Their voices were soon lost in the torrent of abuse
								from the eloquent Solicitor-General, and in the applause of the judges and members,

							<p>Aye, it has come to that. So the time is now ripe to make our secret proposal to
								Dr. Franklin.</p>
						</sp>
						<pb id="VAA9493-190" n="184"/>
						<sp>
							<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">RS</hi> H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It will require skillful handling.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>What do you mean? Does he suspect us?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">RS</hi>. H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Oh, no-- he believes he has been invited here for the sole purpose of playing chess
								with me.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>He has no idea that it was a pre-arranged plan?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">RS</hi>. H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I am positive he has not. Indeed, I flatter myself that I have managed the matter
								very well. Through meeting Dr. Franklin here at my parties, you have been able to
								hold various friendly talks with him and establish yourself in his confidence. He
								admires you, I know.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Then it will seem quite natural that I should ask him to accompany me to America
								and influence his countrymen to obey the king's commands.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">RS</hi>. H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>

						</sp>
						<sp>

							<p>I fear you will have your hands full when it comes to a bribe. Dr. Franklin seems

						</sp>
						<sp>

						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I have just had information that certain <pb id="VAA9493-192" n="186"/> letters
								arrived to-day from America with news of grave importance. But I presume you have
								heard--?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>To what news do you refer?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>To the proposed meeting of a Colonial Congress next month in Philadelphia.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Yes, I have had that news.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Then you know, of course, that the plan originated in the Massachusetts Assembly in
								June, and that it has been taken up with enthusiasm by the other Colonies. In fact,
								they have all held assemblies and elected delegates to this Congress.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>So I was informed, my lord.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Then you must be prepared to agree with me that the time has come for a
								reconciliation.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I agree with you heartily in that, Lord Howe, but I am at a loss to know how peace
								and union can be restored. Various Colonies have sent to his Majesty a respectful
								statement of abuses, and a humble prayer for their redress, but even this, it seems,
								is regarded by the king and his ministers as a form of treason, and is utterly
								ignored.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>His Majesty believes he has the right to govern his subjects as he thinks fit and
								proper.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>His Majesty's subjects in America think it impossible for any man or body of men,
								living so far away, to know their peculiar business and political needs.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But his Majesty has placed royal governors <pb id="VAA9493-193" n="187"/> over
								every Colony. Certainly they should know what are America's needs.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>No, my lord, they do not. They are, with few exceptions, Englishmen, and have come
								to us with that strange idea that seems to prevail over here-- that American
								Colonists are of a lower order of beings and should therefore be treated as slaves.
								And also that we are all knaves, rascals, and out-laws.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi></speaker>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">embarrassed</hi>).</stage>
							<p>I must confess, Dr. Franklin, that that idea does seem to be held by some--</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi></speaker>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">with warmth</hi>).</stage>
							<p>Many of your public men have been in America and know full well the culture and
								elegance of our leading citizens. They know that a large number of them have been
								educated in English colleges, and that our colleges in America are of high standing.
								I cannot understand why the opposite opinion prevails, even in Parliament.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I am sensible, Doctor, that you and your countrymen have been ill treated by
								Parliament. But I can assure you that ample satisfaction will one day or other be
								made you. However, I do not think that it was meant to be personal.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>As to the matter of its being personal, I do not think it worth mentioning. I am
								concerned only with the injuries done my country in the Solicitor's attack.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I believe the violence of his speech was <pb id="VAA9493-194" n="188"/> due to the
								troubles that have arisen over the tea tax. Boston refused to pay it or even receive
								the tea, thus defying his Majesty and Parliament openly. Then the other Colonies
								followed her example. Wherever the tea was sent, it was either destroyed or allowed
								to rot in some warehouse. Naturally, the king and his ministers are indignant.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And my countrymen are indignant-- indignant that Boston is now being punished so
								cruelly. I tell you, my Lord Howe, that the king and his ministers may read the
								temper of the American Colonists in their call for an American Congress. Only
								desperate men would have the courage to formulate such a plan, and only desperate
								men would accept it. They know full well that they may be seized as traitors.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>They do not understand England's motives, Doctor. That is the real basis of their
								discontent.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Have you any plan to propose whereby England's motives can be made clear to us?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Yes, I have such a plan. What do you think of sending some person over to inquire
								into the grievances of America; converse with the leading people, and endeavor, with
								them, to agree upon some means of settling our differences?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>The right person might be of great use in such service.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I have just learned that I am being thought <pb id="VAA9493-195" n="189"/> of as
								this commissioner. But I would not undertake it unless you would consent to
								accompany me, Doctor. Your influence over your people is wonderful. You can, if any
								man can, persuade them to listen to reasonable propositions.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I thank you, my lord, but I wish to know what propositions are intended for
								America. If they are reasonable, I may be able to make them appear such to my
								countrymen. If they are unreasonable, I would not think of undertaking such a
								mission.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I would not expect your assistance without a proper consideration. I am, in fact,
								empowered to make you a firm promise of rewards.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>My lord, drop all thoughts of rewards for me. They would be considered as so many
								bribes to betray the interests of my country, and thus would be destroyed the very
								influence you hope to make use of.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But, my dear Doctor, no one need know of it but ourselves.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I will not accept a reward under any circumstances. Only let me know your
								propositions for America, and if I approve of them, I will be ready to accompany you
								at any time you may appoint.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>First of all-- the tea tax must be paid--</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Your mission to America will be a failure, my lord. My people will pay no more
								taxes until they can have a voice in Parliament.</p>
						</sp>
						<pb id="VAA9493-196" n="190"/>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>You must influence them to give up that idea, Doctor, for the king will never
								consent to it. They must also give up this Continental Congress. The leaders would
								be hung and the lesser members imprisoned.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>First catch your hare to eat him, my lord.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>How can they possibly escape? They will be arrested by the royal governors before
								they can reach Philadelphia.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RANKLIN</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>No man on earth can prevent them from holding this Congress. And if I could, I
								would not-- I am wholly in sympathy with them.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Be careful not to express such sentiments here in England, Doctor. It might be
								construed as treason.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>

							<p>I thank you for the hint, my lord.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">OWE</hi>.</speaker>

								you do not make an attempt to prevent this Congress from meeting.</p>

							<p>Right, my boy, right! The Tories are rich and do not feel the burden of paying the

						</sp>
						<sp>

							<p>I confess I am discouraged, Mr. Shippen. We have formed many plans, but all have

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It seems quite hopeless to me. The delegates have all come, and Congress will
								convene to-morrow.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It is most vexatious. There are more Tories here than in any other part of the

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I can scarcely endure the thought of it. How dare they so defy our king! How dare
								they set up their own Parliament!</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Well, they do dare. Here are those arch traitors, Samuel Adams and John Adams, come
								all the way from Massachusetts. And everywhere <pb id="VAA9493-202" n="196"/> on
								their passage, bells were ringing, cannon firing, and men, women, and children
								crowding to see them as if to a coronation. New York would not let them depart till
								they had devoted six days to the princely entertainments provided for them.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And Philadelphia has been no whit behind in her reception of these rebels. They
								arrived on the twentieth of August, and have been feasted with magnificence ever
								since. Last night a young Quaker and his wife had a costly repast for them. The
								night before, a Roman Catholic. And always toasts are given to the success of the
								Congress.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Their boldness exceeds anything I ever knew, except that of their rebel

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>We should take some bold step ourselves. His Majesty will reward us richly, if we
								succeed in dispersing these delegates.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>How can we accomplish what the royal governors have tried with such ill success?
								The different assemblies, called by the rebels to elect delegates, were ordered to
								dissolve. In Virginia they were especially bold, and met just around the corner.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And in Massachusetts, the governor sent his sheriff to dissolve them, but Samuel
								Adams had locked the door and had put the key in his pocket. The sheriff was not
								even allowed to enter.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And that happened with the British general close by!</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It is strange General Gage did <pb id="VAA9493-203" n="197"/> not arrest this
								Samuel Adams. The king ordered it some time ago.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It is evident he has not dared to. So what can we do, gentlemen? The rebels have
								the populace with them. Let us make one move, and we would soon have a mob upon
								us.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I would not dream of open opposition. But why not kidnap their ringleaders, John
								and Samuel Adams? It could be done by our men to-night. Congress would hardly
								convene without them, or, if it did, it would dissolve in confusion-- so dependent
								are they all upon this brace of Adamses.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>You forget Patrick Henry, of Virginia, sir. He took a prominent part in the
								Virginia Assembly of rebels, and is said to be a marvelous speaker. He could easily
								lead this Congress. And so could Peyton Randolph or Colonel George Washington, also
								delegates from Virginia.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And so could Christopher Gadsden, of South Carolina, James Kinsey, of New Jersey,
								Roger Sherman, of Connecticut, Thomas Mifflin, of Pennsylvania, or Cesar Rodney, of
								Delaware. They are all leaders in their own Colonies.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And so are John Jay, James Duane, and Philip Livingston, of New York, Nathaniel
								Folsom, of New Hampshire, Stephen Hopkins, of Rhode Island, Samuel Chase, of
								Maryland, and William Hooper, of North Carolina. Can we kidnap them all?</p>
						</sp>
						<pb id="VAA9493-204" n="198"/>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I see that my suggestion is futile-- even foolish under the circumstances. We must
								depend upon Tories in Congress.</p>

						<sp>

							<p>Tories in Congress! The delegates all call themselves Patriots.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>True. But some of them will be found to have Tory sympathies, especially men with
								property. They know they will lose their possessions if it comes to war with
								England. For that reason they will be conservative and will hold down such rampant
								rebels as those men from Massachusetts.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I believe you are right, Mr. Shippen. I would not be surprised if Mr. Washington
								were not at heart a Tory. He is one of the richest men in Virginia.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>T<hi rend="sc">HIRD</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I believe we can count also on Mr. Joseph Galloway, a delegate from Pennsylvania.
								He also has large property-holdings and visits Tory families socially.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I know Mr. Galloway very well, so I will talk with him to-morrow. Indeed, we must
								make it our business to talk privately with several delegates and bring every
								influence in our power to bear upon them. We must prevent this Congress from
								declaring its united support of Boston.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But that is the real purpose of its meeting.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I know, but we must find members <pb id="VAA9493-205" n="199"/> who will defeat it.
								We must tell them that such a resolution would mean war with England, and the utter
								confusion of all business here in America. We must frighten these delegates,
								gentlemen, and cause them to see clearly their own financial ruin.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>S<hi rend="sc">ECOND</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It is a good plan, Mr. Shippen, and I believe it will work. Men may rant about
								patriotism, but when it comes to a question of their own possessions, it is a horse
								of another color.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">OURTH</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi></speaker>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">laughing</hi>).</stage>
							<p>Indeed it is! It will make them dissolve in one week.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>F<hi rend="sc">IRST</hi> T<hi rend="sc">ORY</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It certainly cannot last a month. We will need to influence only two or three
								important men, like Washington and Galloway. The timid ones will follow like sheep.
								For there will be timid ones, gentlemen. Even some of the leaders you have just
								mentioned will become confused when faced with the responsibility of bringing a war
								on this country. And these we can rely on to make a unified action impossible.</p>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">Nods and murmurs of consent. First Tory rising</hi>.)</stage>

							<p>I have waited with great patience to hear some resolution which should tend to
								produce harmony between England and the Colonies. But to my mortification and
								distress, a month has been spent in debates on propositions which tend to inflame
								rather than reconcile-- to produce war instead of peace. The motion just read is
								manifestly of that order. It is more-- it is undutiful and illegal. It is an insult
								to Parliament, and it cannot fail to draw on the Colonies the resentment of our
								mother country. If we will not trade with Great Britain, she will not suffer us to
								trade at all. In proof of that, see what has happened in Boston! Her people refused
								to pay the tea tax and destroyed the tea, but her act was resented quickly. Bills
								were passed by Parliament and signed by his Majesty, to curtail <pb id="VAA9493-208"
									n="202"/> the freedom of Boston. And then in enforcement of these new laws,
								battleships were sent to block her port, and four new regiments to patrol her
								streets, and now her business is utterly ruined. Is it then incredible that other
								English men-of-war will block all our other ports, and that other English troops
								will reduce us all to obedience? You know well what that will mean. The produce of
								labor will perish on our hands: labor itself will soon cease, and then will come
								absolute ruin to each and every Colony. I therefore reject this motion as being
								dangerous to the welfare of all our American interests.</p>

							<p>I should like to refresh the memories of the gentlemen who have just spoken. Have
								they forgotten that a state of war already exists in Massachusetts? Why, the war has
								come! It is here in our midst. Our Colonial agent in England, Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
								has done all any mortal man could to plead our cause. But our petitions have either
								been ignored or laughed at. And now our distinguished countryman is himself in
								constant danger of arrest. So why do you say, Mr. Galloway, that you fear a war will
								come? I tell you that it has come! It began when those infamous Bills against the
								liberties of Boston were signed by his Majesty. What, then, are we to do? Shall we
								bow humbly to our royal king while he uses his lash on Boston? Shall we kiss the
								royal mantle while the royal hand aims his cannon at the very hearts of our
								countrymen? No! We will not! We must show that we resent England's policy in this
								land. Therefore has this motion been made, and therefore must it be carried.</p>

							<p>"To the Delegates of the Continental Congress,</p>
							<p>"<hi rend="i">Dear Sirs:</hi> Be it known to you that General Gage is fortifying
								Boston as if we were declared enemies. The entrenchments upon the neck are nearly
								completed. Cannon are mounted at the en- trance of the town. It is reported that
								strong fortifications are to be erected on the surrounding hills, so that these,
								with the ships of war in the harbor, may absolutely command every avenue to the
								town, both by sea and land. When the city is thus <pb id="VAA9493-212" n="206"/>
								enclosed, it is feared the inhabitants will be at the mercy of brutal soldiers, who
								are even now harassing us in many ways. We therefore apply to the Congress for
								advice. If you advise us to leave our homes and abandon the town, we obey. If it is
								judged that, by holding our ground, we can better serve the public cause, we will
								not shrink from hardship and danger.</p>

							<p>Mr. President-- Honorable Members <pb id="VAA9493-213" n="207"/> of Congress. There
								is great suffering in Boston. The new laws passed by Parliament are being enforced
								with rigor. Not a vessel of any kind, is allowed to leave the harbor. Not a pound of
								hay, nor a sheep, nor a chick, can be brought in a boat from the islands. Nor can a
								stick of lumber or any package of merchandise be taken by water-- even from wharf to

							<p>Mr. President, I would call it disobedience. They have declared in a public

								courts of England; that, in case any citizen were so seized, they would seize and
								keep as hostages any of the king's officers who might fall in their way. In fact
								they have refused to obey every one of those bills so lately signed by his Majesty.
								Is that obedience, gentlemen? I call it treason! And yet some of you applaud it!</p>

								have rendered no account. The people rebelled and were shot by the governor's royal

								a long time. They have seized whatever they pleased from unoffending citizens; they
								have fired upon market boats and behaved with unbearable insolence. Massachusetts
								has been oppressed with taxes from which the king's officers were exempted. So it is

							<p>Mr. President, as a matter of fact, Boston has offered to pay for the tea she

								the thing Boston is fighting. If she fails, all America is doomed. Doomed to pay any

								nothing! Even with his forces increased by two thousand men, the brave English Tom
								does nothing. His troops annoy us in many ways, but they do not dare to attack us.
								Why, Gage has not even tried to arrest our Patriot leaders, Samuel Adams and John
								Hancock, whose heads the king has wanted for a year or more. Nor can he make us
								drink any English tea or pay the tax upon it. Nor can he ever make us pay any tax of

							<p>It was indeed a wonderful convention at Cambridge. Every one was full of <pb

								another Continental Congress.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">LARK</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But, Mr. Adams, are you so certain that another Congress can meet ? King George has
								forbidden it.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It will meet despite the king's orders.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>

						</sp>
						<sp>

							<p>But every delegate will be in constant danger of arrest.</p>

							<p>It is more than a year since our first Congress, and no one has been molested.</p>
						</sp>

							<p>The royal governors are finding out that America is a huge country inhabited mostly

							<p>You must confess, gentlemen, that this year conditions are different. Congress
								passed laws that were most obnoxious to England, particularly those forbidding any
								trade with Great Britain. And these laws have been put in force by the other
								Colonies and adhered to by them with such fidelity that England has felt the loss in
								her revenue.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>M<hi rend="sc">RS</hi>. C<hi rend="sc">LARK</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And the royal governors are better prepared to act. More troops have been sent
								over; indeed, there are thousands of British regulars here.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>We have our minutemen, who have <pb id="VAA9493-235" n="229"/> been secretly
								drilled this long time, in anticipation of trouble.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">LARK</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>But they are not as well trained as the regulars who have made a profession of
								warfare. Nor have we any considerable supply of ammunition as yet. You do run a
								great risk, gentlemen.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It is a risk we must take, friends, or this land will never be free from
								oppression. We are all willing to give up our lives.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">ANCOOK</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>That was a settled conviction with us when we first planned to hold a Congress. We
								expected our property to be seized by England's agents, and ourselves to be taken to
								England for trial.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Where they would treat us as criminals and hang us as swiftly as possible. But that

							<p>Now, then, what was that question, Mr. Clark?</p>

						<sp>
							<speaker>O<hi rend="sc">LARK</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>What has become of that Tory who betrayed every secret of the Congress last year? I

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>A<hi rend="sc">DAMS</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>We are expecting him. I hope he will denounce England's unjust treatment of us as

						</sp>
						<sp>

							<p>If he does, he will fan the flame into war. Boston is now a smouldering fire. Any

								<p>I consider that resolution dangerous to the best welfare of this country. If it

								<p>I heard the same questions asked by the same gentleman in Congress last year. "We
									dare not war with England," he cried. "We are far too weak to resist her." And so
									on until he had almost frightened us. But let me ask you, gentlemen, whether
									recent events have proved these things to be true? What happened in Massachusetts
									in the early morning of April 19, 1775? You know that story well. British troops
									shot with deadly aim at our minutemen in Lexington, and soon put them to flight,
									for they were only a hundred and faced one thousand regulars. But soon came
									reinforcements-- <pb id="VAA9493-246" n="240"/> our splendid militia of Patriots.
									They swarmed from every country road-- they seemed to drop from the clouds even.
									The British could not withstand them and retreated in full run to Boston.</p>
								<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Loud applause</hi>.)</hi></stage>
								<p>Then in May came English reinforcements. And in May, also, Congress chose Colonel
									George Washington, of Virginia, as commander-in-chief of our Continental army.
									That was one year ago. Have the events of that time distressed any Patriot as to
									the efficiency of our American troops? General Washington has driven the British
									soldiers from Boston-- from Massachusetts-- from all New England, in fact. They
									have embarked on their ships-of-war and have sailed away to Halifax. Does that
									show weakness, gentlemen? Does that prove our inability to meet the British
									troops?</p>

								<p>Does the honorable delegate from South Carolina think the British will remain in

									agree with Mr. Dickinson that we are far too weak to fight such a powerful enemy.
									We must make peace with England. It will not be difficult. I believe she will show
									us justice if we but yield a little.</p>

								<p>I should like to remind the gentlemen that for ten years we have yielded-- for
									ten years we have whined our petitions at the foot of the throne, to be answered
									only with insolent scorn. Why, then, do these gentlemen hope for a reconciliation?
									Do those recent battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill with their heaps of
									dead Patriots, give them this hope? Does the burning of our coast towns give it?
									Or perhaps they find it in his Majesty's legislation here in this land-- perhaps
									in the cutting-off of our trade with all parts of the world-- or in the seizure of
									our citizens for pretended offenses-- or in the forcing of our citizens, seized
									upon the high seas, to bear arms against their country and to become the
									executioners of their friends and relations. I will cite no more instances. It
									seems that the mere relating of these few would prove them the acts of a tyrant,
									with whom an honorable reconciliation is not possible.</p>

								<p>Gentlemen, in spite of those facts just cited, I believe our petitions will be

									that we have outgrown Colonial conditions, and need special legislation. But the
										<pb id="VAA9493-248" n="242"/> time will come when his Majesty will understand.
									And then will our petitions be answered favorably, and a reconciliation will
									follow. I believe that firmly, gentlemen.</p>

								<p>I hesitate to spoil Mr. Humphreys's childlike faith in his Majesty, but I happen
									to know the king's feeling toward us. I had many conversations with him in London,
									and I assure you, gentlemen, that he will never answer our petitions favorably--
									he will not answer them at all. He looks upon us as rebels who must be severely
									punished. And he will never give in, for it has become a point of pride with him.
									Then, if that were not sufficient reason, there are others which would still make
									peace impossible. It is no secret that certain English lords, who are favorites at
									court, have found all honest resources insufficient to supply their love of
									excessive luxury. They plundered the East and now they have turned to the West and
									have begun to rob us openly. They have seized our estates; they have taken our
									property on the high seas, and Parliament covers their acts by special laws.
									Parliament has even dared to declare that thefts, burnings of houses and towns,
									and murders of innocent people committed by British soldiers, previous to the war,
									were just actions. Why, such acts are contrary to all principles of right, and all
									ideas of justice entertained <pb id="VAA9493-249" n="243"/> heretofore by every
									other nation, savage as well as civilized. Do you, then, desire peace under such
									intolerable conditions? It is impossible, gentlemen, if we be men of honor.</p>

								<p>I question whether any man in this House desires peace so long as our citizens

									by English law to prove their own innocence, but how are they to do this? They are
									removed from their homes, and are taken far away from the witnesses who might be
									able to clear them. Many of these men are poor and unable to employ counsel. But
									they are straightway thrown into prison, and speedily forgotten. Can anything be
									more unjust? It is monstrous! It is infamous I And we will not endure it! Were
									there no other cause for our separation from England, this would be sufficient. No
									man should be declared guilty until his guilt is proven in a fair trial. Until
									then, that man must be held innocent!</p>

								<p>It is greater even than unjust taxation, because it deals directly with the lives

									the hope that some day in the far-off future this infamous law shall be repealed?
									In the meantime American citizens are dying in English cells, miserable and

								<p>I would beg these gentlemen who are trying to thrust independence upon us, to

									know that England will come to our aid. She will furnish her armies, her fleets,
									her supplies and great wealth to protect us from every enemy. Is that nothing,
									gentlemen? Why, it is everything! It is life itself to us! Let her strong arm be
									removed and we would be instantly seized by other nations, and quickly enslaved by
									them. Can there be any choice, gentlemen? Who would not rather yield to England's
									claims-- unjust as some of them are? We cannot expect to have her protection
									without due return on our part. Let us, then, meet her demands. Let us make some
									sacrifice. That is the way to gain peace and everlasting security. That is the way

								<p>I question Mr. Dickinson's idea: that connection with England will bring us peace
									and security. It is far more likely to keep us at war eternally-- and to ruin us
									financially. Europe will never be long at peace; she has too many kingdoms. So
									whenever there is a war between England and any foreign power, that foreign power
									may invade our land as a dependency of England's. And if that does not happen, our
									commerce will go to ruin in any war of Great Britain's, because of our connection
									with her. In fact we gain nothing by submitting to her <pb id="VAA9493-252"

									and form have impressed each one of us deeply. But do not be misled by this, <pb
										id="VAA9493-263" n="257"/> gentlemen. Let not your senses be tricked by its
									musical notes-- let not your ears be soothed by its rhythm. Analyze its
									sentiments. Analyze them coldly. Consider what its adoption would mean! It would
									plunge the people of this land into utter and abject misery. Our towns would be
									burned, our fields laid bare, and we ourselves would be most like to die upon the
									scaffold.</p>

								<stage><hi rend="center">(<hi rend="i">Applause</hi>.)</hi></stage>
								<p>As for the people-- they will not shrink from misery, nor from any sacrifice that

									them fresh hope-- it will inspire them with courage. They will rejoice when they
									hear the glorious news and declare this day blessed. They will set it apart from
									other days, and celebrate it with rejoicing. And when we and they are in our
									graves, this day will be remembered and hailed as the day of all days-- a sacred

								<p>In two days, or less, they would be upon us with all their troops in New Jersey.

								<speaker>W<hi rend="sc">ASHINGTON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>True, we might, General Mercer, <pb id="VAA9493-274" n="268"/> but that would be
									as fatal to our cause as surrender. The people have lost confidence in us. Six
									months ago, after our victory at Boston, they hailed us as their deliverers from
									the hated yoke of England. Now they weep in despair. They have seen us defeated
									time after time by the British. They have seen us retreat from New York and from
									town to town in New Jersey-- ever fleeing before the enemy as if we feared to meet
									them.</p>
							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>K<hi rend="sc">NOX</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>Do they expect our little army of sick and half-starved men to face a powerful

							</sp>
							<sp>
								<speaker>W<hi rend="sc">ASHINGTON</hi>.</speaker>
								<p>They do not understand the conditions, General Knox. The newspapers are full of
									criticisms against me, and Congress, even, asks why we retreat. In vain have I
									explained that we must save what men we have. In vain have I asked for more men.
									They will not enlist-- their former confidence is gone. And until it is restored,
									there will be no more enlistments. So we must attack the enemy, gentlemen, or the
									cause of liberty, which is so dear to us all, is lost and gone forever.</p>

						</sp>
						<sp>

						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMILTON</hi></speaker>
							<stage>(<hi rend="i">hotly</hi>).</stage>
							<p>And how was he to prevent <pb id="VAA9493-286" n="280"/> it? Is he not hampered at
								every step by lack of men and provisions? To be sure, the victory at Trenton raised
								men's hopes for a time, and there were many enlistments. But a few reverses brought

								that for yourself, sir.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">RAIG</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I do, Colonel. I was indignant beyond all words when I found that Congress was

						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMILTON</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Could anything be falser? Splendid condition, indeed! When we came to this camp two

							<p>It was General Washington who planned Gates's campaign in the north. He sent Gates
								his own best troops and officers, and urged men to enlist. And this is the way he is
								rewarded.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">RAIG</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And that is not all, Colonel. General Charles Lee has been complimented by Congress
								and is on his way to Valley Forge.</p>

							<p>What! Charles Lee coming here--! Now does my wrath explode, indeed! Congress knew
								that Charles Lee <pb id="VAA9493-287" n="281"/> failed to appear at Trenton, though
								commanded by General Washington to come.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">RAIG</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>It seems that he pleaded his capture by the British, prior to the fight.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMILTON</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>He allowed himself to be captured! He was three miles away from his men accompanied
								only by an orderly. He hoped to weaken Washington's force and make victory
								impossible. And Gates pleaded ill-health and the General excused him. We found out
								afterwards that he went straight-way to Congress to complain of something or
								other.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">RAIG</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>Gates and Lee are both Englishmen, and are impatient at being outranked by General
								Washington.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMILTON</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>And each one is thirsting for the General's place at the head of the army. That is

							<p>Does General Washington suspect them?</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMILTON</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>If he does he says nothing. But he is very despondent of late. He talks little and
								never smiles. He is weighted down with the grave responsibilities of these sad
								times. He is making a sacrifice of his life and it is n't appreciated.</p>
						</sp>
						<sp>
							<speaker>C<hi rend="sc">RAIG</hi>.</speaker>
							<p>I should think the fact that he pledged his entire estate to pay the soldiers would
								prove his patriotism beyond all doubt.</p>

									the solemn resignation of the commission under which you have led their troops
									through a perilous and doubtful war. Called upon by your country to defend its

									persevered, until these United States, aided by the generous King of France, have
									been enabled to close the war in freedom, safety and independence. And now you
									retire from military command. But the glory of your virtues will not terminate; it
									will continue to remotest ages. We pray to Almighty God to foster your life with
									all his care; to keep your days as happy as they have been illustrious; and to
									finally give you the reward that this world cannot give.</p>

				<p rend="center b">By AUGUSTA STEVENSON</p>

				<p>These books accomplish three important functions:-- first, <hi rend="b">they arouse a
						greater interest in oral reading;</hi> second, <hi rend="b">they develop an expressive
						voice;</hi> and third, <hi rend="b">they give freedom and grace in the bodily attitudes
						and movements</hi> involved in reading and speaking.</p>

				<p><hi rend="b">The use of these books will greatly improve the oral reading in your
						schools.</hi> In these days, when so many books are hastily read in school, there is a
					tendency to sacrifice expression to the mechanics and interpretation of reading. Those
					acquainted with school work know too well the resulting monotonous, indistinct speech and
					the self-conscious, listless attitude which characterize so much of the reading of pupils
					in grades above the third. The dramatic appeal of the stories in this book will cause the
					child to lose himself in the character he is impersonating, and to read with a naturalness
					and expressiveness unknown to him before; and this improvement will be evident in all his
					oral reading and even in his speech.</p>
