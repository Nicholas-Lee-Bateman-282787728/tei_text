                    <p rend="center">Sign of Capricornus (the goat)</p>
                    <p>If you were born during the latter half of December or the earlier half of
                        January you took up the thread of life under the influence of the sign of
                        Capricornus, a dry, dusty sign of the Zodiac.</p>
                    <p>The protégés of Capricornus are cold propositions, calculating and exclusive.
                        They go to the theater alone and never light a cigar if they are with
                        anybody. These <pb id="VAA2450-012" n="[]"/> people come into life with
                        everything all set and are immune from the misery of indecision, never
                        talking over a minute with a book-vender or a life-insurance agent. Their
                        cautious feet convert the very stumbling blocks of life into a beautifully
                        paved thoroughfare, whereby they may win out all the faster.</p>
                    <p>These people often seek distinction in the political world, always warming up
                        with a few drinks before they start out to throw the salve into the middle
                        classes. The more modest among them are content with becoming bankers,
                        copper kings and traction magnates. So cautious are the Capricornus heirs
                        that when they set out to land something they almost appear to stand
                        still.</p>
                    <p>Naturally the women of this sign inherit a tenderer impulse than the men, but
                        even they are never popular at school. In womanhood they stand coldly aloof
                        and are thoroughly despised by clerks, dressmakers and street-car
                        conductors.</p>

                    <p>Procure a box of roach powder from the nearest drug store, being careful to
                        have the druggist guarantee it. Scatter the powder freely in the crevices
                        about the sink and pantry, repeating the dose each day until the powder is
                        all gone. In a few days the roaches will arrive at the conclusion that you
                        are not going to buy any more and will desert the premises.</p>

                    <p>The moon&apos;s motion on her axis, unlike the electric-light plant in a
                        small town, is entirely uniform. Her angular velocity in her orbit, like a
                        vaudeville program, is subject to slight change. The moon&apos;s surface
                        contains about 14,685,000 square miles of good brick land, but no atmosphere
                        and no water. A profound silence reigns over the desolate clay surface
                        sustaining the old theory that no women abide there. A great many people
                        plant garden seeds by the moon, and, in some instances, farmers have plowed
                        by the moon in order to get off the following day to attend the circus.
                        Crocheting by moonlight is extremely injurious to the eyes. There will be an
                        eclipse of the moon at Shelbyville, Ind., May 10, 1908.</p>

                    <p>The Romans got together and dedicated the first month of the year to Janus,
                        the two-faced god. There was some dissatisfaction over the dedication, but
                        it was allowed to stand. Persons born during the latter half of this month
                        or the first half of the next start out handicapped by the influence of
                        Aquarius, and in innumerable instances have become piano tuners. Mozart and
                        Mendelssohn belonged to this sign. Prof. Clem Harner is now a member. Such
                        men attain much, but seldom realize the fulfilment of all their desires
                        because they are disposed to fiddle around and discuss the Panama Canal. An
                        heir of Aquarius finds it much easier to order a blue serge suit than to pay
                        for it. Like <pb id="VAA2450-022" n="[]"/> a turtle, he is impelled to
                        retire within himself through his own sensitive nature when asked to pay a
                        bill. Their swift soaring fancy often ends in their marrying persons of less
                        sympathetic planets with disastrous results, the wife in almost every
                        instance being allowed the custody of the children and the old home on
                        Chestnut street.</p>

                    <p rend="center">The Sign of Pisces (the Fishes)</p>
                    <p>The Romans made the second month of the year sacred to Neptune, a sea-god who
                        was very fond of water&#151;afterward. People born during the latter
                        half of February or the early half of March enter life under the immediate
                        supervision of Pisces, a sort of watery sign that indicates a disposition to
                        own and operate a milk route, serving their customers at three or four
                        o&apos;clock in the morning and awakening everybody in the flat.</p>
                    <p>While not in the dairy business Darwin, Hugo and Chopin happened in under
                        this sign. Though the natural inclination of the Pisces-born is toward the
                        milk business, should their paths lie in less pleasant places, they may
                        achieve a certain amount of success <pb id="VAA2450-032" n="[]"/> in the
                        profession of the law. But they will be many times hungry and discouraged
                        before they can hook up to any coin. The women of this sign delight in
                        Spring&apos;s first tender greens and the pale, faint flushes of waking
                        day. In all probability it was of such women that Cale Fluhart was thinking
                        when he penned the beautiful lines:</p>
                    <lg>
                        <l n="1">She stood beside the depot door,</l>
                        <l n="2">She was waiting with the rest.</l>
                        <l n="3">The June sun played upon her nose.</l>
                        <l n="4">Sweet emotions filled her chest.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <p>Having once overcome their inborn desire to hang around the depot when the
                        trains come in, these women take readily to general housework and become
                        ideal wives and neighbors. The protégés of Pisces are advised to conduct
                        their affairs with as little agitation as possible, never quarreling over a
                        gas bill or arguing with paper-hangers.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The year 1908 comprises the latter part of the 132nd and the beginning of the
                        133rd year of American Independence, a fact almost lost sight of. The first
                        day of January, 1908, is the 2,417,578th day since the beginning of the
                        Julian Period.</p>
                    <p>During the year 1908, as heretofore, there will be several eclipses of the
                        sun and the same number of eclipses of the moon. Some will be visible only
                        in Asia, while others can be seen from any seat in the house. Except in rare
                        instances, chronological eras and cycles will remain unchanged.</p>
                    <p>The winter of 1908 will be marked by violent snowstorms in some sections and
                        rain and sleet in others. Through the literary belt of Indiana there will be
                        the toughest sledding known in years. An unusually large batch of
                        &quot;number two&quot; companies playing New York successes will
                        invade the smaller cities of the Middle West with a scale of prices ranging
                        from thirty-five cents to two dollars. These counterfeits may be detected by
                        the yellow date bill posted across the original star&apos;s name.
                        Vaudeville will remain as popular as ever, and you will laugh at Bryant and
                        Saville just as hard as you did fifty years ago. Every indication points to
                        another successful season of melodrama, and, &quot;The marriage was not
                        a happy one. A separation soon followed. The wife went to London, where,
                        save for a small annuity settled upon her by a great-aunt, she would have
                        died penniless in the streets <pb id="VAA2450-034" n="[]"/> etc.,
                        etc.,&quot; will play havoc with the emotions as of old.</p>
                    <p>The winter of 1908 will be particularly hard on those of us who bought meat
                        and other necessities the preceding summer and fall. The summer season will
                        be pretty much the same old thing, except the strawberry boxes will be
                        smaller and two national political conventions will be held. The Democratic
                        platform will contain the party&apos;s time-honored appeal to the
                        intelligence of the people, while the Republican platform will dwell at
                        great length on our unparalleled prosperity and take the credit for the blue
                        skies, bounteous crops and wise foreign policy.</p>
                    <p>The same splendid scale of wages for circus musicians that has prevailed in
                        the past will continue: plain, twenty dollars per month; fancy, thirty
                        dollars per month&#151;the players assuming all risk and eating on the
                        lot.</p>
                    <p>The summer of 1908 will last far into September, with a little dash of jacket
                        weather here and there in August. A slight decrease in the price of bacon is
                        promised for November, but at that the cost of living will still be several
                        blocks ahead of salaries and wages. From time to time during the month of
                        December the newspapers will publish most valuable suggestions to Christmas
                        shoppers.</p>
                    <p>Blue serge for men&apos;s suitings will hold its own as in former years,
                        the trousers being cut thirty-six at the hips and fifteen at the bottoms,
                        with both side and back pockets. Many new creations for women&apos;s
                        apparel will distinguish the year of 1908, and you will probably see more of
                        them than in any preceding year.</p>
                    <p>Taking it all in all, the year of 1908 will be a hummer in lots of respects,
                        and you will have to scheme around and hustle harder than ever to make any
                        kind of a showing at all.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing much to be said in favor of late plowing. Eminent
                        authorities say that under no circumstances should a farmer plow later than
                        10 o&apos;clock. It keeps the horses up late and the dew rusts the
                        plow.</p>
                    <p>Be very careful about currying favor with a mule.</p>
                    <p>A farmer should never pay less than $7 for a plug hat.</p>
                    <p>When drilling for wheat a farmer should see to it that his horses stand
                        erect, keep perfect step and are provided with both right and left
                        flanks.</p>
                    <p>A farmer should never keep any ink about the house. Only recently a farmer
                        near Roundhead, Ohio, signed away the earnings of a life-time by one stroke
                        of the pen.</p>
                    <p>The farmer is the most independent man in the world. He has all the work he
                        can do and is never troubled with having to set a price on anything he
                        raises. He can farm in any position. If he tires of plowing he can sit down
                        in a rocking chair and husk corn.</p>
                    <p>If a farmer boy shows a disposition to run away and join the regular army

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Aries (the Ram)</p>
                    <p>A tailor is not a tailor who kicks when an alteration is to be made.

                    </p>
                    <p>The Romans dedicated the blustering month of March to Mars, decorating their
                        business houses and homes in his honor on the first day.</p>
                    <p>People born during the latter half of this month or the earlier half of the
                        next begin life&apos;s weary struggle under the influence of the fiery
                        sign of Aries, indicating an overbearing nature and a fast career. These
                        people make their grand entry with a noodle full of fife and drum music that
                        forces them forward to conquer or get a good beating. Once mastering
                        indecision they will bite the hand <pb id="VAA2450-042" n="[]"/> that feeds
                        them rather than lose out on something they are after, often marching to
                        success over their own dead bodies. They are wonderfully generous to
                        themselves and have five or six suits of clothes and no end of neckties. The
                        women of this sign have a positive genius for burning money and not
                        listening to reason. Any attempt at coercion and they will go straight back
                        to their mothers and take the children. The men take readily to politics and
                        often become poll-book holders. Henry Clay, Bismarck and Shakespeare
                        belonged to this sign, but only showed up occasionally when there was an
                        initiation.</p>
                    <p>The Aries born thrive in the southern part of the United States and China,
                        and will have frequent recourse to courts of justice. They waste little time
                        repining over unrequited love, and, as some towns do not have a Sunday
                        closing ordinance, so some Aries love affairs reach a happy consummation.
                        The flower of this storm-tossed, skirt-blowing month is the Amaryllis,
                        signifying a stuck-up disposition and loud hosiery.</p>

                    <p>To be a successful farmer it is by no means necessary to cultivate a big crop
                        of troublesome whiskers. It was shown recently in an article in
                        &quot;Farm Life in the Middle West&quot; that some of our most
                        prominent agriculturists are smooth-faced, while others have just the
                        faintest suggestion of a mustache.</p>
                    <p>In operating a corn shredder a farmer should caution his wife against getting
                        her apron caught in the machinery while he is in town playing pool.</p>

                    <figure entity="VAA2450-19"/>
                    <p>Ex-Editor Cale Fluhart was stole by the Indians just out of Haverhill, Mass.,
                        many years ago at the age of four. He afterwards escaped and wandered
                        through the unbroken wilderness to the home of his parents at Lafayette,
                        Ind. After graduating from Purdue University he went to Pickreltown, Ohio,
                        then a small village, and launched <hi rend="i">The Pilot,</hi> a vigorous
                        publication for &quot;the plain people,&quot; and his fame as a
                        fearless and forcible writer spread rapidly, not only through Logan County,
                        but as far east as Larue. Mr. Fluhart had much to do with the development of
                        the Madriver Valley and the establishment of a post-office at West Liberty.
                        During the memorable campaign of &apos;76 Editor Fluhart&apos;s
                        scorching editorials were read and re-read by dozens of the most prominent
                        farmers, whose productive bottom-land acres stretched from Slaty Hollow to
                        the McKee&apos;s Creek Church. During the strenuous days that followed
                        the counting out of Tilden <hi rend="i">The Pilot</hi> fairly sizzled with
                        hot stuff. One cold, dark night Editor Fluhart slipped out of his home and
                        started by a circuitous route to the grocery to get a can of cove oysters,
                        when some assassin fired <pb id="VAA2450-048" n="[]"/> from ambush and
                        forever stilled his pencil hand with a volley of buckshot. That discouraging
                        episode in the life of Mr. Fluhart ruined his ambition and squashed his
                        brilliant career.</p>
                    <p>Having outlived his usefulness by more than a score of years Mr. Fluhart is
                        still keenly alert, <figure entity="VAA2450-20"/> watching events with all
                        the interest of a man in his prime. He is a daily visitor at the barber
                        shop, and revels among the newspapers and magazines, his journalistic
                        instinct never deserting him.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Taurus (the Bull)</p>
                    <p>The Romans dedicated the month of April to the bright planet, Venus, holding
                        the twenty-third day sacred to her honor. People born between the dates of
                        April 19 and May 20, inclusive, enter life under the guidance of Taurus, a
                        strong, husky sign bequeathing to its protégés all the sterling attributes a
                        newspaper hands to a prominent citizen after he is dead&#151;if he has
                        been a subscriber.</p>
                    <p>These people are the squatty snarled apple-trees of society. They assume
                        Life&apos;s heritage at a time when Tennessee strawberries and long,
                        bright green, tasteless cucumbers invade the markets, and Nature, tired of
                        her mantle of snow and ice, warms up to the situation. The heirs of Taurus
                        have <pb id="VAA2450-052" n="[]"/> self-reliance and buoyancy of spirit, and
                        frequently reach high places&#151;such positions as postmaster and
                        constable. They are seldom talkative and are fond of canned corn. Especially
                        is this true of the men who marry Taurus women, for it matters not how much
                        money he owes, you can never tell it by looking at his wife. As long as he
                        can get credit, her faithful feet will follow. Hers is the devotion of
                        Clytie, who lived just out of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, and became enamored of
                        Helios, a pianola salesman of good address, and followed him to Niles, Ohio,
                        where he died as he had lived&#151;a profligate.</p>
                    <p>Taurus people inherit an excellent physique that endures many years. A
                        well-known and popular Taurus woman is to-day traveling with a burlesque
                        company, posing in <hi rend="i">Rock of Ages</hi> at the age of 79. When
                        Fate directs them toward Italy, Sicily, Northern Spain or Louisville,
                        Kentucky, they lose their buoyancy.</p>

                    <p>The now almost universal custom of moving on the first day of May was first
                        noticeable at Fremont, Ohio, on May first, 1822, and spread rapidly east and
                        then south along what is known as the Cincinnati range of hills. It is due
                        principally to our restless American spirit and poor janitor service. It is
                        getting to be a popular fad among flat owners to insist on tenants signing
                        leases. People have been known to live in the same flat one year, thinking
                        that a lease held them. If a tenant owes seven or eight months&apos;
                        rent and desires to move into a more select neighborhood, a lease will not
                        detain him. In such cases, however, it is well to have the furniture in your
                        wife&apos;s name.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Gemini (the Twins)</p>
                    <p>The old Romans called May the boundary day &apos;twixt the bleak,
                        leafless, coal-buying season and the hot, sweltering months when newspaper
                        circulations dwindle and cheap rates to Niagara Falls prevail. May was
                        dedicated to the Goddess Maia, and the opening of the general Assizes,
                        whatever that means, was fixed for the first day.</p>
                    <p>Persons waking to life the latter half of this month or the earlier half of
                        the next take their inheritance from the sign of Gemini II, which indicates
                        a changeable existence. The Gemini born usually marry at the age of nineteen
                        without a single prospect. They love to sit in a park and look over the
                        daily papers, and read the lavish offers of fifty to one hundred dollars <pb
                            id="VAA2450-064" n="[]"/> a day to bright, hustling young men of
                        character and no capital. During the course of their restless, feverish
                        careers they solicit insurance, collect for instalment houses, work
                        advertising schemes, and finally land square on the hummer. These wayward
                        children of Gemini inherit an extravagant love for sea travel, and often
                        peel potatoes on the steamers that ply between Cleveland and Buffalo.
                        Whatever the country or clime, however, they will be found hanging around
                        the cheap boarding-house districts, impelled hither more on account of
                        hunger than by mere idle amusement. If the protégés of Gemini ever do enter
                        into the competition of the business world, it is best that they shift the
                        undertaking of important affairs as much as possible to the months of July
                        and August, when well-to-do people have gone North to escape the hot weather
                        and there is no one left behind to watch their homes.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Leo (the Lion)</p>
                    <p>July was made sacred to Jupiter Ammon by our old Roman fore-fathers.</p>
                    <p>Persons entering life during the latter half of July or the earlier half of
                        August take their inheritance from the smooth, oily, magnetic Leo, a hot,
                        fast, kaleidoscopic sign governing the heat of life. These people are all
                        right in many respects, and make good, cool-headed janitors if handled with
                        gloves. In their enthusiasm they frame up ideals which they worship
                        illimitably. Their inborn magnetism and quick response to their
                        party&apos;s call have made them formidable factors in politics. William
                        Jennings Bryan might be a protégé of this sign, and, although he was
                        defeated twice, he made <pb id="VAA2450-084" n="[76]"/> many converts by the
                        spell of his presence, and incidentally threw several doubtful states into
                        the lap of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Leo children rebel against any proposition that restricts freedom of action,
                        and prefer to use their own system. If they are wise they will wend their
                        way to the tenth climate and launch their most important undertakings during
                        the first Tuesday in November. The flower of Leo is the morning-glory, which
                        hangs on like a poor relation.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Chairman, Cittofellizens and Members of the Alfalfa Glee Club: Since the
                        memorable convention of 1896, when William Jennings [tumultuous applause]
                        Bryan thrilled the magnificent assemblage with his matchless oratory
                        [deafening applause], the Democratic party has been floundering in the
                        troubled waters of revolt and discord, and oozing further and further from
                        the safe moorings of stability and intellect into the dense thickets of
                        demoralization and deceit. This Chautauqua headliner from Nebraska
                        [unparalleled applause] has beckoned and beckoned until what was once the
                        safest harbor in the world is now a sand-bar, the Democratic party. Since
                        William Jennings Bryan [at this point the applause fairly shook Melodeon
                        Hall, and a tier of improvised seats collapsed, seriously injuring an old
                        lady, who was carried to the livery stable below] entered the councils of
                        the grand old Democratic party we have had to be content with uproarious
                        applause. This perennial candidate [deafening din] speaks in the forenoon at
                        Hurley, Wis-consin, in the afternoon at Tampa, Florida, and in the evening
                        at Bangor, Maine, always on the go, crowding halls and fair grounds at a
                        dollar a throw, while the poor old party of Jefferson dances for liver. Why,
                        friends, think of Jackson, <pb id="VAA2450-086" n="[]"/> Jefferson,
                        scholarly Tilden, Hancock and his military bearing, ponderous Cleveland, and
                        other great leaders of the Democratic party in the past, and then think of
                        the &quot;parader of the Platte.&quot; [At the very mention of the
                        Platte the applause continued at great length.] Why, friends, I remember
                        once of being in Jasonville, this state, where a vast throng had gathered to
                        hear this so-called &quot;peerless&quot; Nebraskan [here the
                        applause was so prolonged and variegated in its nature that Mr. Fluhart
                        kindly consented to quit speaking and Miss Fawn Lippincut recited
                        &quot;The Smoldering Embers of Democracy&quot; in her usual charming
                        manner, duplicating her former successes].</p>

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Virgo (the Virgin)</p>
                    <p>August, the month when Kansas yells for help, was dedicated to Ceres, goddess
                        of corn, by the old-timers.</p>
                    <p>Folks born the latter half of this month or the first two weeks of September
                        belong to the dry food class, and enter upon the stage of life under the
                        sign of Virgo, indicating an inborn aptitude to voice the mind of the public
                        before the public is really aware of the issues. Virgo heirs make great
                        newspaper reporters. Their manner of digging up news is so engaging that
                        their informant does not wake up until the paper has gone to press and the
                        reporter is well on his way to the golf links, chuckling all the while. A
                        Virgo reporter always carries an old <pb id="VAA2450-096" n="[]"/> sleeve to
                        laugh in. Excellent as this investigative turn of mind may be, the protégés
                        of Virgo often get their newspapers in a jam on account of their
                        unconquerable mania for getting all the news, and their editors have to go
                        home in closed carriages for weeks at a time.</p>
                    <p>Next to the love of excitement attending the gathering of sensational news
                        comes the fondness for getting a prominent position on a grand stand or the
                        end of a special car while President Roosevelt shows his teeth and burns
                        Bryan powder. The Virgo women are fond of finery and social distinction, but
                        a little shy when it comes to laying out their husband&apos;s underwear
                        and putting his other shirt where he can find it if he should suddenly
                        receive an assignment to go to French Lick and interview Tom Taggart on the
                        future plans of the Democratic party. Any month in the year will prove
                        congenial for Virgo interests.</p>

                    <p rend="center">Sign of Libra (the Scales)</p>
                    <p>It isn&apos;t quite clear who dedicated September, but those who pick up
                        the thread of life under the influence of the sign of Libra will have a fine
                        liberality of thought and rare good judgment when it comes to picking out a
                        boarding-house or a good nickel cigar.</p>
                    <p>These people, above those of all other signs, seem to get in on all the real
                        bargains of life. Longfellow has said that &quot;in this world every man
                        is an anvil or a hammer.&quot; The Libra fellows fulfil the prophecy of
                        the hammer&#151;all being knockers of a high order of excellence. Born
                        leaders, they are bad losers. Theirs is the power that enables others to
                        sell you shoes that almost kill you, clothes <pb id="VAA2450-106" n="[]"/>
                        that wrinkle across the back, and six-dollar shirts with your monogram
                        worked in the sleeve.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the physique of the Libra protégés is less robust than their
                        mentality, but at that they get the goods. When fate unites them in marriage
                        with an heir of Leo or Sagittarius, it is almost certain to be a blow-off,
                        for these people of the fine triplicity are always kindling something. The
                        women of the Libra sign measure up fairly well, except that they are
                        extravagant, and sometimes contract pecuniary entanglements that keep their
                        husbands&apos; noses in close proximity to the grindstone until
                        overtaken by the grim harvester. The flower of this heaven-kissed month is
                        the poor little violet:</p>

                    <p>The Romans loaned out the threatening month of October on royalty to the red
                        planet Mars, assembling a number of exclusive features and holding a street
                        fair to this god of war on the nineteenth day, called Armilustrium Day.</p>
                    <p>Persons born during the latter half of October or the first half of November
                        draw unto themselves the vibratory influence of the sign of Scorpio,
                        indicating a moody, determined nature that doesn&apos;t overlook any
                        bets. The larger, the more daring the scheme with which these people connect
                        themselves, the <pb id="VAA2450-116" n="[]"/> greater their per cent. They
                        often conceive and manage great charity entertainments and push them to a
                        successful finish without a cent of capital, being content to wait and take
                        four-fifths of the receipts for their services. It matters little what kind
                        of a scheme the Scorpio heirs launch, as long as they stand at the door and
                        handle the money. Theirs is the motto of Lucifer himself: &quot;Better
                        be the whole thing in a town like Urbana, Ohio, than a resident of Newark,
                        New Jersey.&quot; As inconsistent as it may seem, it is not for lack of
                        refinement and gentle blood that the Scorpio born would rather stand and
                        watch the passing throng through the latticed door of a saloon than join in
                        the festivities.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, the women of this sign are a shade better than the men, but they
                        gall under restraint and possess an inborn aversion to anything savoring of
                        housework. The Texas Panhandle or the Ninth District of Pennsylvania or any
                        part of the Third climate are preferable localities for the Scorpio
                        heirs.</p>

                    <p>The Romans dedicated the month of torchlight processions, mud slinging and
                        elections to the bounteous Diana, celebrating the fourteenth day in her
                        honor.</p>
                    <p>People enterin life during the latter half of November or the earlier half of
                        December take their inheritance from the sign Sagittarius, indicating that
                        they will be what is commonly known as &quot;plain spoken&quot;
                        people. The heirs of this sign will be equipped with indomitable energy and
                        a distressing propensity to spread out and do things. This unflagging and
                        persistent activity is generally incomprehensible to the innocent
                        bystanders, and they will gather in little knots in the corridors of the
                        court-house and predict the ultimate failure of such a pace.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2450-126" n="[]"/>
                    <p>The Sagittarius heirs insist that wrongs must be righted as soon as they are
                        discovered; projects must be put through the same day they bob up. Thus they
                        are often intolerant to those who are less practical and executive than
                        themselves. Their impulsive efforts confuse others, and their inclination to
                        be the whole thing renders any concerted movement impossible. They inherit a
                        feverish physical unrest that craves the freedom of space and the
                        intoxication of motion, and they are next to insane on the question of
                        publicity and children. President Roosevelt was probably born under the sign
                        of Sagittarius or in the immediate vicinity.</p>

                    <p rend="center">PSYCHIC PHENOMENA</p>
                    <p>Dream lore is placed under the head of psychic phenomena. The student of
                        present-day psychology and other scientific people are not inclined to give
                        much thought to the varied influences of dreams, yet many instances are
                        shown of prophetic warnings which seem almost incredible.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Sam Rudder, of 11117 South Canal street, Zanesfield, Ohio, dreamed that
                        her husband, who is a Big Four passenger engineer, had arrived safely from
                        his run and stood talking to friends in the roundhouse. She arose and
                        frantically grabbed the telephone. Ordering an automobile, she hurried to
                        the railroad yards, where she found her husband safe and sound.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Hiram Smith, dean of a college at Bloom Center, Ohio, dreamed that he
                        had been attacked by a cat. He called to his wife, who ran to the kitchen to
                        get his revolver, and there discovered the coffee-pot filled with
                        kittens.</p>
                    <p>In a fearful dream two weeks ago, Miss Cyril Jones, whose grandfather is 117
                        years old, was foretold that he could not live much longer. To-day he is
                        confined to his room.&#151;Springfield, Ill., Despatch.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Winifred Conklin, a very wealthy Indianapolis widow, was awakened in her
                        richly furnished flat on October 10, 1906, in a terribly nervous condition.
                        She had dreamed that it was daylight, and that the janitor was scrubbing the
                        marble steps. She rushed madly <pb id="VAA2450-130" n="[]"/> to the window,
                        and the sun was shining brightly, but the janitor had not shown up.</p>
