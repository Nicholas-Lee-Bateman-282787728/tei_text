            <p>It is an interesting paradox that a war of such insignificant proportions as that of 1812 should have
                    produced such controversy concerning its causes. Nineteenth century historians, with a unanimity
                    more characteristic of that century than of this, in general accepted the view that the war was
                    essentially a struggle to defend American neutral rights and the national honor against the
                    aggressions of Great Britain. In the present century this unanimity has been shattered. Historian
                    after historian has placed his own particular interpretation on the events preceding the outbreak of
                    war in June, 1812.</p>
            <p>Of all the works produced during these years, undoubtedly the most influential has been Julius
                    Pratt's Expansionists of 1812, published some thirty years ago.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    Professor Pratt stated in his introduction that he only intended to examine one set of causes of the
                        war,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> but this has not prevented later historians from according the work an
                    importance far out of proportion to this statement. Pratt's main thesis was that a factor
                    of primary significance in the causes of the war was <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. This, he argued, was matched by a southern demand for the Floridas for agrarian,
                    commercial, and strategic reasons. Thus the northern and southern Republicans arrived at an
                    understanding that the acquisition of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> on the north was to be balanced by the annexation of the Floridas on the south.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>Since the publication of Pratt's work in 1925 his ideas have exerted a constant influence
                    upon historians—so much so that two standard works on American diplomatic history, Bemis
                    and Bailey,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> both base their final conclusions regarding the origins of the war
                    on Professor Pratt's thesis. Samuel F. Bemis, after dealing mainly with maritime questions,
                    concludes that the War of 1812 was finally caused by a western expansionist urge rather than solely
                    by the grievances of neutral rights and impressment, and as authority for this statement refers to
                        Pratt.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Thomas A. Bailey, after a more balanced presentation of the origins
                    of the conflict, states that the presence of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> probably tipped the scales in favor of war.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Nevertheless, in spite
                    of these recent acceptances of Pratt's western expansionist theories, his ideas have not
                    gone unchallenged since 1925.</p>
            <p>The most relevant criticisms came in 1931 in two articles by George Rogers Taylor on agricultural
                    conditions in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> in the years preceding the War of 1812.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Taylor argued that the westerners were suffering a commercial depression, and
                    that they had a vital interest in British commercial regulations. He endeavored to show that it was
                    not necessary to seek noncommercial motives to explain the western attitude toward the war. These
                    ideas received remarkably little attention during the remainder of the 1930's, though

            <p>It was not until 1941, with the publication of Warren H. Goodman's article on the
                    historiography of the origins of the war, that it was possible to find conveniently summarized the
                    various conflicting theories which had been advanced by historians.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> In this
                    article, the most significant contribution to the problem in recent years, Goodman surveyed the
                    changing interpretations of the war and reasoned that both the advocates of maritime rights as well
                    as of expansionist theories had been too extreme in their views. In his opinion the importance of
                    the northwestern desire to annex <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> to prevent Indian depredations, and of the southern desire to annex <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>, had been overestimated, and the articles by Taylor on agricultural conditions in the
                        <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> deserved more attention.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Goodman's plea for a more balanced viewpoint has not had any marked effect on historians in
                    the years since 1941. The major contribution of this period has been Alfred L. Burt's study
                    of the relations of Britain, her North American colonies, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> between 1783 and 1818.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Professor Burt in this careful study of
                    the diplomacy of the period returned, in some measure, to a nineteenth century view of the war. He
                    argued that the questions of neutral rights and impressment formed the essence of the conflict, and
                    he rejected Pratt's theories concerning peculiarly western aims. Taylor's opinions
                    regarding the depression in the <geogName>Mississippi Valley</geogName> were not considered in
                    Burt's arguments, though he briefly pointed out the importance of the commercial depression
                    in the southern states in arousing anger against <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Professor Pratt has not allowed the various attacks on his theories to go unchallenged. Both in his
                    1941 review of Burt's volume,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> and in his general history of American
                    foreign policy, published in 1955,<hi rend="sup">16</hi> he restated his opinions concerning the
                    importance of particular western demands. He has not, however, offered anything essentially new,
                    though he now acknowledges that depressed agricultural conditions were a factor in <placeName>

            <p>There still remains therefore considerable divergence on this question of the origins of the War of
                    1812, and of why the West so enthusiastically gave its support to the war measures. The three main
                    streams of opinion, exemplified by the views of Pratt, Taylor, and Burt, in turn show the
                    war-supporters as eager to revenge Indian depredations by the conquest of <placeName>

                    historians in studying this confused topic is either to list divergent reasons for war without any
                    attempt at division into degrees of importance, or to choose one reason and to relegate the others
                    to a position of relative insignificance. Yet, in spite of this confusion, it does seem possible to
                    create some pattern from this jigsaw of neutral rights, agricultural depression, expansionism, and
                    fear of Indian attack, and to assess the relative importance of causes.</p>

                    led historians to seek non-commercial causes for the conflict was that in the vote for war in
                    Congress, the Northeast, the foremost commercial and shipping area, was the section opposed to the
                        conflict.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> This, however, is not a reason for supposing that non-commercial
                    factors were the primary cause of the war. The fact is that the shippers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName>, engaged in an extensive wartime carrying trade, were able, in spite of British
                    restrictions, to make a considerable profit.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> They were quite prepared to
                    condone British practices and oppose war with that country as long as these profits were available.
                    They realized that they had much to lose by war. Abstract questions of neutral rights bore little
                    weight with the commercial New Englander waxing rich in spite of all foreign restrictions.</p>
            <p>The case was much different in the West and South. These areas harbored the producers not the
                    carriers. They were not concerned with the vast profits of the carrying trade but with the more
                    marginal question of selling their produce. The South, it is commonly agreed, depended to a great
                    extent on her export of tobacco and cotton, but in the case of the West there has been disagreement.
                    Writers have, on occasion, taken the view that as the West was in a primitive agricultural state it
                    was not concerned with the matter of exporting its produce.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It is true that
                    the West was not engaged in an extensive overseas export trade, but the fact that its overseas
                    exports were small made it all the more essential that this trade should not be interrupted. The
                    farmer of the West needed purchasing power for his land, for manufactured articles, and for small
                    luxuries in his home and diet.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This fact has been brought out by Taylor in his

            </p>
            <p>The important fact, however, is not that there was a depression but that the westerners attributed
                    this depression to British commercial restrictions. Throughout the debates of the Twelfth Congress
                    in 1811 and 1812 it is apparent that westerners and southerners were convinced that the British were
                    ruining the overseas market. Frequently, in works stressing western expansionist urges as the basic

                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and subdue the Indians. A careful consideration of their speeches in Congress shows,
                    however, that though they spoke with feeling and eloquence of the atrocities of the Indians and of
                    taking <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, the dominating themes of their speeches were the questions of maritime rights,
                    especially the right to export American produce.</p>
            <p>On December 6, 1811, Peter B. Porter opened the debate on the report of the Foreign Relations
                        Committee,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> of which he was chairman. He stated: "The committee
                    thought that the Orders in Council, so far as they go to interrupt our direct trade, that is, the
                    carrying of the productions of this country to a market in the ports of friendly nations, and
                    returning with the proceeds of them—ought to be resisted by war."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> He was maintaining, in no uncertain terms, that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> should fight for the right to sell her produce. His brother War Hawks gave him full
                    support. The greatest War Hawk of them all, Henry Clay, contended that, "to-day we are
                    asserting our right to the direct trade—the right to export our cotton, tobacco, and
                    other domestic produce to market."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Clay was echoing the sentiments of
                    his fellow Kentuckian, Richard M. Johnson, who, as far back as April 16, 1810, had argued that there

            </p>
            <p>The westerners received full support in this connection from their allies of the South, and it would

            <p>There seems little doubt that the West, through its representatives in Congress and on the frontier
                    itself, had a vital interest in its export market, and that it was attributing the loss of this
                    market and the subsequent decline in prices primarily to British commercial restrictions. It is not
                    surprising then that in Congress in 1811 and 1812 the western representatives spoke vigorously of
                    the need to defend American maritime rights—this was not, as the advocates of the
                    expansionist theories would maintain, simply a facade, hiding the real western desire to conquer <placeName>

                    </placeName>; it was a genuine feeling that if the West and South were to have a market for their

                    greater part of the argument of the War Hawks was devoted to attacking British maritime
                    depredations. They had a material interest in doing this, and what is more they had a genuine

                    distress, and they felt anger at all the other British infringements of American rights. Only a

                    </placeName> had struggled for independence against a country which now ignored this new-won
                    freedom. The leaders of these War Hawks were young men who had been raised on the traditions of the
                    War of Independence. The older generation, well represented by <placeName>

                    </placeName>, were "first generation revolutionaries"—men who had
                    gambled for independence, had won, and were in their later years little inclined to risk their

                    </placeName>. Henry Clay and his young allies were the "second generation
                    revolutionaries"—young men who were willing to take chances with the hard-won
                    gains of their parents. They had grown to manhood hearing oft-repeated tales of the War of
                    Independence, but they themselves had long been compelled to suffer without retaliation the constant
                    infringement of American rights. The generation of the War Hawks had come of age during a period in
                    which American seamen were being taken from American ships, and in which Britain had attempted to
                    tell America how and what she should export. It is not surprising that when to these acts was added
                    growing agricultural distress there was an ever-increasing cry for war.</p>
            <p>The report of the Foreign Relations Committee of November 29, 1811,<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    that the time for submission was at an end, objected bitterly to British commercial regulations and
                    to the practice of impressment. It summarized the essential cause of complaint against Great Britain
                    with the argument that the <placeName>

                    lines of reasoning laid down in this report. Their leaders agreed that war was necessary against

                    Orders in Council, illegal blockades, impressment, and the general terms of neutral rights and
                    national honor dominated their arguments. Clay himself stated on December 31, 1811: "What
                    are we not to lose by peace?—commerce, character, a nation's best treasure,
                        honor!"<hi rend="sup">44</hi> Clay's whole argument in this speech was for the

                    questions, and showed a very real awareness of the long years of British depredations upon American
                    commerce.</p>
            <p>Pratt's thesis that a factor of primary importance in producing the war was the desire of

                    notably Louis Hacker in his article on western land hunger, and Burt in his detailed study of this
                    period, have attempted to eliminate the Indian problem as a factor in persuading the westerners to
                    demand war.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> It would seem from the available evidence that these writers are
                    wrong in completely ignoring the Indian factor. Though it seems likely that the dominant motives of
                    the West were related to British maritime actions, the importance, in certain areas, of the fear of
                    British instigation of the Indians should not be underestimated. It seems likely in fact that,
                    particularly after <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>, the suspected British backing of Indian depredations was of definite importance in

            <p>There is no doubt that the presence of hostile Indians on the frontier was of great importance to the
                    westerners. Any careful study of the records of this period inevitably leads one to that conclusion.

            <p>Even more important from the point of view of this study is that there was no doubt in the minds of
                    the settlers that the British were instigating the action of the Indians. On July 31, 1811, the

                    danger from the Indians. The third of these petitions stated: "That we are fully convinced
                    that the formation of this combination headed by the Shawanese prophet, is a British scheme, and
                    that the agents of that power are constantly exciting the Indians to hostility against the <placeName>

                    proves beyond doubt, the late disturbances in the West to be owing to the too successful intrigues
                    of British emissaries with the Indians."52 The encounter at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> on November 7, 1811, crystallized this western sentiment and convinced the settlers
                    that British intrigues were bringing desolation to the frontier. Whatever the British policy was in
                    reality, the American settlers undoubtedly were convinced that it was inciting the Indians to
                    aggressive warfare.</p>
            <p>The fact that the frontiersmen connected the British and the Indians is no reason for supposing that
                    the prevention of this alliance was the <hi rend="i">dominating</hi> motive in the vote of Congress
                    for war in 1812. This view fails to take into consideration several relevant facts. In the first
                    place, the core of the feeling against the Indians was in the exposed northwest
                    frontier—in the Indiana, <placeName>

                    is true, of course, that the anger against the supposed British inciting of the Indians was felt
                    deeply outside the immediately exposed area—<placeName>

                    </placeName>, but the actual vote for war depended on non-frontiersmen. The Indian menace
                    undoubtedly influenced frontier areas, and in some was the dominating factor, but it seems unlikely
                    that the large vote for war in non-frontier areas was inspired by a desire to protect the northwest
                    frontier from Indian depredations. The importance of the argument concerning Indians in the
                    Congressional debates of 1811 and 1812 has been greatly overestimated. British encouragement of the
                    Indians was discussed in the war debates but it was discussed in connection with other factors. A
                    reference to the murderous savages urged on by the British provided a fine emotional climax to any
                    speech, but it would appear that the argument which united the 79 representatives of diverse
                    sections to vote for war was the more generally applicable one of the need to sell produce in order
                    to live.</p>
            <p>Arising out of the Indian problem is the important question of the demand for <placeName>

                    </placeName>. It may well be asked that if the dominant motive for war was not a desire to shatter
                    the Anglo-Indian alliance, how can the fervent demand for the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>

                    considered, of course, that the demand for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> arose from the supposed British instigation of the Indians. This view is worthy of
                    careful consideration. Indeed it appears that in the case of certain areas—particularly
                    the Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> Territories—the desire to quench support for the Indians was probably the
                    dominating wish in the minds of the settlers in 1811 and 1812. Yet, while it is true that much of
                    the debating of the Twelfth Congress was concerned with plans for the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, it would appear that in general these aims were not primarily inspired by a desire to
                    prevent British support of the Indians.</p>
            <p>Burt, in his detailed work on Britain, America, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>, suggests, without detailed elaboration, that the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was anticipated as the seizure of a hostage rather than as the capture of a prize.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> It would seem from the debates in Congress that this was indeed the case. The
                    key fact is that almost exclusively in their speeches the War Hawks first considered the <hi rend="i">reasons</hi> why war was necessary, and dwelt on maritime grievances, and then, when
                    turning to the <hi rend="i">methods</hi> of waging war, discussed the question of invading <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. It is true that the war party saw in the conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> an opportunity to prevent further Indian depredations, but there seems no reason to
                    believe that this was in itself a sufficient reason for the war party to achieve such general
                    support in 1812. The various sections of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were not sufficiently altruistic for the South Atlantic states to demand war and the
                    conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> for the purpose of relieving the Northwest from Indian attacks. Yet, the demand for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> entered into the speeches of the southerners as it did into the speeches of the western
                    War Hawks. Pratt explained this away by contending that there was a sectional bargain, by which the
                    South was to obtain <placeName>

            <p>Calhoun, the young South Carolinian, clearly stated the reasons for southern support of Canadian
                    conquest, and helped to explain the general attitude of the war party, in a speech on December 12,
                    1811. In answering <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s taunt that the Canadas bore no relation to American shipping and maritime
                    rights he stated: "By his system, if you receive a blow on the breast, you dare not return
                    it on the head; you are obliged to measure and return it on the precise point on which it was
                    received. If you do not proceed with mathematical accuracy, it ceases to be just self-defence; it
                    becomes an unprovoked attack."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> This gives the essence of the matter.
                    Once the War Hawks had decided they wanted war, they were obliged to face the problem of where they
                    could injure their mighty foe. At sea it seemed that there was little hope. Britain's vast
                    navy, which had swept <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> from the seas, was to be matched against a handful of American frigates. Apart from the
                    activities of American privateers there seemed little hope of waging effective war against Britain
                    on the sea. The conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> was the obvious, if not the only method of injuring Britain. Clay's speech of
                    February 22, 1810,<hi rend="sup">61</hi> has been quoted as one of the first appeals for the
                    conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>: "The conquest of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> is in your power" are words of joy to the expansionist historian.<hi rend="sup">62</hi> Yet these words were said after Clay had discussed British mercantile
                    spoliations, and after he had stated that as peaceful measures had failed it was time for resistance
                    by the sword. He then tried to convince the weak and vacillating Eleventh Congress that war against
                    Great Britain was practicable, and that injury could be inflicted upon their enemy: "It is
                    said, however, that no object is attainable by war with Great Britain. In its fortunes, we are to
                    estimate not only the benefit to be derived to ourselves, but the injury to be done the enemy. The

                    </placeName> because it was the only certain way they knew of attacking Britain.</p>
            <p>Peaceful restriction had apparently failed and the West and South resolved to fight the British in
                    the only area in which she appeared to be vulnerable, her North American provinces. Perhaps the most
                    adequate summary by a westerner of why the West wanted to fight was that given by Andrew Jackson on
                    March 12, 1812, when, as commander of the militia of the western district of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, he issued a call for volunteers from this area. In this document, if in no other, one
                    would expect to see reflected the ideas and aspirations of the people of the West; a commander
                    calling for volunteers does not use unpopular arguments. Under the heading, "For what are
                    we going to fight?", Jackson wrote these words: "We are going to fight for the

            <p>The coming of war in 1812 was not a sudden event; it was the culmination of a long series of injuries
                    and insults, of checks to American commerce, and of the infringement of American rights. The <placeName>

                    </placeName>, repeatedly attempted to defend her rights by peaceful economic coercion. Yet, almost
                    inevitably, a breaking point was reached. The time came when, with national honor at its lowest ebb,
                    and large sections of agricultural America suffering depression, any war seemed preferable to a
                    dishonorable and unprofitable peace. The young War Hawks who urged war in 1811 and 1812 had grown up
                    in this atmosphere of the oppression of American rights, and with apparently nothing to gain by
                    peace, urged America to fight for the right to exist as a fully independent nation. Considering the
                    period through which they had grown to manhood, it is not surprising that they demanded war to
                    preserve American commerce, neutral rights, and honor, and that, in order to revenge themselves upon
                    their enemy, they proposed the invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. The suspected British instigation of the Indians was an added irritant, but if Great
                    Britain had pursued a conciliatory maritime policy towards the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, it seems extremely unlikely that there would have been war between the two countries.
                    The fundamental cause of the War of 1812 was the British maritime policy which hurt both the
                    national pride and the commerce of the <placeName>

            <p>The odd combination of the dapper, pious southerner and the careless, heretical westerner often
                    puzzled audiences. Mark Twain was indubitably amusing. Once characterized as having "the

                    Congo and French set to wild melodies," and it paid customary homage to
                    "Mary's Night Ride," which "fairly electrified the

            <p>Perhaps it is not surprising that the forthright Mark Twain expressed irritation over this romantic
                    tale of the brave southern woman and infant riding through the Confederate lines in the night. As
                    its narration grew steadily longer, he grumbled that "there has been a thundering sight too
                        much"<hi rend="sup">22</hi> of Cable on the program. To his notebook he confided:
                    "Cable costs me $550 to $600 a week—that is,
                    $450 a week &amp; expenses. He is not worth the half of it."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Twelve years later he was still sufficiently annoyed to enter another note:
                    "George W. Cable always stole 2/3 of the platform-time when we were out

                    the che-ild!"<hi rend="sup">25</hi>—became in the Clemens household a stock

                    </placeName> papers treated Cable politely, but Mark Twain was the lion of the occasion, even though
                    the <hi rend="i">Times</hi> critic said that "the first few sentences … uttered
                    in his drawling devil-may-care way, caused an inward fear to creep through the minds of many
                    … that it was their fate to be bored."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> That fear soon
                    vanished. The Tribune said that Twain won approval the moment he "sauntered upon the stage
                    in his easy careless manner, with a grave look upon his countenance." Merely
                    "glancing sidewise at the audience" produced "a general outburst of
                    laughter," and passages from <hi rend="i">Huckleberry Finn</hi> "kept his
                    listeners in a roar … all through." The reviewer described this laugh-provoking
                    man: "His appearance … is directly the opposite of Cable's. Tall,
                    somewhat angular, with a shock of grizzly hair covering a large head, a smoothly shaven face, with
                    the exception of a gray and stubby mustache under a large Roman nose, and over a wide ranging mouth,
                    with a voice low and gutteral [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] … a … solemn look
                    … upon his features, he is the embodiment of all that is droll… . The witty

                    because of "the patience or lack of it of the audience." This dryly humorous

            <p>The one good part of his performance was "Mary's Night Ride," which the

            <p>On the other hand, said the Courier, trying to praise Mark Twain was "like gilding refined

            <p>If Cable ever saw that harsh review, he did not publicize his feeling about it. As a modest man who
                    had less self-confidence than his overpowering companion, and who was willing to play second fiddle
                    in this company of two, he did not quarrel with critics. Mark Twain was different. If he believed
                    that he had done poorly, he did not object to censure, but unfair criticism made him bristle, and he
                    had been known to write a warm rejoinder. Yet he could not complain of the effusive favor showered
                    upon him in Indiana. At one point in the tour, however, he lamented his success as a funny man by
                    bursting out: "Oh, Cable, I am demeaning myself. I am allowing myself to be a mere buffoon.
                    It's ghastly. I can't endure it any longer."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
                    Nevertheless, he consciously worked upon the humorous effects of manner and speech with studied art,
                    and he was chagrined if he could not rouse a glum audience to laughter. Of his performance in

               </placeName>, for instance, he remarked that he enjoyed lecturing to
                    southern people because "they laugh themselves all to pieces… . It is a great
                    delight to talk to such folks."43 Mark Twain was a man of perplexing paradoxes.</p>

                    standby, "Mary's Night Ride." The Twain readings were all new: the story
                    of Tom and Huck aiding Jim to escape, Baker's bluejay yarn, the tale of Tom Quartz, the
                    Nevada duel, the burlesque encounter with an interviewer, and others.</p>
            <p>A return engagement after only a month lessened the freshness and originality apparent in January.
                    The audience was not so large this time, and only the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> printed a review.
                    The evening was "most enjoyable," it said, "and if … less full
                    of zest than the previous one, it was because the novelty had somewhat worn away … not
                    that the performance was below standard. The general verdict was expressed by a fair auditor in the
                    gallery, who, while Mr. Twain was telling of his duel, gave a long-protracted half-musical shriek,
                    dying away in a hysteria and a rupture of whalebone."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If less numerous than the January turnout, this one was evidently as responsive. Some citizens might
                    have been indignant, however, had they known that two days later Mark Twain casually referred to the
                    Hoosier capital as "a little place like <placeName>

                    "I have learned my trade at last," he wrote to Livy. "I know how to read
                    my stuff. At last I can stand on a platform &amp; do the thing right. I did make 'em
                    shout last night."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> As a speaker he was a craftsman, continually
                    learning his "trade" and setting up for himself exacting criteria.</p>

                    yards,"48 Mark Twain said. Then they went on to their final engagements in eastern cities,

            <p>Comparatively few pioneers of the Middle West left significant accounts of the stirring events
                    through which they lived. So engrossed were they in establishing the material and cultural
                    foundations of the region that they had little time for recording their experiences and
                    observations.</p>
            <p>Cyrus Nutt relates that he was born in a log cabin on a farm near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Southington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1814.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> When only four he attended the district school and at
                    fifteen he taught such a school. Determined to secure an education, he spent two terms at a
                    Presbyterian academy at nearby West Farmington.</p>
            <p>Though his autobiography lacks clues regarding any serious vices or misdeeds, Cyrus Nutt states that
                    he was a wild and rude boy preoccupied with follies. As a youth he considered the possibility of
                    becoming a minister, but he had a difficult inner struggle before his conversion at a Methodist camp
                    meeting. He was not ordained a minister until 1840, but his conversion preceded his college career.</p>
            <p>Apparently in 1833 he entered Allegheny College, at <placeName>

                    1836 and immediately became a teacher in the Preparatory Department. The following year he accepted
                    an appointment in the Preparatory Department of Indiana Asbury University which the Methodists were

            <p>He taught at Asbury from 1837 until 1843, returning to the faculty again in 1846 after holding

                    </placeName>, 1850-1855. These colleges were likewise sponsored by the Methodists. From 1855 until
                    1857 he was presiding elder of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> district. In 1857 he again rejoined the Asbury faculty and remained until 1860, serving
                    as acting president for the last two years. In 1860 Thomas Bowman was selected the new president of
                    Asbury and Cyrus Nutt became president of Indiana University where he served until his resignation
                    in 1875. When he died that same year after a brief illness, Indiana lost a devoted teacher, an
                    experienced college and university administrator, a servant of Methodism, and a Christian gentleman.</p>
            <p>The autobiography was begun in 1853 when Nutt was president at Whitewater College and was finished in
                    1856 when he was presiding elder of the <placeName>

                    Most of it, however, relates the beginnings at Asbury with emphasis on its financial problems and
                    brief, exciting glimpses of student life and faculty relations. His account closes with an
                    evaluation of Bishop Matthew Simpson which mingles commendation with harsh criticism.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The autobiography was presented to the Archives of DePauw University and Indiana

                    For the sake of accuracy the unstandardized spellings, common in documents of Nutt's day,
                    have been reproduced. Although the meaning is usually clear, the informal style in which Nutt wrote
                    resulted in numerous omissions of words and letters and occasional repetitions. These have been left

                        </placeName>, on the 4th of Sept. 1814. My Father James Nutt was a native of Blanford Mass. His
                        father having died while he was young, has Mother married again, and at an early period he was
                        thrown upon his own resources, without a permanent home. He had several Brothers and sisters;
                        only two of his brothers was it ever my privilege to see. All of his family except himself and
                        his youngest brother Married and settled in the East but afterwords moved to the west. Tradition

                        to the West in the year 1803, or 4, at about the age of twenty, in company with his Uncle, and
                        Settled in <placeName>

                        him a farm. There labored to that degree that he broke down, and injured permanently a
                        constitution remarkably good.</p>
                    <p>He soon after married a in Southing Township Trumbull Co. <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName>, a young lady by the name of Mary Viets. This marriage took place about the A.D.
                        1806. At the solicitation of his father-in-law, He removed to southington and settled on a piece
                        of land adjoining the farm of his father in-law. Here he lived until the close of his life. He
                        died at the age of fifty four.</p>
                    <p>I was the second of the living sons, and the fourth child of my parents. I was born in a log
                        cabin, in that early day there were scarcely any other kind of dwelings in the country. This
                        one, of which are my earliest recollections of home, was of a peculiar construction. Most of the
                        Cabins of that period were made of round logs this, of my father, was made of very large and
                        long rails. The oak timber being excelent and easily split, Logs some twenty feet long, were <pb n="32" id="VAA4025-053-1-036"/> split into some five or six pieces, and these pieces were
                        laid up with the corners notched down, and the spaces between, were filled chinking and mud. The
                        roof and doors, were made of clapboards, or as they were called by the settlers shingles, The
                        same material constituted the ceiling. The joists were round poles, and the clapboards were laid
                        upon them. The floor was made of puncheons, that is slabs from three to four inches thick and
                        smooth on the uper side and then fitted down upon the sleepers. This formed a very substantial
                        floor. The vast forrests of that part of the Western Reserve, were dotted here and there with
                        log cabins, surrounded by little opens which enlarged from year to year as the owners were
                        enabled to clear off the timber, which was remarkably heavy. It required a life-time nearly for
                        one man to make a farm. On now passing through the well settled and carefully cultivate countys,
                        could scarsely imagine, how different was it is appearance at this early period. This region was
                        occupied mostly by settlers from the <placeName>
                            <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                        </placeName> States, and they brought with then their love of education and their enterprize.
                        Consequently soon, the log school house went up, and the teacher employed, and the children were
                        sent to school. According the custom of the neighborhood I was sent to school, when but four
                        years of age. I have a distinct recolection of this my first school, as well as several events,
                        which transpired previous to this. My father taught me my letters when I was only three years of
                        age. I reccollect as distinctly as if had occurred but yesterday, being out with my father, and
                        elder Brother, as he was chopping down a tree, and as the tree was large it required sometime,
                        and my Brother, with a hatchet of which he was fond and do not know but proud, with myself were
                        wandering through the bushes hacking the saplins, until the tree was near falling, when my
                        father called us to him. As we were coming the tree cracked and began to fall in the opposite
                        direction from what was intended. My brother ran forward to my father, but I got entangled in
                        the brush and falling limbs and sat down, The tree, which was two feet and a half in diameter,
                        fell close by my side, and a large limb just before me, and brush all around, so that it
                        required some little effort on the part of my father to extricate me which with the greatest
                        alarm, and I remember his expression of joy when he found I was unharmed. It was one of those
                            <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-053-1-037"/> wonderful escapes which run little less than miraculous.
                        There are a number of other incidents which occurred in my third year, one of which was the
                        death of my next younger brother. They carried him in their arms in the evening while he
                        appeared in the greatest distress until I went to sleep and in the morning they told me that he
                        was dead. The little coffin was brought, and the pale beautiful babe was put in it, wrapped in
                        the white shroud. A number of the neighbors came, and they carried to a rising ground, and
                        burried him there The appearace of the fresh grave is still fresh in my recollection. I
                        frequently dreamed that my little brother was alive again, and came and played with me. How
                        bright and active he seemed!</p>
                    <p>From the humble cottage I went to meeting and to school. The first school House which I saw was
                        of logs hewed on the inside outside, about twenty feet square, here also the meetings were held.
                        On Sunday at eleven prayer meetings were held, and afterward the class met. Sometimes there was
                        preaching by some local preacher who came from a distance, and held a two-days meeting. Circuit
                        preaching was held generally on a week day, once in four weeks. I remember no incidents worthy
                        of notice which transpired during my subsequent childhood and youth, except what is common those
                        reared in similar obscurity. They said that I was quick to learn, and had a good memory, and was
                        rather abitious to be always at the head of my classes. My first teacher was a young lady, of
                        very even temper rather good natured. She kept constantly by her, however a beech switch of
                        considerable length and magnitude though I believe she used it but one or twice during the
                        quarter. She use to be quite fond of siesta after dinner, and she would recline with the bible
                        for her pillow upon a bench telling some of the larger girls to wake her up when the found the
                        hands of a watch which was suspended in the roon, were at certain points These instructions were
                        not always most scrupulously obeyed, for I remember that we had more than one long
                        "noon-spell," and the mistress would wake up, and seem in great hurry for a
                        few minutes, and loud reproofs were administered to the delinquents, who were perfectly willing
                        that she should have her nap out.</p>
                    <p>When I was five years of age, we moved into a new house on another part of the farm. It was of
                        hewed logs <pb n="34" id="VAA4025-053-1-038"/> twentfour feet square, and well put up, and with
                        a plank floor matched down and the same kind of floor over head. Abut a good a house as could be
                        found in the neighborhood at that time. The plank were put down without planing but they soon
                        were worn smooth Such as carpets were not dreamed of at that time, and indeed were unknown for
                        many years afterward. In this house we three rooms, a kitchen sitting-room and parlor alogether,
                        a bedroom &amp; a pantry, on the first floor, and up stairs all in one. He we lived until I
                        left home to go to College; and my father died, nearly nineteen years. Our family circle was
                        unbroken, consist of five Children, a sister Susan and a brother, Chauncey older than myself,
                        and Isaac and Laura younger. How are we scattered now! Most of us in the spirit land.</p>
                    <p>I was a wild, rude boy fond of fun. Though I recollect once under a sermon from a young man who
                        had been sent on the circuit I think his name was summerville, I was deeply convicted for sin
                        and the tears flowed freely and promised God, that I would be a better boy, but the conviction
                        soon wore off and I becames as careless as ever.</p>
                    <p>As I advanced in years, I gathered the elements of an English Education, by attending part of
                        during the winters a common school which was generally kept during the three winter months. I
                        thus learned to read spell write, and some little smattering of Arithmetic, Geography and
                        Grammar were not then taught in the common schools of that country. I consequence of my devotion
                        to study my father bough me an abridgement of Websters dictionary, an arithmetic, and a
                        Geography and Kirkhams English Grammar then lately published. These sciences I dug out mostly by
                        myself, while resting at noon and night, of the days that were spent in hard labor upon the
                        farm. By devoting these odd spells, in one summer, when thirteen years of age, I
                        "ciphered" through Cruikshonks Arithmetic alone, get help of my father in
                        reference two sums, one in simple subtraction and another in what was then called the
                        "Rule of Three.</p>
                    <p>My father was a very good schollar all the elementary English branches, except Grammar, and
                        taught the District school several winters. He was also the first and only Justice of the Peace
                        for that township for twenty one years, being elected every three years. I used to my books
                        frequently into the field, and while resting I would look over the pages. <pb n="35" id="VAA4025-053-1-039"/> Thus I studied Geography, while making rails, and obtained my first
                        insight into the mysteries of English grammar while plowing corn. Books were a greater rarity
                        then than in this Book making age. My Father's library consisted of the Bible Hymn Book
                        and Discipline of the M. E. Church, and the Statutes of the State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                        </placeName> and an old Almanac or two all told, Our school books not included. To these a few
                        additions were made from time to time. The life of Rev. Free-born Garretson, and an abridgement
                        of Locke's conduct of the human undestanding we purchase when I was nearly grown. When
                        I was fourteen, I labored for some of our neighbors for a week, our own harvest having been
                        finished, for which I received four dollars, the most of which immediately invested in books.
                        Some perhaps may be curious to know in what my first investment in the book line consisted. They
                        were four small volumes, "Thinks I to myself," "Mason's
                        Self-Knowledge," and Pope's translation of Homer's Illiad"
                        in two volumes These I read over several times I was particularly delighted with Homer, which I
                        literally devoured the whole of which I read, in less than two days; though engaged in labor on
                        the farm through the day. I derived great benefit from Mason's self-knowledge, and I
                        suppose no book except the Bible exerted as much influence in the formation of my character for
                        life.</p>
                    <p>At the age of fifteen, I was employed in Teaching a District school, in the town of Bristol, for
                        three months in winter of 1829 and 1830. Had a large school of more than thirty scholars, many
                        of them older and larger than myself. However I got along for the most part very pleasantly and
                        profitably. I taught again in the winter of 1832, in an old and popular neighborhood viz. on the
                        Ridge in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Braceville</settlement>
                        </placeName>, The Pupils were farther advanced here, and it required more skill both in Teaching
                        and governing, than my previous school. I finished up my quarter however to the satisfaction of
                        the patrons</p>
                    <p>During the following sumer I imbibed the notion of going to College, and obtaining a thorough
                        education. This would then appear almost a Quixotic undertaking to most persons, in situation,
                        being without means, and having no wealthy relatives on whom I could rely. The facilities for
                        the education of poor young men were then by no means equal to what they now are. Academies were
                        very and Colleges <pb n="36" id="VAA4025-053-1-040"/> expensive, and encouragement to individual
                        enterprize much less than now. My father had considerable means, but it consisted in wild land,
                        which at that time was entirely unavailable—as it could not be converted into ready
                        means without a ruinious sacrifice. His farm with the moderate culture which we bestowed barely
                        furnished a suport for the family; and reliance upon paternal resources was out of the question.
                        Reliance upon my own resources was the only hope of success. How this strange fancy arose and
                        was developed, may be proper to sketch for the encouragement of poor young men who may be
                        thirsting for knowledge. During the summer of 1832 a farmer moved into the neighborhood and
                        settled on adjoining farm, whose brother, a Presbyterian clergyman, by his death had left him a
                        large library to which, by the kindness of the owner, I had access. This was a privilege duly
                        appreciate, and well improved. Among other volumes, I read Rollin's Ancient History. In
                        this edition, notes from the authorities, in Latin and Greek, were printed. These I could not
                        read, and was often bothered, as I had been able to understand all hitherto, and, it did not
                        suit so well to be baffled in my search for knowledge; and in my heart I resolved that I would
                        master the difficulties, and read the original This resolution was strengthened by reading an
                        abridgement of "Blair's lectures on Rhetoric, in the beauty and sublimity, of
                        Homer was duly appreciated, with the comment that the original was much more so than the
                        translation.</p>
                    <p>One of the volumes of Rollin was in my hand one day, when my father approached me remarking that,
                        "If I would be a good boy, he would give me a piece of land which he had purchased but
                        a short time before, and very temptingly situated adjoining his own farm. My reply was that,
                        "I would prefer an education to any thing else that he could give me. "Why,
                        what," said he, "would you do with an education if you had one."
                        "I do not know," said I, but I would like to know what is to be
                        known." Said father "Should you spend a great deal of time and money, in
                        acquiring an education, I doubt whether, you would have energy enough to use it or not, and
                        probably it would do little good. However, if you are determined on going to school I can
                        probably give you, your time, and that is about all that I can do for you." My mind was
                        fully made up, I had fixed my eye on the summit of the <pb n="37" id="VAA4025-053-1-041"/> hill
                        of science, and charmed with its splendors, no difficulties could deter me from attempting its
                        rugged steeps. Ten acres of new ground were cleared and fensed during that summer and sowed in
                        wheat in the fall, and a full share of the labor requisite for its accomplishment upon me. In
                        consideration of my labor my father paid my bording at an accademy two months that fall. This
                            academy<hi rend="sup">4</hi> was put up by the Presbyterians of West Farmington, of which
                        the Rev. Mr. [Daniel?] Miller had charge, a most excellent and kind man. So about the middle of
                        September my father accompanied me to the seat of science, and introduced me to the Teacher,
                        making this very encouraging remark, He had brough his son, who wished to go to school. He could
                        try him, if he found that the boy could not learn, send him home. The arrangements were soon
                        made and I was duly installed in my quarters, with Adam's Latin Grammar in my hands. I
                        had previously become pretty thoroughly versed in the common, english branches; and now it was
                        with feelings peculiarly joyful that I gazed at the threshold of the ancient languages. Feeling
                        somewhat piqued at the remark of my father to the Teacher, and stimulated by an indomitable
                        resolution to succeed, very few idle moments were spent. Five hours was the average time devote
                        to sleep out of the twenty four. In five days the Grammar was recited through, from beginning to
                        end, and for a few days I was put upon reading the Corderi, conversations in Latin. Virgil was
                        then put into my hands, and the Enead begun. Here progress for the first day or two was slow but
                        in four weeks, I was examined in a class that had been studying Latin a year. In six weeks I
                        could read and translate a hundred lines a day, and passe very well, so that the teacher
                        requested me to instruct his son in the mysteries of Latin Syntax, He was about my age, and had
                        been devoting his attention that science for a year. The first two books of the Enead were
                        mastered in eight weeks.</p>
                    <p>By this time my funds were exhausted, and time for which my boarding bill was paid, was up.
                        During the last week of the quarter, A gentlemen by the name of Fansler, from Bristol arrived
                        inquiring for a School Teacher for Bristol Centre. The Principal refered him to me, and an <list type="footnotes">

                        Books of the Enead were read during the winter. My salary was sufficient to repair my ward-robe,
                        and pay my Tuition another term at the Academy, and pay my boarding for about one half of that
                        term. Ten days after the close of my school elapsed before the commencement of the spring term,
                        which time was spent in visiting my home and friends. Returning to the seminary at the beginning
                        of the spring term, an arrangement was made, to pay a part of my boarding in work, so that I
                        could spend the whole term in school. During this Quarter I read the sixth seventh &amp;
                        eighth, Books of the Enead, and the Teacher put me upon the study of Greek. Valpy's
                        Greek grammar was rcited through twice in eight days, and in eight weeks from the time I began
                        the Greek, I had read the Gospels in the Greek Testament. At the close of the Term I was again
                        without means. The Session closed about the 20th of June. I went home and went to work on the
                        Farm. The first essay at labor after nine months respite, was in the meadow, with a sythe. I was
                        a very warm day, and the grass heavy, and just before dinner, faint, and weary, it began to turn
                        dark. The fence which was near became my support for a few minutes I recovered, the darkness
                        passed, and by being a little more I continued through the day. The next morning found me
                        remarkably stiff and sore. It soon passed off, and in a few days I could work with any of them I
                        continued to work with my father until the middle of September. The fall works was done,
                        harvests secured, and Wheat sewed, and I began to make arrangements for College. At the close of
                        the Term of the Academy, The Teacher said that I was ready to enter the Freshmen class in
                        College, and that I had better go to an institution of that grade. The nearest College to my
                        fathers residence, was the Western Reserve <pb n="39" id="VAA4025-053-1-043"/> College,<hi rend="sup">5</hi> which had been founded a few years previous At its head, as president, was
                        Rev. Mr. [Charles Backus] Storrs, D. D. who shortly after died in consequence as was supposed of

                    <p>A visit was made by my father to Hudson, the seat of this institution, from which he brought back
                        a Catalogue, which was the first that met my view. It contained the names of the students,
                        Course of study, and rules and regulations of the Institution. I ran over its pages with much
                        eagerness; and dreamed at nights of being seated among the pupils in Chapel of the College, and
                        admitted to recitations among the classes. This was the all absorbing thought of my life; to
                        attend College, and yet possessed of no means of paying my way. There was a manual labor
                        department connected with this institution It consisted of a Mechanics shop where several
                        branches of work were carried on, where a young man who had learned a trade, might by two hours
                        labor a day pay his way. This arrangement would have suited me admirably, had I been a mechanic.
                        But I was acquainted with no labor but that of farming.</p>
                    <p>About this time I attended a Campmeeting at Ellsworth some twenty miles from my fathers, at this
                        Campmeeting, the Rev. Joseph [S.] Barrass [Barris], of the <placeName>

                        Allegheny College, at Meadville, Penn. he preached upon the subject of Education, protrayed the
                        facilities for poor young men seeking an education at that Institution, and enlarged upon the
                        advantages of a thorough Collegiate training both to the individual and the community. He
                        remarked that the Trustees had just secured a farm of upwards of fifty acres on which poor young
                        men might labor and thence derive the means of support while attending College. As I had no
                        means, and was acquainted with no trade, I concluded that this was the place for me. So after
                        the fall work was done, the crop in, and arrangements for winter were made, in consideration of
                        the work which I had performed through the Summer, Father took me and my scanty ward, robe and

                        but four students besides myself, Ira Brunson, son of Alfred Brunson, who was then presiding

                    <p>Before I proceed to my adventures at College, perhaps a word in refference to the history of this

                        traveled extensively soliciting funds to erect buildings, and books for a Library. The Edifice

                    <p>The Professor of Mathematics, Rev. H. J. Clark welcomed me to the institution, exhibiting much
                        kindness. There was no place in the town of Meadville, where I could get boarding for mere
                        manual labor. The advantage of being a tradesman was then manifest. As there was a young man by
                        the name of Burton, who entered the College the same week obtained part of the price of his
                        boarding by labor in a wagonshop. I was not prepared for any business except that of farming.
                        Upon inquiry a place was obtained with a man who lived a mile and a half from the College in a
                        very retired spot, where I engaged my board at a dollar and a half per week, and was to pay by
                        chopping cord-wood at the rate of twenty five cents per cord—That is, six cords per
                        week for board, and to walk a mile and a half, were the most favorable terms on which I could
                        commence College life. This plantation was owned by a man of the name of Doughty an excentric
                        individual, who possessed both talent and erudition, and commence life prosperously, but being
                        crossed in love matters he had lived a hermit's life for many years, in this retired
                        spot. He had however married in later years and had a very kind lady for his companion and two
                        children. I stoped at this place not quite a week, when on my way to College with my Books, a
                        gentleman driving a load of wood to town accosted me, in a very friendly manner, and informed me
                        that a friend of his by the name of Worter, who kept a public one mile from the village, and
                        about on half that distance from the institution would furnish me board for about two hours work
                        during the day. that is, "for doing the chores," in the parlance of the people
                        of that neighborhood. A trensfer of lodgings accordingly took place, and I was soon comfortably
                        esconced at Mr. Worters. Here times moved swimingly, for a little more than four weeks, the
                        little jobs of labor occupied my attention only about two hours each day, and the rest of the
                        time was diligently appropriated to study. At the close of the period above named, <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-053-1-046"/> the Nephew of my kind host arrived from <placeName>

                        </placeName>, a poor young man purposing to attend College, and thus he filled my place, which
                        left me without a home. While I was here another misfortune crossed my path, the little cash
                        remaing was stolen, and without a cent, and without acquaintances my condition was by no means
                        enviable. I had felt when my father left to return, that peculiar sensation and depression
                        called, "homesickness." This had nearly worn off, but now returned, with
                        double force. My thoughts reverted frequently to home and its comforts and endearments and I
                        concluded that I had not started to go to College, I would be content to stay at home and
                        cultivate the land which father had offered. But the Rubicon was passed, and I could not bear
                        the thought of making a failure. To leave the recitations of the College was now absolutely
                        necessary, at least for a time. I must have some money, and therfore labored for my landlord a
                        week A friend of mine, with whom I had been associated at the Academy in Farmington, came to see
                        me in the time of deepest mental depression. He was employed by the Presiding Elder on <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Cambridge</settlement>
                        </placeName> Circuit which adjoined Meadville. In that dark and lonly hour, his visit took me by
                        surprise, and afforded me great relief. He voluntarily offered look out for a school within the
                        bounds of the Circuit and write at the end of the week. So on Saturday I received a note from
                        him, that I come immediately to the flats of Le Boeuff, Creek, twenty miles up French Creek, the
                        spot where, the youthful <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                        </placeName> met the French officer and delivered the despatches from Gov. [Robert] Denwidie
                        [Dinwiddie]. He a school could be had which might be taught for four months, at fourteen dollars
                        a month. This brought relief in my perplexity, and my resolution was at once taken. On the
                        following Monday morning I tied up my cloaths in a pocket-kerchief and started on foot to walk
                        to the place designated, I had only thirty seven and a half cents. It had snowed the day before
                        on unfrozen ground, and it was then misting, and thawing which rendered the walking very
                        laborious and difficult. Just as the sun went down on the evening of the twelveth of Nov. 1833,
                        I crossed the bridge over French Creek, and entered upon the Flats Le Boeuff. Sol, which had
                        been hidden all day, show out brilliantly for a few moments just before he sunk below the
                        horizon, It presented a cheering contrast to the gloom of the day, as it <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-053-1-047"/> painted the landscape in golden tints, affording the rich hues of
                        autum. It seemed a good omen, and I felt encouraged. Having advanced about a mile farther on the
                        road to <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Waterford</settlement>
                        </placeName>. I called at the House designated by my friend Dillon Prosar [Prosser]. Very kind
                        was the welcome with which I was greeted by that warm hearted man and Christian, Bro. John Ford.
                        My wants were all carefully provided for, and I soon felt quite at home. I went early to rest
                        after my weary days journey, and slept until awaked by the call to breakfast the next morning.
                        The morning found the neighborhood in great alarm, in consequence of that wonderfull shower of
                            meteors<hi rend="sup">8</hi> which fell all over North America. Many were much alarmed,
                        believing that the Last day had come, and that the general Judgement was about to set, as the
                        stars seemed really falling from heaven. Bro. Ford in the morning, visited the householders, in
                        the district and they were to hold a meeting that night, which it was expected that I should and
                        stand an examination upon the Branches that were to be taught in the school. Three of their
                        number were appointed as examiners, who passed me through Geography, Grammar, Arithmetic,
                        Reading, Writing, and autography They thought that I would answer their purpose so far as

                        doubt whether I had brass enough to govern the school as it was to consist for the most part of
                        youth who were grown. They gave me a trial however, but could not agree to give me more than

                        graduate of West Point, had offered to teach for that price, and as his father lived in the
                        neighborhood and was one of the patrons of the school, it would not do to give the stranger
                        striplin a higher price. The agreement was made and the school commenced. I taught missing no

                                was excited by the brilliant meteoric display of Nov. 13, 1833. This shower of fire can
                                never be forgotten by those who witnessed it. As early as 10 o'clock on the

                                From 2 to 6 o'clock the numbers were so great as to defy all efforts at

                        none attended but what could read. This together with the kindness of the community rendered it
                        one of the most agreeable winters that I ever spent. On the last day of the Term I was taken
                        very pleasantly by surprise, as we had a kind examination the patrons of the school came in, and
                        settled up their bills and one of the leading men by the name of Smith, proposed that as I had
                        been a faithful Teacher, My salary should be made up to fourteen dollars a month, which was
                        readily assented to, and the money paid down with the exception of one dollar, due from a
                        gentleman who was absent from home at whose house I was to call and get it the next morning.
                        This was the only case in which an entire school Bill was met in my experience. Thus I was
                        provided with funds to defray my expenses for some time longer at College.</p>
                    <p rend="center">Chapter. II<lb/> Religious Experience</p>
                    <p>During the winter of 1833 and 1834, I joind the M.E. Church on trial as seeker of religion. It
                        may be as well perhaps here to insert an account of my religious training and conversion to God.
                        My Mother was raised a baptist, my father a presbyterian, though neither of them belong to the
                        Church of their fathers. When they came to the west, they found the Methodists here, who had
                        kept pace with the frontier settlements Here they joied the Society soon after they were married
                        and professed religion. From my ealiest recollection, I was taught the great principles of
                        Christian doctrine and my obligations to God and eternity I was taken to Church by my parents,
                        when very small, the preaching the singing and revival scenes are among my earliest
                        recollections. My Mother used to take me sometimes to her closet, and laying her hand upon my
                        head plead for the mercy of Heaven upon her little boy. This impression is the dearest and most
                        enduring. Scarse a day passes even now, but that beautiful image, and those sweet tones of my
                        Mother recur with increasing freshness to my memory. Long Since she has gone to the repose of
                        the saints, but a holy influence, as if her prayers were still dily answered, seems still shed
                        around me; and my faith is strong that soon I shall meet her, in the bloom of immortal youth,
                        where the word farewell will never be pronounced.</p>
                    <pb n="45" id="VAA4025-053-1-049"/>
                    <p>For a time, though enjoying statedly the means of grace, I was unfortunately drawn in careless
                        society, and joined in the inconsiderate follies of my youthful associates. In the midst of my
                        gayety, I was often seriously impressed, and felt the utter insufficiency of all earthly
                        pleasures. I soon perceived the superiority of intellect and the high order of pleasures, which
                        the understanding affords, compared will all the gratifications of sense. I directed my puruit
                        of happiness in that direction, and resolved to cultivate my intellectual powers. Soon I found,
                        however that the immortal spirit required something more—that nothing short of
                        immortality would prove effectual. When in my seventeeth year, I was deeply convicted of sin,
                        under the preach of the Gospel, and could not refrain from tears, but the sermon closed, and the
                        impression gradually subsided. In August 1833, I accompanied my cousin Chester Morrison to a
                        Cammeeting. He had been licensed to preach as a local preacher a short time before, a paid a
                        visit to my father on his way and invited me to go with him. We arrived on friday, The
                        Campmeeting was just beginning, and the people were full of zeal and hope, looking for a rival
                        (revival?]. Friday evening and Saturday morning passed without any thing remarkable, save the
                        the increase of religious interest In the afternoon, my thoughts were peculiarly exercised. The
                        people were praying with great fervency and power in the altar and some of the tents and souls
                        were being converted and loud shouts of praise were going up, which echoed through the grove.
                        The noise commingled, presented a stange scene of confusion, wildness, and extravagance It
                        seemed as if they must be deranged, and that they were indulging in the extreme of wilde
                        delusion and folly. I felt provoked and angered at their ardor and labor as it appeared to me
                        without any object or reason. I was standing against a tree a little distance from the altar
                        wondering at the singular spectacle of a company of reasonable beings, making themselves
                        extremely ridiculous. While standing there my Cousin came and and kinkly inquired, what I
                        thought of these things, I immediately unbosomed my heart, and told him frankly all that I
                        thought. In reply, he said it was the temptation of the Devil, that presented the scene in such
                        a light. He suggested that it was not worth while to argue the truth of Christianity then, as
                        the whole might be satisfactorily in short metre, by testing the matter <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-053-1-050"/> for myself. By seeking religion in the manner prescribed by the
                        gospel, by repentance and faith in Christ, I would experience its truth or falsity, and if found
                        to be truth, it was the most important truth that the world has even known, and if found to be
                        false, the discovery would be of the highest benefit; besides there could result no harm from
                        the trial. This suggestion seemed reasonable, and I assented to its correctness, and promised to
                        make the trial that night. This led me to think upon the gospel plan of salvation, the goodness
                        of God the wickness and depravity of my own heart; and ere the sun went down I was deeply
                        penitent. When the time for evening preaching came, I took my seat in the altar, in order that I
                        might be better situated to carry out my resolution. Before the sermon was over I was desolved
                        with weeping. Bro. [D.] Goddard whom I had often heard preach before of whose talents I had not
                        the highest opinion, held forth, in a plane, simple Gospel sermon which went to my heart the
                        great deep of was broken up and I was ready to cry out for mercy. At the close, an invita- was
                        given for mourners to come to the altar. Among the first I was down upon my knees praying for
                        pardon and deliverance. It was midnight when the exercises closed, and the mourners were taken
                        to the tents. At the one to which I was taken, the prayer meeting continued some two hours
                        longer; yet I found no relief. In the morning as I awoke, I was severely tempted in a manner
                        which seemed overwhelming. The onset of the adversary was most furious and for a moment I sunk
                        under it. It was suggested at the moment of awaking. "Now you have made a fool of
                        yourself. You have been at the altar, and professed to be seeking the favor of God. Your are
                        ruined!" I tried to look to God in prayer, and the assault was over and the tempter
                        gone, and a sweet calm and peace filled my mind. About nine o'clock on Sabbath Morning
                        I retired to the grove and kneeled at the foot of sugar tree, the voice of singing and prayer
                        could be heard from the ground, and the woods was echoing with the praises of the great Jehovah.
                        After earnestly wrestling in prayer for more than half an hour, light and joy broke into my soul
                        I was astonished at myself, at my feelings toward the world of mankind. I had before felt that I
                        cared but little for others, and thought that none cared for me. All around the world was cold
                        and selfish. But 0! how changed now. I loved every one, Not one of the human family were there
                        but I could have taken them in <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-053-1-051"/> my arms. I had not an enemy
                        in the world. All the material world seemed new and joyful. The sun shone brighter than ever I
                        had seen it before, the grove was more delightful—the birds sang more sweetly, the
                        breezes were more bland, and all nature was filled with the glory of God. A happy frame of mind
                        continued with me. Yet I could not believe that it was religion. Though I loved God and my
                        neighbor-My heart was filled with love. I was invited to join the Church. But I wanted the
                        internal witness that I was a child of God. I had resolved not to unite with the people of God
                        until I had experienced religion.</p>
                    <p>My happy state of mind continued for weeks and months during which time I was careful not to
                        indulge in any known sin, and attended faithfully to private prayer. I was a constant attendant
                        on the means of grace, so far as I was permitted, I enjoyed preaching and prayer meetings, and
                        at every opportunity went to the altar as a seeker of religion. I had much consolation in my
                        lonely hours, among strangers when I entered College and during those seasons of trial after
                        losing my money, and had no home. I dreamed one night that I was under the necessity of crossing
                        a chasm of immense depth, into which if I fell, it was certain death, and the only means of
                        crossing, was to walk a grape-vine stretched over it. I hesitated long but some one seemed to
                        say that there was no danger. I at length made the trial, and when in the middle, the vine
                        broke, I was lost! No I was safe on the other side. The Saviour's hand was extended and
                        bore me gently and safely across. Oh! how happy I was at that moment. I awoke and found joy of
                        soul, and peace like a river! Yet strangely I continued to seek religion, and it was not till
                        some six months after I joined the M. E. Church at <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Waterford</settlement>
                        </placeName>, at a two days meeting held by Joseph Barris who was then agent for the College.
                        Bro Dillon Prosor was present as the junior preacher on the Circuit, and to him I gave my hand.
                        On the first Monday of May 1834 I returned to College, and a class of young men, members of the
                        church, was formed, and in listening to the experience of others my own was expressed, and my
                        faith took hold, and I was unspeakably happy trusting that my sins were all forgiven, and that I
                        was a child of the kingdom. I was soon after appointed leader of the class, which post I held
                        until I left to teach the Seminary in <placeName>

                    <p>When quite a boy, the impression came frequently and suddenly, that I should one day be a
                        preacher. I would strive quickly to banish the thought, but still it would return. I felt that
                        it was too high and holy a calling for so poor and ignorant creature as I was. When I started to
                        College I had no profession in view. My preferances were for the study of Law. But as my
                        connection with the halls of learning was approaching disolution, the importance of selecting a
                        profession was pressed more urgently upon my thoughts. All worldly interests were on the side of
                        the law, but then I was not my own,—I belonged to God who had so mercifully preserved
                        me and crowned my feeble efforts for the acquisition of knowledge with unexpected and undeserved
                        success. As preacher of the Gospel of the ever Blessed God, I felt that I should be more useful
                        to the Church and mankind. But by the practice of Law the path seemed open to wealth influence
                        and renown whereas poverty, contempt, sacrifizes, toils and persecutions were awaiting the
                        humble minister of Christ. The struggle was severe and long before I could say, "Here
                        am I, Send me." I found that I was losing my spiritual enjoyment, while I was trying
                        reconcile my mind to another calling; and distress was heaped upon me. Whichever way I turned,
                        the cross seemed to stand before me, and I felt that wo was me if preach not the Gospel of
                        Christ. At length after long prayer, in which I made it a special subject of intersession, that
                        I might have grace to know and do the will of God. I was enable to lay myself on the altar of
                        the Church of God, a Sacrifize never to be removed. I consecrated myself my soul and body time
                        and talents my all to him who purchased me, "not with corruptible things such silver
                        and gold, but by the most precious blood of his son!" Then peace like a river broke in
                        to my soul, and I could feel that the hymn was realized in my poor heart.</p>
                    <p>"The day glides sweetly o'er my head, "Made up of innocence and love;
                        "While soft and silent as the shades, "The nightly minutes gently

                    <p>After a visit to my home during the months of March &amp; April of the spring of 1834, I
                        returned to College on the first monday of May. I found upon entering that I was in advance <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-053-1-053"/> of the class, with which I had recited during the proceeding
                        fall. During the four weeks, that I had recited, the preceeding fall, I read Romans and first
                        and second Corrinthians in the Greek Testament Virgils Bucolics and Georgics, and the first book
                        of Euclid's geometry. While teaching, I finished the Graeca Minora, and the first five
                        books in Geometry and made some advancement in Algebra. I had no means sufficient for one Term
                        of five months College life. I pursued the usual course of study, attended with about the usual
                        incidents and ecitements common to students.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the summer Term my means being exhausted it became necessary, to find some mode
                        of gaining a supply. Through the interest of Friends, Dr. Ruter, Alfred Bransons then presiding
                        Elder on the Meadville District, the Academy at Frankling, the County seat of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Venango County</region>

                        about twenty dollars a month, which sustained me a year longer at the University which time was
                        diligently improved. I then lacked only one Term of graduating. In addition to the regular
                        studies, I paid attention to French and Hebrew, and could read each of them with considerable
                        facility. Borrowing fifty dollars of my brother I returned to the College after a visit to my
                        friends, about the first of may 1836. I boarded this Term with Prof. H. J. Clark, and derived
                        great advantage from his conversations.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the foregoing spring Term, the two Literary Societies had a contest or a joint
                        exhibition. These were called the Alegheny, and the Philo Franklin; of the latter I was a
                        member. The performances consisted, of Declamations, Essays, Original Orations, and a
                        Discussion. Each society selected a person for each of the above. Five judges were selected, two
                        chosen by each society, and these four were to select the fifth or umpire, and this board were
                        to decide which was the best. I had the honor upon this occasion to represent my society in the
                            Debate<hi rend="sup">9</hi> which was considered the most important. My competitor, was
                        Lewis H. Burton, whose elder Brother, William was then a member of <list type="footnotes">

                                it is thought that the topic of debate was: "Would it be good policy for the
                                nations of Europe immediately to abolish regal government and establish
                                Republics?" Letter from Stanley S. Swartley to Eleanore Cammack, October 16,

                        by the decision of the Board of Judges, but I consoled myself by the thought that they were but
                        fallible, and still concluded that I had made the best effort. Some of my friends suggested that
                        my competitor hare poweful connexions, and that my effort would have been an honor to any of the
                        sages in congress. This was doubtless by way of consolation. There was one the brightest
                        ornaments at the Institution, by the name of Brown, who also was defeated, the son of a Widow.
                        He never returned to College, and it was supposed in consequence of mortification. He went to <placeName>

                        seriously, but entered upon the last Term of Scholastic life with as good Courage as ever. Being
                        the only graduate I as a matter of course had the first honors, and delivered as my graduating
                        speech the valedictory. The Valedictory over the The degree of Bachelor of Arts was confered, by
                        Dr Ruter, and the Diploma present on 22d September 1836.</p>
                    <p>The Trustees had the kindness to appoint me to the Preceptorship in the Preparatory department on
                        the same day. Thus from the time I started to go to the Academy in Farmington four years had
                        elapsed and I was a regular Alumnus of Allegheny College which I am still proud to call my Alma
                        Mater. I had furnished all my own expenses and passed the regular course of Study, and was only
                        fifty dollars in debt. I attended the Academy five moths and the College two years, the rest of
                        the time, eighteen months was spent in teaching. To do this perseverance and effort were
                        requisite. For the most of that time I retired at 11 at night and arose at 4 in the moring.
                        Study was my business. I scarely permitted any other thought to intrude except religion. For
                        months seventeen hours a day were spent over my books. Had I not been furnish with a
                        constitution naturally strong, my health must have failed, and my life been sacrifised. Through
                        the blessing of God I was preserved. I had not an hour's sickness through this whole
                        period; and though engaged in mental toil so severe, I was comfortable and happy.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the winter Term, I took charge of the classes in the Preparatory
                        Department; still pursuing my studies with the same ardour as before I graduated. <pb n="51" id="VAA4025-053-1-055"/> Thus commence my connection with Colleges as a Professor, which
                        continued with one interuption of three years until the summer of 1855, a period of nineteen

                        of May I started for my new home in the west. We had no Rail Roads then, and traveling was slow
                        and tedeous. The first part of the trip was performed by Stage Coach, from Meadville to <placeName>

                        </placeName>, ninety miles. This was a rough and fatiguing journey, traveling all night over
                        muddy roads, on the next day about two oclock down the beautiful valley of the Allegheny River
                        arose a dark cloud of smoke, and we were informed that there stood the renowned city of

                        been in a large City, and every thing I saw a lion [alien?]. The first place I visited was the
                        recevoir, an elvation from which the whole city and its suburbs could be seen. I was out until a
                        late hour "seeing sights," and came very near falling into the hands of the
                        watch as I had lost my way. At length I found my back to the Hotel, and retired at about twelve
                        o clock. The ratling of the drays, and the cry of Watchman, "alls well" kept
                        me from sleep almost all the remainder of the night I found a boat the next morning which was

                        was particularly backward in recommending his own claims. In an other respect, the usages
                        materially differed. It was expected of every candidate for office that he should take the stump
                        and canvass the district or county and openly electioneer for himself. This seemed to me
                        especially strange; for I had never heard a stump speech until I came to Indiana. That a
                        candidate should electioneer for himself would have been regarded at that period, as an
                        unpardonable offense.</p>

                        I must try. I plead to be excused but it was of no avail. Preach I must. I ascended the pulpit
                        with quaking heart and trembling limbs, after the preliminary services, I gave out for a text,
                        the Text. "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation." I enlarged
                        upon the subject of salvation with more liberty than I had anticipated, and retured to my

                        proceeded to the Metropolis, and were kindly received and entertained by Bro. J. Wilkins. The
                        morning of the 4th was taken up in celebration of the sunday Schools. The convention met at two
                        o clock and was very poorly attended, only some half a dozen ministers being present. A plan was
                        agreed upon, which was to present the claims of the University in all the Congregations and
                        subscriptions taken, and that the names be transcribed into a Register prepared for that
                        purpose, together with the amounts which each give, and that this Book should be laid up in the
                        archives of the University, that it might be known to subsequent generations, who were the
                        benefactors of the University. The convention, at least, was a splendid failure, the amount
                        however thus obtained was quite respectable. In the evening, M. Simpson was announced for a
                        sermon. A large congregation was in attendance to hear the new president. The President preached
                        a very plain, fair discourse, but not remarkable for brilliancy or power. He indeed felt that it
                        was a failure, and the great men, of the Conference who had manifested a disposition to treat us
                        a little cavalierly, as imported teachers, were more distant on the next day than ever. These
                        were some of the aspiring young men, who were jealous of strangers and that the professorships
                        should be filled by men taken from the conference. Among the most rampant of these was Wm. M.

                        remedy for youth, but none for age." This prejudice was however entirely swept away, at
                        least so far as President Simpson was concerned, by a very happy effort whi he made at the
                        ensuing Conference at Lawrenceburgh He was appointed to preach the Centenary Sermon before the
                        Conference, and in his effort he was fortunately most triumphant. The Conference took him in

                        was not so necessary for the good of the institution. From that time, it was not long before the

                        commencement I was sent for, and requested to be present at the meeting of the Board. When I
                        entered I found E. R. Ames and Dr. Simpson present, and a proposition to place me in the chair
                        of mathematics, and Weakly in that of Languages. I found that it was expected of me, to bear
                        testimony to the incompetency of Weakly and withdraw my name as a candidate for the mathematical
                        chair In the case of Weakly, his incompetency was a matter of complaint among the best portion
                        of students; but he was notwithstanding very popular with that class, who were disposed to
                        neglect their duties and to indulge in mischief. The Trustees by motion requested Dr. S. and
                        myself to state what we knew about the incompetency of Weakly, when the Dr. arose and stated the
                        complaints of the students and that he was almost invariably the advocate of the delinquent
                        students, and hinted that it would be difficult to mentain the proper discipline among the
                        students while he was connected with the Institution. With the complaints of the students I was
                        familiar, and advised the Doctor to see Weakly and tell him plainly what the Difficulty was and
                        let him take himself out of the way. A resolution was then introduced, declaring his seat
                        vacant, but it was suggested that a milder course would be better, and Rev. James L. Thompson
                        was appointed a committee to request him to resign.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> Which he did in

                        would take that of Natural science. So I withdrew my name, and the Professor was elected and

                        was kept so, and rendered it a little more desirable on that account, otherwise it was a matter
                        of indifference. I continued in my professorship until the fall of 1843, when I resigned and

                        engaged, yet I consented to remain connected with institutions of Learning for fifteen years.
                        But it was at the call of the Church. Because my brethren thought that I could be more useful to
                        the cause of God in that capacity than in any other. I have seen a great many revivals among
                        young men and young ladies at College, who are some of them missionaries in foreign climes, and
                        many on the walls of Zion in different Conferences. But I must say that I am happier in my
                        present field of labor, than I ever was as a professor or President.</p>

                        or the bantling would soon perish for the want of support. In the first there were the twenty

                        plan on which they operated was the sale of limited scholarships; for three years, at fifty
                        dollars—for six years at one hundred dollars. These agents succeeded in in raising
                        some ten thousand dollars, taking notes for scholarships, payable in four equal annual
                        instalments.</p>
                    <p>During this year, as has been indicated, the Prepartory Department was opened, and the Salary of
                        the Teacher was fixed at four hundred dollars. Tuition was fixed at eight dollars in that
                        department, and ten dollars a session in the College Department, and one dollar for
                        Janitor's fees. There were then ordained that there should be two sessions in the year,
                        One Commencing, the first monday in November, and continuing twenty one weeks, the second
                        beginning the first monday of May and continuing the same number of weeks. The vacations
                        embraced the months of April and October.</p>
                    <p>At the next conference, four agents were appointed. S. C. Cooper Wm. M. Daily, Wm. Shanks, and
                        Za[chariah]. Games. They operated efficiently on the same plan that was adopted the previous
                        year. About forty thousand dollars on paper were raised this year. Besides a noble proposition
                        from E. R. Ames, to be one of ten who would subscribe a thousand dollars each, to endow the
                        professorship of Mathematics, which should be called the Ames Professorship. This proposition
                        was soon filled. At the close of this year, all the agents were discontinued, except S. C.
                        Cooper, who made a very efficient agent, indeed the best that the University ever had. He was
                        authorized to collect the dues, as well as to obtain new subscritions. The available means of
                        the University went on increasing at the rate of from seven to ten thousand dollars per annum.</p>
                    <p>The demands upon the treasury were constantly increasing. The College edifice, which was to be
                        one hundred feet in length by fifty in breadth, and three stories high besides the Atic, was in
                        progress. The workman must be paid and the subscriptions in town for this purpose were met
                        slowly and sometimes reluctantly. Some totaly refused to pay, until they were sued, believing
                        that that the subscription was not collectable in law. One or two cases settled this question in
                        favor of the university. The moneys paid on scholarship notes, was used in part for the erection
                        of the building, with the expectation of replaing it, when the building fund should be
                        collected. The collaps in the financial affairs of the Country, which will <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-053-1-069"/> long be many soon after set in, and increased the embarassment.
                        Collections, though the agent did all that any man could do were small. The fact was, that the
                        money was not in the Country. The workmen were paid in College Warrants; and these were sold at
                        a discount for the means of sustenance, and the credit of the institution sank under the
                        presure.</p>
                    <p>The Faculty were sufferes also in these hard times. The first four months the salary of the
                        Preceptor of the preparatory Department was two hundred dollars. Then he was appointed Prof. of
                        Languages with a salary of five hundred per annum. Prof. J. W. Weakly was appoint in the spring
                        of 1838, to serve as Preceptor of the Preparatory Department, with a salary of four hundred, per
                        annum; that made the clain nine hundred dolars for that year. The next, Pres. Simpson was added,
                        and his salary fixed at nine hundred, and mine as professor of languages was increased a hundred
                        dollars as was Weakly's also Making two thousand for Professors' Salaries.
                        From this time till the fall of 1843, the teachers were paid in College warrants. Frequently a
                        whole year passing, with out so much as five dollars coming into the hands of any one Professor.
                        I did not receive money enough to pay my postage; and S. C. Cooper had to settle it and I paid
                        him in College warrants. So for all the necessaries of life, our active and busy agent, would
                        hunt up those in the country who had subscribed, to erection of the building, and them to haul
                        us wood, and bring us articles of food, and he would credit the amount on their notes.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1843, The Trustees negotiated a Loan from the Bank of twenty five hundred hundred
                        dollars, and paid off the out-standing warrants of the Faculty, and in consideration of prompt
                        payment they consented to a reduction of their salaries one hundred dollars each. The
                        President's was made $800. Prof. Larabees, $600, Prof.
                        Nutt's $500. Wheeler's $400, and Downey's
                        $400.</p>
                    <p>In 1844, at the spring session a plan for the permanent endowment of the University was adopted
                        by the Board. When the sale of Perpetual scholarships for one hundred dollars each with certain
                        limitations and restrictions as set forth in the Bond for schollarship was sanctioned by the two
                        Conferences into which Indiana had by this time been divided, and each Conference appointed two
                        agents to carry out the scheme Those for Indiana Conference, were Isaac Owen, and W[illiam]. C.
                        Smith, and Aron Wood, and J[ohn]. C. Smith of North Indiana.</p>

                    <p>In the meantime efforts were to be made by private donations from the Preachers and members of
                        the Church for the relief of the Faculty. This measure only partially succeeded, and after a few
                        years was laid asside.</p>
                    <p>The scholarship plan, by the untiring and indefatigable labors of the agents and especially those
                        of Isaac Owen to whom the Institution is greatly indebted, was crowed with complete success; so
                        that now there are nearly seventy thousand dollars invested, yielding a revenue of
                        $7000 per annum, and furnishing ample for all current expenses. And it is anticipated
                        that soon that one hundred thousand will be invested, and the Institution be triumphantly borne
                        beyond pecuniary wants.</p>
                    <p>An increase in the salaries took place in 1853 and the President's fixed at thirteen
                        hundred dollars and those of the rest of the Faculty increased, but not in the same ratio. In
                        1855 the salaries of the Professors was made nine hundred and the Preceptor eight hundred and in
                        1856, one thousand dollars was given to each of the Professors and fourteen hundred to the
                        President, and to the Adjunct, professor nine hundred; thus the sum annually paid to the Faculty
                        is seven thousand three hundred dollars</p>
                    <p>In the main the Board have managed the Financial affairs with discretion. In the early stagese of
                        the history of the University with very commendable economy as to teachers salaries, but not so
                        with regard to the construction of the edifice; which cost the Board about twenty five thousand
                        dollars, when it ought not to have cost more than fifteen or eighteen thousand. The
                        superintendent was employed at a salary of $1200 a year and continued several years,
                        and the workman were all employed by the trustees directly, there being no contractor.</p>
                    <p>The first President, M. Simpson was a man of singular ability in many respects. He was
                        exceedingly popular both the students and people. He was affable and exceedingly kind in address
                        and conversation, and seldom failed in make a favorable impression upon every one with whom he
                        conversed. Possessed of some wit, and a smattering of all kinds of learning, and even deeply
                        versed in intellectual science and moral Philosophy, he appeared to advantage in conversation.
                        The elements of popularity were abundant in him. He was emphatically one of the people. Soon
                        after he arrived, one of the sovereigns from the country called at his room when he left he told
                        his neighbor, "That Simpson was the man, for he was not too proud to were satenet
                        pants." The greatest <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-053-1-071"/> artlessness and simplicity,
                        with the appearance of great humility were manifest in his deportment.</p>
                    <p>His pulpit ministrations was another source of his great popularity with the masses. A ready
                        utterance in a musical and attractive voice, vividness of fancy, aptness of illustration, and
                        great fervency and glow of feeling, captivated his audience which were always tremendous, when
                        it was known that he was going to preach. His sermons were mostly descriptive. It was seldom
                        that he attempted an argumentative discourse. He was a man of enterprise. Never satisfied with
                        present attainments, he was always revoling or evolving, some plan or scheme for the advancement
                        of the interests of the College the church, his friends, and last though not least, of himself.
                        Few men possess greater tact for managing others, and succeeding in his schemes. He kept himself
                        thoroughly posted in regard to the character of those about him, and their movements. All the
                        gossip of the town and the private affairs of the families and individuals of the neighborhood,
                        he managed to have reported to him immediately and he was strongly suspected of employing a
                        system of espionage not only over the students but over the citizens of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                        </placeName> and the Preachers of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>He was a good manager of the boys in the College, making the best students his warm personal
                        friends, he used them in gaining information of the conduct of the rest. In disguise he
                        frequently visited suspected places, and unknown to the boys, he was sometimes with them in
                        their sprees, and the next day they were very much astonished as the Doctor would tell them all
                        that they had done. Sometimes after having taken round with the boys for an hour or two, he
                        would suddenly throw off the disguise and "Say well Boys we have had a fine time
                        tonight—it is about time to retire now." They could scarely believe their
                        own eyes, when they would take to there scrapers in double quic time. Many a night the Doctor
                        was out nearly all night. He employed, Charles G. Downey and John Wheeler as his assistants, in
                        learning the practices of the boys, so that during his administration there prevailed an
                        impression among the students, "that it was no use to try to keep any thing secret.
                        That the president would find it out in spite of them" Some of them declaring, that
                        they believed, "Old Doc" was omni-present." Yet so kind and familiar
                        was he that all the boys loved him.</p>
                    <p>Yet he had his faults. One of which was vindictiveness. He was never known to concileate an
                        enemy; but it was a <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-053-1-072"/> war of extermination. He was remarkably
                        successful in throwing things in the way of those he did not like; and this was done secretly,
                        the hand that gave the blow was always concealed. Indeed, secrecy was a part of his character,
                        which he never denied, but said that it prevented opposition. Hence he often carried measures by
                        surprise. He was a great admirer of Loyola and the system of Jesuits, speaking of them in the
                        highest terms as well calculated to effect the objects designed. So far as secrecy and espionage
                        is concerned, he made them his patern. His motto was that all men were governed by self
                        interest, and that they could be led to any measures, if they could be made to believe that
                        their interests would be promoted by them.</p>
                    <p>While he would do much for his friends, while he could use them he was never known to adhere to a
                        sinking friend to his own detriment. He had a strong predilection for John Wheeler. He educated
                        him, and found him a place in the University by blending the Preparatory and Collegiate
                        Departments, and thus dividing the Professorships. Thus also he divided the Professorship of
                        Mathematics to give Downey a place, and it is proper to say that they both were sensible of
                        their obligations and repaid them with faithful service. Both these men were proteges of the
                        President; and the latter, out of over zeal for the Doctor commenced a war upon Mrs. Larrabee<hi rend="sup">27</hi> and her school, which finally involed the Doctor in an unpleasant
                        controversy, and led to his soliciting the post of editor of The Western Christian Advocate in
                        1848, and his resignation of the Presidency.</p>
                    <p>The President was not blessed with a fine exterior, or commanding presence. Rather tall stoop
                        shouldered, blue eyes, light hair, low forehead and some what retreating, and chin large and
                        prominent. When animated his appearance was interesting from the unusual brightness of his large
                        and prominent eyes.</p>

                    established in Indiana during the nineteenth century. In spite of frequent and often fulsome
                    statements from sponsors and friends about their "flourishing condition," all of
                    them had major and continuing difficulties and many, like Smithson College, had only a brief

            <p>The document which follows is a circular which was presumably used to solicit students and to convey
                    information about the college to prospective patrons. The curriculum afforded students more
                    individual choice than in some contemporary institutions. Although the Universalists were heterodox
                    in their theology, the circular indicates that students were required to conform to conservative
                    traditions and mores.</p>
            <p>The college was in advance of the times in its vigorous affirmation of coeducation. In fact, if equal
                    opportunity regardless of sex also applied to the faculty so that the Lady Principal actually

                    Colleges of private foundation are rivals of our public schools, or ought ever to become so; and
                    will ever strive to make their institution a complement, and not a hindrance to the highest possible

                    The numerous and generous subscriptions to the College, evince a local interest in its welfare,

            <p rend="center">GROUNDS AND BUILDINGS.</p>
            <p>The grounds of the School are situated on the north side of the river, within the corporate limits of
                    the city, and contain twelve acres, partly covered with forest trees. The site of the buildings is
                    one hundred and fifty feet above the river, over-looking the city, giving a prospect of the
                        <geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> for miles, furnishing landscape views of surpassing beauty.
                    The College building fronts south, with eastern and western entrances, and presents a perspective
                    view to the city. The ground descends from the front in a series of natural terraces, broken on the
                    western side by a deep ravine, in which breaks out a copious spring of pure water. Nature has formed
                    no more beautiful situation for such a school, and art will be called in to ornament and improve it
                    with roads, walks, gardens, fountains, and all that can refine and cultivate the students.</p>
            <p>The buildings designed are spacious and beautiful. No money is wasted in useless display, but every
                    care has been taken to supplement the skill of the architect by the experience of the teacher, so as
                    to produce the most perfect College edifice in the West. Its extreme length is 340 feet, and its
                    greatest depth 120 feet. Of irregular outline, its noble tower, numerous pavillions and deep
                    shadows, impart an unusual grandeur to its general appearance. On four floors the corridors extend
                    through the building, furnishing promenades 300 feet long. It is furnished with a spacious Chapel,
                    Lecture room, Academy room, Parlor, Dining Room, Library, Museum and Gymnasiums, as well as special
                    Painting, Apparatus and Recitation rooms. It is arranged to board two hundred students, in rooms of
                    large size, and with all the conveniences of a first-class hotel. It will be heated by steam,
                    lighted with gas, and supplied with water throughout. The Kitchen, Boiler, Gas and Laundry house are
                    outside the main building, and thorough in all their appointments. Fire is therefore but a remote
                    danger; but if such a contingency should occur, <hi rend="i">four</hi> spacious stairways give ready
                    egress and escape, instead of the usual single one. The central building, 144 feet long, arranged
                    for eighty boarders, is now in process of erection, and will be ready for occupancy at the opening
                    of the school, while the remainder will be pushed forward with all possible dispatch.</p>

            <p rend="center">EQUALITY OF EDUCATION.</p>
            <p>Believing that the happiness of the sexes requires them to live together in the companionship of
                    equals, this College opens its doors to them on the same terms. Teachers and students will take
                    equal rank, without regard to sex, and individual merit and attainment must determine the relative
                    standing. Experience has demonstrated that educating the sexes in the same schools, classes and
                    studies, is alike beneficial to intellectual culture, sound morality, and refinement of manners.
                    Care will be taken to prevent all improper familiarity, to inculcate principles of honor and purity,
                    and impress upon students that in the school they are equal as scholars. To evince the sincerity of
                    their convictions on this point, the Trustees have made the Lady Principal of the school a
                    Professor, with equal rank and pay with others.</p>
            <p rend="center">DISCIPLINE.</p>
            <p>The discipline of the College will be moral, and will be efficiently maintained. The President and
                    faculty will lodge in the building, board with the students, and have a constant parental oversight
                    of them. The Lady Principal will have especial charge of the young ladies; the domestic department
                    is presided over by a competent Matron; and the building so arranged as to secure a complete
                    separation between the two lodging apartments. The principles of the Christian religion will be
                    taught as the basis of right, but not merely sectarian dogmas. Students will be required to attend
                    church punctually, and with the President and Faculty, unless parents designate a particular place.
                    No immoral conduct, or vicious habits will knowingly be permitted; and no difficulty of management
                    is apprehended.</p>
            <p rend="center">STUDIES.</p>
            <p>The courses of study are prepared to meet the wants of the greatest number, but no intention exists
                    of lowering the standard of liberal education. The classical will be the regular course, and the
                    Academic and Philosophic are only commended to those who cannot take the other. The details of these
                    courses, cost of tuition, board, &amp;c., are found in the following pages, and are commended to
                    careful attention. We <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-053-1-080"/> shall not seek the reputation of a <hi rend="i">cheap</hi> school, but a <hi rend="i">good</hi> one, while all charges are placed as
                    low as necessary expenses will permit. The President and Faculty are teachers of large experience,
                    and thoroughly qualified for their positions, and will use the utmost zeal and care to improve their
                    students, and render satisfaction to all concerned. Ample provision has been made for instruction in
                    the extra branches, such as Music and Drawing, and the instruments provided will be of the best
                    quality. In every department, both of sound learning and artistic culture, Smithson College will aim
                    to take a high rank.</p>
            <p rend="center">OPENING.</p>
            <p>The Trustees take great pleasure in saying that the progress of their building warrants them in
                    announcing the opening of the school for the first of January next Arrangements will be made for
                    suitable services for the opening of the building, the inauguration of the President and Faculty,
                    and the organization of classes, and on Thursday, January 4th, 1872, regular lessons will begin.
                    Great care will be taken to open the College on the most approved models, but such changes will
                    always be made as experience dictates, and every effort will be used to have this a high-toned,
                    efficient and successful school. They therefore come before the public with great confidence, and
                    ask the patronage of the friends of liberal education. They are assured that there is room for every
                    well organized school, and an especial mission for this. Taking front rank as an expression of the
                    liberal thought of the times, and proposing to keep pace with the progress of the age, it cannot
                    fail of success if wisely administered. We assail no other institution, and make no invidious
                    comparisons, but we appeal with great earnestness and assurance to Universalists and other liberal
                    people of Indiana, who are no longer to be satisfied with the old theology of the church, to rally
                    around this representative of religious liberality, and give it the support which will insure its
                    usefulness and power.</p>

            <p>While it is the design of Smithson College to erect as high a standard of education as that of any
                    other, it is still recognized that it must also be prepared to do its share of labor in educating
                    the youth of the country for the common business of life. Hence it has arranged for the following

            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-053-1-087"/>
            <p rend="center">EXTRA STUDIES.</p>
            <p>Ample provision has been made for instruction in the departments of Music and the Arts. Singing by
                    the pupils under competent instructors will be a daily exercise; and both Vocal and Instrumental
                    Music will be taught in classes. Drawing, Painting, Wax Work, and other ornamental branches will be
                    taught by competent instructors. The object will be to give every facility for the most
                    accomplished, as well as the most substantial education. As these branches will be optional, they
                    will not be allowed to trespass on the regular studies.</p>
            <p rend="center">EXPENSES.</p>
            <p>The rates of charges adopted in the following tables, are based on a very careful estimate of
                    expenditures; and it is held as a sound principle, that the former should equal the latter. No good
                    can come of affecting a cheapness whose inevitable result is debt, embarrassment and inefficiency.
                    Nor is it wise to put down low rates of board and tuition in tables, and then largely increase them
                    by extra charges. Our statements, therefore, will give the parent the total cost, and will enable
                    the School to meet its obligations.</p>
            <p>B<hi rend="sc">OARD</hi> will be five dollars per week. This will include room rent, table expenses,
                    light, fuel and washing. This will be sixty-five dollars for each term of thirteen weeks, and one
                    hundred and ninety-five dollars per year. Students can remain in the institution during the
                    vacations between terms at the same rates; but not during the annual vacation, as the teachers and
                    help will then be off duty, and the buildings undergo renovation. Two students will occupy one room,
                    and will be assigned by the President. Each room will be furnished with a bedstead, mattrass [<hi rend="i">stc</hi>], quilt, blanket and pillows, a bureau, washstand and its furniture, writing
                    table and three chairs. Students must furnish their own carpets, sheets, pillow cases, towels,
                    napkins and soap. Carpets furnished, of any quality desired at an annual charge of one third their
                    cost.</p>
            <p>No meals furnished away from the common tables, ro [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] out of the regular hours,
                    except at the discretion of the President and upon special charges, except in cases of sickness.</p>
            <p>Twelve average pieces are allowed in wash each week. More than this are charged at the rate of
                    seventy-five cents per dozen. Sheets, pillow cases, towels and napkins are not counted.</p>
            <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-053-1-088"/>
            <p>The President, Professors and all paid teachers, are required to live in the building, and their
                    board will be furnished them at the lowest possible rate.</p>

            <p rend="center">STUDENT'S OUTFIT.</p>
            <p>There should be a full supply of strong and comfortable clothing, suitable to the season. It may
                    conform to the means of the family; but extravagance and unnecessary finery, and mere display should
                    be avoided. Utility, not ornament, should be the purpose. Each student should have an umbrella,
                    overshoes, and thick shawl or overcoat, at least three sheets, six towels, four napkins, one
                    blanket, and a few pieces of woolen, muslin and old linen, brushes, combs, toilet soap, pins,
                    needles, thread and buttons.</p>
            <p>All articles should be plainly marked with the full name, to prevent mistakes and loss.</p>
            <p>A few pictures and miscellaneous books will add to the cheerfulness of the room; but all such will be
                    subject to the inspection and approval of the President.</p>
            <p rend="center">ANNUAL COST.</p>
            <p>The necessary annual expenses will be, for the first year of the Academic course, and each year of
                    the Philosophical and Preparatory courses: Board, $195,00; Tuition, $30,00;
                    Incidentals, $4,50; Total, $229,50. For the first and second years of the
                    College course, six dollars more for tuition, $235,50. The second year of the Academic,
                    and the third <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-053-1-089"/> and fourth of the Collegiate courses, add each one
                    foreign language, $24,00; the first, $253,50, and the other two,
                    $259,50. The third year of the Academic adds another language, making $277,50.
                    The ornamental branches are optional, and can be calculated from the table.</p>
            <p rend="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</p>
            <p>Especial attention is called to the following general rules:</p>
            <p>1. One half the expense of each term must be paid in advance, and the other half at the middle of the
                    term. This rule must be <hi rend="i">strictly enforced</hi> to enable the institution to meet its
                    expenses. No delay can be permitted, and no student enrolled until payment is made.</p>
            <p>2. No deduction from tuition on account of absence; nor from board, except for absence of more than
                    two weeks on account of sickness, or written leave of the President.</p>
            <p>3. Students received at any time during the term, and charged proportionately for the residue.</p>
            <p>4. Accounts opened with each student, money paid in is at once credited, and on settlement, promptly
                    refunded when in excess.</p>
            <p>5. No more money should be supplied to students than their necessities require; and parents should
                    demand a strict and detailed report of expenditures.</p>
            <p>6. All money furnished for the use of students should be paid to the President, and drawn as needed
                    on the order of the student. This will serve as a check on indiscretion, and teach orderly business
                    habits.</p>
            <p rend="center">GENERAL REGULATIONS.</p>
            <p>1. The Faculty, Instructors and Students are expected at all times to remember that they are ladies
                    and gentlemen, and to conform to the usages of good society in their intercourse with each other, as
                    well as with those without the institution.</p>
            <p>2. The association of young men and young women in the same classes and exercises, appeals powerfully
                    and constantly to a healthful spirit of emulation, and is greatly promotive of a thorough
                    scholarship. The average tone of scholarship is decidedly higher in those classes where both sexes
                    are well represented, than in a class composed exclusively either of gentlemen or ladies. In the
                    matter of rhetorical or oratorical exercises, this result is brilliantly obvious.</p>
            <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-053-1-090"/>
            <p>3. The daily association of young ladies and gentlemen, in the presence of their teachers, exerts a
                    most salutary effect upon the <hi rend="i">manners of both</hi>; tending largely to render the young
                    men courteous, self-respectful, refined and manly, and the young women modest, decorous, graceful
                    and womanly. A young lady educated thus, naturally, is likely to become self-poised and to develop a
                    symmetry and completeness of intellectual stature rarely attainable under less favorable
                    circumstances.</p>
            <p>4. Wholesome restraints are necessary, certainly, in a seminary for both ladies and gentlemen; but
                    such restraints are easily enforced when not self-imposed, in an institution properly constructed
                    and arranged for <hi rend="i">two departments.</hi> There is with most young men and young women,
                    when connected with a seminary of learning, a self-respect and pride of character which alone go
                    further than parental vigilance in conserving their social respectability and safety. Order once
                    established, the internal conservative forces of such an institution renders gross disorder well
                    nigh impossible, and the work of government correspondingly easy.</p>
            <p rend="center">MERIT AND DEMERIT.</p>
            <p>MERIT.—The scale of merit ranges from 50 to 100. Below 60 is inferior; from 70 to 80, fair
                    to good; from 80 to 90, superior; above 90, very superior.</p>
            <p>DEMERIT.—Each demerit mark diminishes deportment 5; 5 marks require an explanation; 12,
                    public reproof; and 20, dismission.</p>
            <p>Absences, deficiencies, improprieties and disorders are marked. The last measure of discipline will
                    be expulsion. A public report of the student's standing is read during the term, and at the
                    close furnished in a permanent form to each. <hi rend="i">Parents are requested to examine this
                        report</hi>.</p>
            <p>Parents and guardians are requested to communicate freely by letter, and are earnestly advised not to
                    allow their children or wards to be absent, visiting at home or elsewhere, or to leave the School
                    until after the Examination, except where there is manifest necessity.</p>

            <p>The edition of <hi rend="i">Readings in Indiana History</hi> published by Indiana University in 1914
                    under the guidance of a committee of the History Section of the Indiana State Teachers Association
                    has long been out of print. The stated purpose of the compilers of the volume under review is to
                    replace the 1914 edition with a work that includes much of what was considered good in the old <hi rend="i">Readings,</hi> to aim at no particular level of reader, and to fill in gaps in Indiana
                    history as far as available material permits. According to the editors, "the compilation of
                    such a work is difficult because there is not in print a good one-volume history of Indiana which
                    can be read in conjunction with the <hi rend="i">Readings</hi>" (p. v).</p>
            <p>A reviewer is tempted to make a comparison between the two editions.</p>
            <p>The earlier volume contained materials which the committee felt were best adapted to "pupils
                    of the grammar grades and the high school." This material was mostly primary source
                    material which advanced students have found useful as well. The work included extremely helpful maps
                    and illustrations. In addition, its organization was enhanced by brief but sharp historical
                    introductions to each period or topic. Its coverage did not extend beyond 1876 and, being primarily
                    concerned with the period before the Civil War, it proved to be a good companion to Logan
                    Esarey's <hi rend="i">History of Indiana From the Earliest Explorations to 1850</hi> which
                    appeared in 1915.</p>
            <p>The editors of the recent edition of the <hi rend="i">Readings</hi> have eliminated maps and
                    illustrations and thinned the historical introductions. They have used some of the same sources,
                    added considerably more material, and broadened the definition of "readings" by a
                    freer inclusion of secondary articles which serve to close <hi rend="i">selected</hi> gaps. The
                    paucity of material related to the period from 1876 to the present is unfortunate. <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-053-1-096"/> Twenty-eight chapters are devoted to the period through 1876. The four
                    chapters which follow would seem to belong to a second volume.</p>
            <p>Some readers will welcome the excellent material that has been added, especially that dealing with
                    the development of industry. However, other readers will regret the elimination of good material on
                    the Indians of Indiana. This problem is minimized by the fact that both editions will be found in
                    most libraries in the state, making available a broader selection of readings than hitherto existed
                    in print.</p>
            <p>It is readily admitted that the selection of material for a one-volume "readings"
                    is difficult in the absence of a correlative history. The sources selected for both editions,
                    however relate primarily to the period before 1865. It seems to this reviewer that Esarey's
                    above-mentioned history remains a valuable companion on a higher level of learning. The more
                    scholarly style of the new <hi rend="i">Readings</hi> tends to eliminate it as a
                    "primer." Further, if a one-volume history of Indiana, from its beginnings to the
                    present, should appear in the near future, the present edition will not be an adequate companion
                    without considerable revision to balance the historical coverage.</p>
            <p>Aside from the above observations, the 1956 edition of the <hi rend="i">Readings</hi> is a valuable
                    contribution to the field of Hoosier history and should stimulate further research in that area.</p>

            <p>This gap-filling monograph is like its subject in being an incitement to learning, fitted and aimed
                    for a wide audience. Written from the vantage point of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> sources, it maintains a national perspective, and by regional organization suggests
                    local variations. Its outstanding chapters, however, deal topically with lyceum economics and
                    connections with libraries and literature. There are sharp sketches of a score of "typical
                    leaders."</p>
            <p>Bode elaborates the accepted view that lyceums shifted emphasis from the mutual education of young
                    men in practical <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-053-1-097"/> science to random lectures on general culture
                    for public entertainment. Self-improvement and social uplift remained constants. We can still say
                    that Josiah Holbrook founded the lyceum movement in 1826, successfully promoted it for a decade, and
                    contributed valuable pressure for common school reform. We can still say that, except perhaps for
                    the major cities, the lyceum remained throughout the ante-bellum period the lengthened shadow of
                    Holbrook's <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName>, always strongest in eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. Even in southern cities the immigrant Yankee played an important part. But the popular
                    notion that lyceums consisted of lectures only, and the general historian's habit of
                    identifying them with Holbrook only, are no longer tenable.</p>
            <p>Bode's background sketches could have been enriched by drawing on Dirk Struik's <hi rend="i">Yankee Science,</hi> C. A. Bennett's <hi rend="i">Manual Labor Education,</hi>
                    and other studies of "freedom's ferment." People were yearning to be as
                    free as the truth could make them, and as rich as American resources could make them. Stirred by
                    land hunger, the expanding needs of industrialism, and the evangelical movement, Americans felt a
                    need for "useful" education which existing institutions could or would not meet.
                    Consequently a number of makeshift "systems" appeared: monitorial and manual labor
                    education, mechanics' and teachers' institutes, mercantile libraries, young
                    men's associations, and lyceums. When academic and governmental research and instruction
                    developed, toward 1840, with better libraries, laboratories, buildings, funds, and personnel, these
                    supplementary stop-gaps became unnecessary. As educational reform the lyceum was an ephemeral <hi rend="i">movement.</hi> As adult education, whose main ingredient is initial stimulation, it was
                    an <hi rend="i">institution</hi> which answered a perennial need, and it has been succeeded by other
                    efforts, especially in fields not yet taught in the schools. Bode does not easily distinguish the
                    crusade from the institution.</p>
            <p>Beginnings are indefinite. Did the lyceum idea really cross the Atlantic in a magazine, or did it
                    develop a generation after its British counterpart, as an indigenous reflection of particular stages
                    of Protestantism and industrialism? Bode suggests both. The printed word can buttress a convert, but
                    doesn't it take a missionary <hi rend="i">person</hi> to make one? What of the personal
                    contacts with the British movement, through emigrant mechanics like Timothy Claxton, and such
                    travelers as Benjamin <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-053-1-098"/> Silliman (Holbrook's teacher),
                    John Griscom, William Wood, William Maclure, and possibly the Owens?</p>
            <p>The author's topical and sectional organization minimizes the developments within his period
                    (1826–1861), although at points (pp. 45, 185, 239, 250) he bows to the chronological
                    approach. He admits (p. 40) that 1845 is not a "solid" dividing point. A real
                    break did occur in 1837, when Holbrook joined a communitarian "lyceum village"
                    experiment at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Berea</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, and lost influence in the national movement. The lyceum had been
                    safe for the pillars of society to support: it banned religious and political sectarianism and
                    proposed to make the young man more valuable to his boss. But Holbrook's move labeled him
                    an impractical "ultraist" and the moderates followed their other interests. At the
                    same time other causes split into radical and moderate wings.</p>
            <p>The American lyceum seems to have correlated positively with cities and their large, mobile middle
                    class; with manu-facturing; with access to main routes; and with literacy. Negative correlations
                    appear with the frontier, slavery, Irish and German immigrants, and religious groups either
                    supporting church schools or indifferent to a trained ministry. These correlations seem to depend on
                    impressionistic use of gross statistics which conceal, for example, wilderness areas within states.
                    In the Old Northwest and the upper Northeast, did local religious, political, and economic factors
                    condition the lyceum milieu more than the frontier? The Southport (Kenosha, Wis.) lyceum, dismissed
                    as a debating society, and Maclure's <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Workingmen's Institute were frontier efforts. Indiana, ruled out for its
                    Hoosier crudity, was not so much sparsely settled in the thirties as late-settled in the north, and
                    inhabited by people unmoved by the lyceum's appeal for rationalist uplift. A further
                    correlation with Whigs, Congregationalists (and related groups) and their college towns might be
                    fruitful. Tables, graphs or maps must be constructed—but not necessarily published, since
                    they are presumed to bore the "popular" audience—to support
                    quantitative conclusions.</p>
            <p>More research is needed, on the high level of Bode and James Kelso, whose unpublished thesis,
                    "The Lyceum and the Mechanics' Institutes" (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1953), fills in where Bode is weak. A life of Josiah Holbrook would illuminate the
                    first decade. David Mead's study for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, 1850–1870, stands <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-053-1-099"/> almost alone; Indiana
                    and other states need similar treatment. Since ministers and professors were most frequently
                    leaders, the roles of church and college need to be assessed. The free lance, accepted because of
                    the talent shortage, deserves attention, along with literary, historical, agricultural, and village
                    improvement societies. The definition of a lyceum, accompanying the delightful frontispiece,
                    includes debates, drama, "and the like," but the author excludes or neglects these
                    aspects. Finally, if the lyceum worked itself out of one job with the success of school reform, if
                    it aided essayists and augmented libraries, did it realize any of its other pious resolutions? The
                    propaganda nature of the handy sources makes firm conclusions difficult. How many scientists, like
                    Maria Mitchell, received some of their basic training in a lyceum? What effect did the use of visual
                    aids (e.g., Silliman's eighty square feet of paintings to illustrate a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lowell</settlement>
                    </placeName> lecture) have on the arts? The Associated Western Literary Society, incorporated in
                    1855, deserves more attention as the first successful booking agency.</p>
            <p>But an author is entitled to his own emphases. For Carl Bode's substantial contribution to
                    American studies, I would double-star his well-told story for your library.</p>

            <p>During his presidency Abraham Lincoln appointed five Supreme Court justices. These five, Noah H.
                    Swayne, Samuel F. Miller, David Davis, Stephen J. Field, and Salmon P. Chase, constituted one-half
                    of the Court's membership in 1865, above average in comparison with the administrations of
                    other chief executives. In this book Professor Silver ably describes the political circumstances
                    that influenced Lincoln in making his choices. The reorganization of the circuit system by the act
                    of Congress of July 15, 1862, caused the President to consider the geographical factor, and thus
                    three appointees (Swayne, Miller, and Davis) were midwesterners, while a fourth, Chief Justice
                    Chase, also came from that <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-053-1-100"/> section but was chosen for different
                    reasons. Lincoln did not search for men with judicial experience, and, except for Field, the new
                    members had not served on an important bench. Davis' background as an <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> circuit judge had nothing to do with his being selected. Nor was previous office
                    holding deemed essential, for only Chase had any significant qualifications in this respect. The
                    primary motive, Professor Silver concludes, was to find men with "sound views toward the
                    great political issues of the Civil War" (p. 57).</p>
            <p>In the opinion of many Republicans, the justices who had been appointed by Lincoln's
                    predecessors did not have sound views. Actions of the President early in the war posed serious
                    constitutional questions that might have been decided by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney and his
                    brethren in such a way as to handicap the Union effort. Lincoln's declaration of a blockade
                    of Confederate ports, challenged in the Prize Cases, was approved by the narrowest of margins (five
                    to four), and this only after nearly two years' delay in hearing and deciding those cases.
                    The three justices appointed by Lincoln before March, 1863, were in the majority, a fact which
                    explains Attorney General Edward Bates's hesitancy to risk an adverse judgment prior to
                    that time. The suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus by the executive without legislative
                    authority was attacked by Taney in <hi rend="i">Ex parte Merryman</hi> (1861). Subsequent extension
                    of the policy of arbitrary arrest and resort to martial law might well have been struck down. Other
                    measures, the Emancipation Proclamation, the income tax, conscription, and issuance of legal tender
                    notes, were imperiled by a Court thought to be unfriendly to the administration. Radicals, such as
                    John P. Hale, would have drastically remodeled that judicial body, but only the mild reform of
                    adding a tenth justice, Field, was enacted by Congress. The author labels this as
                    "packing" the Court, which might have been the objective, although he does not
                    present hard evidence to prove it.</p>
            <p>As it turned out, most of these questions were either determined favorably to the government or, more
                    often, evaded by the judiciary during the progress of the war. It was not until 1866 that the
                    Supreme Court in <hi rend="i">Ex parte Milligan</hi> ruled against trial of civilians by military
                    commissions in areas where the regular courts were open. Professor Silver says that this
                    "absolved" Taney. Here and at other points, however, this volume does not clearly
                    distinguish between <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-053-1-101"/> arbitrary arrest (suspension of the
                    privilege of habeas corpus) and military trial. The former was approved by Justice Davis in the
                    majority opinion, and the latter was disapproved. Of course the Habeas Corpus Law of March 3, 1863,
                    authorizing Lincoln's steps relative to arbitrary arrest, possibly removed some of
                    Taney's objections in the Merryman case, since Congress had now acted. Nevertheless,
                    something more than the Milligan decision was needed to "absolve" Taney.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Supreme Court</hi> is an excellent study of the relationship of Civil
                    War politics and the Supreme Court. Valuable sources, particularly the Lincoln Papers, are utilized
                    to great advantage. The general reader, as well as the historian, will find it interesting and
                    reliable. The constitutional historian will not find an exhaustive analysis of the legal aspects of
                    many problems, but the author did not intend to write that sort of book.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Fifth Wheel</hi> is still another in the avalanche of books on the
                    Civil War period now rolling off the press. These books have a ready market; for many this is their
                    main reason to be, and one immediately raises the question as to the justification for this volume.
                    The answer is that the book rests on a heretofore unused reservoir of material, and it covers a
                    well-known but badly neglected feature of the war.</p>
            <p>The author has plowed through the great mass of manuscripts now available on the period and found
                    every bit of material that applies to his subject. He takes great satisfaction in this, not that it
                    has netted much except the assurance that further pertinent evidence does not exist.</p>
            <p>The writer, perhaps unwittingly, has added his bit to the current process of rejuvenating the <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> tradition. He has helped line up the anti-slavery crusaders and their coadjutors for a
                    second century's vogue. His great reliance <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-053-1-102"/> on the
                    Olmstead manuscripts commits him. Contemporary opinion on the South and on slavery rested largely on
                    Olmstead, and his persuasions are not absent from Maxwell's book. It is only fair to say
                    that Maxwell has not sufficient material from other sources to enable him to exercise the
                    historian's right of sitting in judgment.</p>
            <p>In style the book is in the tradition of those who consider Parkman to be the greatest American
                    historian. It is exceptionally well written for one forged from a mass of research data rather than
                    from long experience and love of the field.</p>
            <p>For informative content the book is very much worth while. Through it the lover of detail can go to a
                    great battlefield and see the terrible aftermath of battle. He can also get a good idea of how
                    everyday details were handled in the army: sanitation, mess, medication, etc. Those interested in
                    the clash with politics, the impact of personalities, and the battle royal between Sanitary
                    Commission and Christian Commission will also be well rewarded.</p>
            <p>There are areas where one would like more information from the materials used even at the expense of
                    going beyond the scope of the book. For instance, more on the struggle to control the policies of
                    the administration might have been added, and also more on the clash of East-West sectionalism.
                    Because of the nature of the materials used, the history of the Commission as written by Maxwell
                    must of necessity be Eastern, and the author does not challenge Eastern priority. More about Frank
                    Blair would have been pertinent. Henry J. Raymond seems to act out of pattern. What is behind it? <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> proponents complain of the selfishness of the Pennsylvanians, and say that there is a

                    </placeName> contingent in the affairs of the Commission. One would like to know more of the
                    political implications of this charge.</p>

                    Maxwell's book is a welcome addition. Its acceptance is not based upon new information but
                    upon the meticulous research and the objectivity of its presentation. The book, a revised doctoral
                    dissertation, deals with the development and results of the progressive movement in the Badger State
                    during the period 1900–1915.</p>
            <p>

                    </placeName> Progressivism was a volatile, many-sided, intra-party movement which grew out of the
                    political unrest and the economic adversities of the last decades of the nineteenth century. The
                    Progressives, generally speaking, were composed of disgruntled farmers, maladjusted industrial
                    workers, and a sprinkling of middle-class intellectuals. In 1900 <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> was experiencing population shifts and urbanization. Two-thirds of her population, the
                    author states, were either foreign born or the children of foreign born parents.</p>
            <p>Like many other reformers, La Follette fought the conservative bosses in the state machine. Once in
                    power, he created the La Follette machine with La Follette as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>'s most powerful political boss. For several years "Fighting
                    Bob" dominated the Progressive movement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>. The split between the liberals came in 1912 when La Follette made his great blunder in
                    a speech at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Indeed, Woodrow Wilson won a plurality in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> in 1912 due, as the author shows, to the split between Roosevelt and La Follette.</p>
            <p>Governor La Follette began the practice of delivering his messages to the legislature in person. At
                    first not very successful in his program of reforms, he was re-elected twice and succeeded in
                    getting his program through the legislature. As revealed by Maxwell, the Progressive program
                    included greatly increased taxes upon and more regulation of the transportation companies, a more
                    equitable tax structure based on various types of property and income, changes in the policies of
                    insurance companies in the state, a veritable revolution in dairying, and civil service for state
                    employees. Such a program of centralization required the creation of many commissions. Extensive use
                    was made of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> faculty, especially of the staff in agriculture, economics, and sociology.</p>
            <p>The author points out the defects of the Badger State type of Progressivism. The initiative,
                    referendum, and recall <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-053-1-104"/> were not included, nor was woman
                    suffrage. There were evil by-products of La Follette's reform program, including wasteful
                    bureaucracy, excessive costs, and the University in the center of state politics.</p>
            <p>The author has been an objective observer and has written with a scholarly detachment which is
                    refreshing. This book is a significant addition to the large amount of literature already published
                    on the Progressive movement.</p>

            <p>A dozen volumes have thus far appeared in "The Library of American Biography,"
                    edited by Professor Oscar Handlin of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the present book, Dexter Perkins' <hi rend="i">Charles Evans Hughes and
                        American Democratic Statesmanship,</hi> is one of the latest in the series. The purpose of these
                    short readable volumes is to catch the interest of nonprofessional readers, and also to boil down
                    for busy students a number of more technical and lengthy biographies currently available.
                    "The Library of American Biography" has dealt with such figures as Ulysses S.
                    Grant, Elihu Root, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel F. B. Morse, Daniel Webster, William Lloyd Garrison,
                    and Woodrow Wilson. In accord with the "idea" approach to history, now so popular,
                    each biography distils out of its subject's life a connection with a basic idea in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">American</region>
                    </placeName> society, such as the American military tradition (Grant), the conservative tradition
                    (Root), national conservatism (Webster), or American democratic statesmanship (Hughes).</p>
            <p>Because of the skill of the authors and editor of this series, it is difficult to find any point of
                    criticism in the execution of the series' avowed purpose. In the case of <hi rend="i">Charles Evans Hughes and American Democratic Statesmanship,</hi> the book traces the obvious
                    phases of Hughes' public career: Hughes and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> politics (1905–1910), associate justice of the Supreme Court
                    (1910–1916), the presidential campaign of 1916, the League fight (1916–1921),
                    secretary of state (1921–1925), Hughes as chief justice (1930–1944), with
                    special attention to the effort by President Franklin D. <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-053-1-105"/>
                    Roosevelt in 1937 to "pack" the Supreme Court. There is a brief epilogue weighing
                    Hughes' contribution to American democratic statesmanship. Each volume in the series
                    contains a short note on the sources for further reading. Such is the crystalline organization of
                    Perkins' book. The writing is smooth and tight. The estimate of the subject is judicious
                    and convincing. Perkins is notably successful in pointing out some of Hughes' flaws:
                    tendencies at difficult times to tortuous and overly legal decisions; and a foolhardy reluctance to
                    engage in political fence-mending, an obtuseness to political necessity that allowed unnecessary
                    frictions with President Theodore Roosevelt during Hughes' governorship of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, and which, in 1916, cost the austere New Yorker the presidency.</p>
            <p>The scrupulous fairness of Perkins' biography—its willingness to see both sides
                    of its subject—is surely one of the most successful aspects of the book, and may well
                    make it a welcome corrective to the two-volume Pulitzer prizewinning biography of Hughes published
                    in 1951 by Merlo J. Pusey, which has been criticized as too favorable to its subject. In another
                    respect, however, the new book by Perkins may prove disappointing to some readers. The volumes by
                    Pusey are hard to beat when it comes to giving a "feel" for their subject. Pusey
                    knew Hughes, for Hughes assisted Pusey in his work. Pusey records in his long and superbly written
                    biography a mass of detail, of both a personal and public nature, which a small biography simply
                    cannot relate. Perkins' book lacks the breezy accounts of cabinet meetings in the Harding
                    era, the details of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> state politics of fifty years ago, and many other interesting matters included by
                    Pusey. Especially does one wish for descriptions of Hughes the man. In Perkins' book Hughes
                    for practical purposes is dead upon leaving the Supreme Court in 1944, whereas Pusey's
                    pages on Hughes in retirement (1944–1949) are among the most moving and memorable pages
                    this reviewer has read.</p>
            <p>This is not to criticize a brilliantly executed little book. Within its necessary confines, Dexter
                    Perkins' <hi rend="i">Charles Evans Hughes and American Democratic Statesmanship</hi> is a
                    first-rate piece, and if it lacks the richness of full-length biography, it should persuade its
                    readers to seek out the books of detail.</p>

            <p>A really definitive biography of Roosevelt may have to await the uncovering of source material still
                    in hiding, but Professor Frank Freidel of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> in his monumental undertaking has left little to be said thus far. The latest volume,
                        <hi rend="i">The Triumph,</hi> covers Roosevelt's gubernatorial career and his struggle
                    for the presidential nomination and election. Herein is reflected his genius in the management of
                    men. Like Al Smith, his predecessor as governor, his policies ran afoul of a hostile legislature.
                    But where Smith triumphed by knock-down, drag-out methods, Roosevelt reached his goal by finesse.
                    Both were effective in appealing to the people over the heads of the politicians. With the
                    presidential nomination in mind, Roosevelt had to move cautiously, since there was a militant
                    opposition to his nomination.</p>
            <p>The most interesting phase of the present volume to the reviewer, who was very close to the drama, is
                    Roosevelt's fight for the nomination and the dramatic break in his long friendship with Al
                    Smith. The opposition to his nomination was determined to prevent it at any cost to the Democratic
                    party. Anyone close to the drama cannot but marvel at the author's accuracy, even in minute
                    details, in telling the story.</p>
            <p>Roosevelt had been a valiant champion of his old chief. Against his own wishes, he had accepted the
                    gubernatorial nomination in 1928 upon Al Smith's urging. The tragic break in the relations
                    between the two men began when, without justification, Smith doubted Roosevelt's loyalty

                    </placeName> for governor and Smith lost it as the presidential nominee. Smith was strong in
                    character and constructive statesmanship but his fatal weakness was his extreme vanity. His chagrin,
                    however, was moderated by the belief that he would direct Roosevelt's policies in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for he had no doubt that his old lieutenant would act unquestioningly on his
                    recommendations. He even planned to take quarters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Expecting to dominate the new regime through her, he strongly urged Roosevelt to
                    retain as advisor Mrs. Belle Moskowitz, an idolator of Smith's and a woman of undoubted
                    brilliance. Mrs. Moskowitz actually began writing Roosevelt's inaugural address and first
                    message to the <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-053-1-107"/> legislature. But when Roosevelt did not retain
                    her and wrote his own inaugural address and message, another blow was struck at Smith's
                    vanity.</p>
            <p>The break then began openly. Annoyed by the popularity of his old friend, and planning a test of
                    their popular appeal, Smith made a fight against a constitutional amendment to be submitted to the
                    people to which Roosevelt was committed and, when the amendment carried, Smith's resentment
                    flamed. The final blow came when Roosevelt failed to consult the "Happy Warrior"
                    before entering the race for the presidential nomination.</p>
            <p>John J. Rascob, the Republican chairman of the Democratic National Committee, by virtue of
                    Smith's election, was an ultraconservative and his bitter prejudice against Roosevelt may
                    be ascribed in part to his opposition to Roosevelt's economic views, but in large part to
                    his devotion to Smith. Dr. Freidel takes us behind the scenes when the organization determined to
                    prevent Roosevelt's nomination by hook or crook. A first plan was to nominate Owen D.
                    Young, a corporation executive, and when he refused to play, it pinned its hopes on Newton D. Baker
                    until he refused to make an open bid for the nomination. The committee then fell back on the
                    traditional plan of encouraging a flock of "favorite son" candidacies to create a
                    deadlock and make it difficult for Roosevelt to muster the necessary two-thirds vote. When this
                    promise dimmed, the committee brought pressure on Al Smith to announce his candidacy. There was
                    cruelty in this move, for the men who pressured Smith, with few exceptions, knew he could not be
                    nominated, while the victim of their strategy thought that he could. It was believed that he might
                    collect enough support to create the deadlock needed, and that with two <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> candidates the convention would nominate neither.</p>
            <p>The biographer minutely describes the pitfalls prepared by the conspirators for Roosevelt. They began
                    by demanding from him a wringing wet declaration against prohibition. If he responded it would
                    deprive him of delegates from the dry states; if he refused it might deprive him of support in the
                    wet states of the East. Convinced that it was common knowledge that he favored the repeal of the
                    Eighteenth Amendment, Roosevelt avoided the trap.</p>
            <p>The other trap was laid not by the Rascob people but by the reform element. This trap was in the form
                    of a demand <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-053-1-108"/> that Roosevelt remove Mayor James Walker, an
                    elective officer, because of disclosures of corruption in Tammany circles. The head of this element
                    was Samuel Seabury who, ironically enough, had been recommended by Roosevelt to act as inquisitor in
                    the investigation. The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> press responded with hysterical enthusiasm and Seabury, pictured as a Cato, began to
                    scent the presidential nomination for himself. Since Walker was immensely popular, his removal would
                    have aligned the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> organization against Roosevelt; yet failure to remove him would have lost Roosevelt the
                    support of the reform element. The biographer has missed one scene in the drama witnessed by this
                    reviewer who was with Roosevelt in the executive mansion in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> when a carload of the testimony taken by Seabury was delivered, accompanied by a short
                    letter from the investigator. Roosevelt had closed his doors to the press, and the reviewer was
                    alone with him when he read Seabury's letter with an expression of distaste. "He
                    merely drops it into my lap to embarrass me and he makes no recommendation of his own to serve his
                    own political ends," Roosevelt said. This embarrassing problem was solved when
                    Roosevelt's extraordinarily clever manager, James A. Farley, warned Walker of the
                    inevitable and prevailed upon him to tender his resignation.</p>
            <p>Never have a National Committee and its leaders so openly attempted to prevent a presidential
                    nomination. Professor Freidel makes no reference to a significant snubbing of Roosevelt in the
                    planning of the traditional Jackson Day banquet in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, always attended by party leaders of the nation, when candidates for the nomination
                    were invariably invited to speak. To eliminate Roosevelt from the banquet board, no avowed
                    candidates were to be invited and the speakers were confined to the three living former nominees of
                    the party—John W. Davis, James M. Cox, and Al Smith. Smith had not then announced his
                    candidacy, but both he and Cox were candidates under cover and both were favored by the
                    conspirators.</p>
            <p>However, at the convention the Smith candidacy, which Rascob and his associates had forced, turned
                    out to be a boomerang. When he visited all the candidates this reviewer found everyone astonished
                    because no meeting of the anti-Roosevelt aspirants had been called to work out strategy, and bitter
                    because Smith was "stealing the show," and because the impression was being
                    encouraged that the nomination would have to go either to Roosevelt or Smith.</p>
            <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-053-1-109"/>
            <p>The deadlock did not develop because of the refusal of Jack Garner, a candidate, to create a
                    deadlock. He had never taken his candidacy too seriously, and he wanted no repetition of the
                    notorious deadlock of 1924 that wrecked the party. He so informed Sam Rayburn, his floor manager;
                    the secret leaked to Farley, and in the resulting conference Garner's delegates went to
                    Roosevelt, and Garner was selected the vice presidential nominee.</p>
            <p>Professor Freidel's account of the campaign is sufficiently detailed. One item, however,
                    puzzles the reviewer. The biographer makes the point that while Roosevelt favored a vigorous attack
                    on Hoover's subordinates, he was dead set against an attack directly on their chief, and he
                    has found a letter from Garner to Roosevelt promising "to punch the Administration in the
                    nose, especially Hoover" (p. 324). While Garner was a powerful debater he abhorred the
                    stump and it was with the greatest difficulty that he was persuaded to make one speech to the nation
                    via the radio. When the party leaders urged him to make a slashing attack and found him reluctant
                    they were astonished. Had Roosevelt vetoed the plan to "punch the Administration in the
                    nose, especially Hoover?" Garner was at the Biltmore Hotel in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> the day he was to make his radio speech in the evening, and this reviewer was asked by
                    Rayburn to see him and urge a militant attack. Why not Rayburn? "Because," Rayburn
                    explained, "the old man is sore at me for urging him to make a speaking campaign."
                    I found Garner in a mellow thoughtful mood and he promised to make a vigorous attack, and then
                    added: "I wonder if the people will feel sorry for Hoover." That night the attack
                    was vigorous, but with that he retired to his <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> home and maintained silence throughout the campaign. Was this his protest against
                    Roosevelt's idea of making no direct attack on Hoover? It is an interesting footnote to
                    history.</p>
            <p>The very few things the biographer omits do not detract significantly from the fascinating story
                    Freidel has told, based on the mountains of manuscript he consulted at Hyde Park and his
                    conversations with participants in the scenes portrayed. Whatever the future may uncover, it is not
                    likely that future biographers will be able to throw much new light on the years covered in <hi rend="i">The Triumph.</hi>

                    </placeName> have historical significance chiefly because of their episcopal activities. Stephen
                    Theodore Badin's contribution was personal. He was already a cleric when he came to this
                    country and had received almost all his training in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> among ecclesiastics of rigorist traditions. To his classical training he soon added a
                    good command of the English language before being sent by Bishop John Carroll of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> to work among the transplanted <placeName>

                    </placeName> Catholics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. Other Catholic missionaries came to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and departed after a brief service, but Father Badin remained for two decades the
                    foundation stone and the pillar of strength of Catholicism in the trans-Allegheny missions.</p>
            <p>When this twenty-five year old priest reached <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Scott County</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1793 and began his missionary journeys on foot and on horseback, he did not fit the
                    picture of the heroic pioneer. He was a stern man of small stature whose broad mouth and sharp eyes
                    were not given to smiles. Yet he soon acquired the respect of his fellow pioneers by his
                    tirelessness, his courage, and the strictness of his life and teachings. Schauinger has called these
                    first years in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> missions "the lonely years," but Badin was always a lonely figure,
                    chiefly because of his unique personality and his rigorism. He was a severe critic of frontier
                    amusements, partly because of the roughness of these gatherings and partly because of his reform
                    ascetical tendencies; yet his understanding of the problems of the frontier was profound and his
                    sympathy equally deep. The members of his missions—largely families of English origin
                    with a long tradition as a Catholic minority—readily accepted his plans for Catholic
                    education and social life. In his strictness he was critical <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-053-1-111"/> of
                    the more moderate religious traditions, especially as he encountered them in the English Dominican
                    Fathers.</p>
            <p>The great crisis in Badin's life came with the appointment of Bishop Flaget as the first
                    Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bardstown</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1808. Until that time Badin, as Vicar General, had been the chief pastor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. He welcomed the establishment of regular episcopal jurisdiction in the West but soon
                    disagreed with the Bishop about what power and property he would retain after Flaget's
                    arrival. At the time, the American practice of episcopal control of all property had not yet been
                    established and there was some justice in Badin's claim to ownership of some of the
                    properties. Nevertheless, Flaget had the better claim and eventually Badin had to yield. Badin then
                    left the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> missions and returned to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> for a decade. But his heart was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and in Europe he became an active collector for the American missions and an agent for
                    Bishop Flaget and other western missionaries.</p>
            <p>His return to the American missions in 1828 and his re-establishment of the old Saint Joseph Mission,
                    north of the present city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is a remarkable postlude to his earlier mission career. Although then over sixty years
                    of age he showed remarkable physical vigor, riding horseback from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                        <region type="county">Fort Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to serve scattered Catholic families and remnants of Indian tribes. He bought the site
                    of the present University of Notre Dame and organized the first orphanage in the state of Indiana,
                    in 1834, under the direction of two religious women from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Sister Lucina Whitaker and Sister Magadalen Jackson. He soon gave up strenuous
                    missionary work, serving however in occasional priestly activities in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, until declining health forced his retirement. When he died in 1853 he was revered as
                    the most important missionary priest of the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>, as well as an
                    exemplary churchman. Handicapped by the loss of Father Badin's own papers, Herman
                    Schauinger has used the letters which this active missionary wrote to his superiors and friends in
                    order to trace the amazing career of this lonely figure to whom midwestern Catholicism owes so much.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> are strikingly delineated in the interesting correspondence of Dr. Francis Le Jau, who
                    was a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts from 1706 to
                    1717. In Le Jau's reports to his superiors and to his friends in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> considerable insight can be gained on the difficulties of colonial life in general and
                    upon the particular problems attendant upon a conscientious and intelligent clergyman.</p>
            <p>Le Jau often plaintively cited the chronic neglect of his parishioners who rarely provided him with
                    even the necessities of life and almost never the material equipment needed to carry on his
                    religious work. A man who brings his family to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Le Jau remarked, must expect to live on Indian corn, water, milk occasionally, and
                    meat once a week. Furthermore, his meager funds were ever rendered more inadequate by the runaway
                    inflation in the colony. Le Jau also had reason to bewail the frequent and devastating attacks of
                    fever from which he and his flock periodically suffered, and he depicted with simple but graphic
                    skill the real menace of the Indian wars and the discouragement and frustrations of isolation.</p>
            <p>In carrying out the objectives of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to shepherd the
                    Anglican fold and add converts from all three races of people in Carolina, Le Jau showed himself to
                    be an intelligent and indefatigable worker, although he encountered tremendous difficulties and
                    obstacles. Among the white settlers he found some who valiantly resisted his best efforts to work
                    for their spiritual improvement either because they were irreligious or because they were of
                    Calvinist or Anabaptist faith and would have none of his arguments, his tracts, or his persuasion.
                    Le Jau also noted that although he had instructed and baptized a number of Negroes, he found
                    considerable resistance from some slave-owners who feared that any instruction of the slaves would
                    be a prelude to their desire for emancipation. Le Jau, however, was firm in his belief that
                    Christianity <pb n="109" id="VAA4025-053-1-113"/> and slave-holding could exist satisfactorily side
                    by side. He did comment, though, that the continual influx of new slaves from the West Indies made
                    both his work and that of the slave-owners more difficult.</p>
            <p>Le Jau may have lacked insight into the eventual consequences of instructing the Negroes, but
                    certainly his whole life suggests that his failing was not a want of courage. Perhaps he did not
                    think through to its ultimate conclusions some of the implications of his teaching on the value of
                    the individual slave in the sight of God, but he had an admirable ability to see the immediate need
                    of the Negroes for moral and spiritual assistance. It should also be noted that Le Jau spoke out
                    boldly against the barbarous punishments which he saw inflicted upon the slaves, even though that
                    could not have been popular with his parishioners. Le Jau's letters furthermore indicated
                    remarkable interest in and understanding of both the Negro and the Indian. He felt, for example,
                    that Indian uprisings were in large part a result of the corrupt practices of the white traders, a
                    view he often reiterated. Le Jau dodged no issues when he saw an injustice. He was a man of great
                    moderation and balance.</p>
            <p>The observations of this keen and fair-minded man who showed such unbounded interest in everything
                    from inflation to Indian languages provide a valuable source for the study of colonial <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The footnotes and index of the volume are adequate and helpful, but perhaps the
                    introduction might have been a bit more complete in helping to set the scene for the correspondence.</p>

            <p>The twentieth century has inherited quite a variety of David Crocketts, as Walter Blair has recently
                    pointed out. At one extreme is the sentimentalized frontiersman (to whom this reviewer was
                    introduced in Youth's Companion stories some fifty years ago) who, in spite of all the
                    strongman <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-053-1-114"/> heroics that can be included, remains in his most
                    recent apotheosis just a figure of juvenile idealism. At the other is the ring-tailed roarer of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> settlements, a genuinely adult folktype, who became a master of electioneering
                    chicanery, was a vigorous brawler, and was sublimated to a demigod of American humor, who could grin
                    a coon out of a gumtree, thaw out a friz-up winter morning with bear oil, or swallow a bolt of
                    axletressity to explunctificate his passions. The second Davy has been brought to modern stature in
                    late years largely by such scholarly shaping as that of Constance Rourke. In between there have been
                    numerous variations playing from either extreme.</p>
            <p>The one Crockett who has always been uncertain is the historical one. Now comes a careful study by
                    Dr. James A. Shackford, lately of the English department of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> State College, with the assistance of his brother, Dr. John B. Shackford, professor of
                    English at Cornell College, to meet this need. The factual over-structure of Crockett's
                    life has long been well known, of course, ever since the so-called Autobiography of 1834 and other
                    contemporary accounts. This new study covers, as usual, Crockett's origins of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> frontier stock in eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, his youthful roles in the Creek War and the War of 1812, his several marriages, his
                    following the new-land border to western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, his proficiency as a hunter, and his popularity as a rough local humorist. There is a
                    rich account of his public services (touched with growing propensities toward gargantuan
                    exhibitionism) first as a local justice and commissioner, then as a state legislator, and finally as
                    a congressman; his fight to make the federal land laws serve the common settler; his vigorous
                    quarrel with Andrew Jackson; and finally his departure for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and his death in the siege of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1836. Professor Shackford's great service is in giving to all the related
                    fact and fiction accumulated during the past century and a half a discriminating and documented
                    sorting. Both the historical personage and the cherished myth have profited.</p>
            <p>Crockett's most important accomplishment as a public servant resulted from his long fight to
                    reform the federal land laws as they operated in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. As so often happened across America, the opening of new lands had been largely rigged
                    to benefit the pockets of wealthy investors. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> during the 1820's and 1830's it was largely a <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-053-1-115"/> problem of the so-called "vacant lands," less
                    desirable, unsettled parcels, especially in the western counties. These Crockett wanted released to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> where they could be sold to the poor at low rates, with the proceeds going to the
                    state's education fund. Crockett's long struggle ended in the failure of his bill,
                    his defeat in the 1835 election (with the whole-hearted animosity of President Jackson thrown in for
                    good measure), and his final disgusted departure not only from Congress but from the Union to seek a
                    new and better democracy in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>. Nevertheless, as Professor Shackford points out, Crockett's reforms
                    ultimately prevailed and it was his son John Wesley who pushed the measures in Congress in 1839 and
                    1841 that gave the lands at last to the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> to sell for 12½ cents an acre with preemption purchase rights. To all such
                    major episodes in Crockett's career, Dr. Shackford gives a painstaking historical reality.
                    The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName> finale in 1836 is especially well accomplished, this reviewer feels, with
                    Crockett's quixotic idealism and his bumptuous muscularity coming together into a pattern
                    of fact that is quite within the bounds of an understandable personality—coonskin cap,
                    rifle, and all.</p>
            <p>For historians of American regional literature, Shackford carefully untangles the bibliographical
                    snarls attending the authorship of the various "memoirs" that have long been
                    attributed to (but frequently could not have come from) the semi-literate pen of Davy. For
                    folklorists, he gives a discerning analysis of the "six primary factors" that he
                    has found working to create the legendary Crockett: "the imaginative temper of the
                    unsettled West; the imaginative temper of the settled East; the qualities of the man himself with
                    reference to the tempers of the time; the political parties, and their employment of a national
                    press to establish that symbol clearly in the minds and thoughts of a whole nation;
                    Crockett's dramatic death at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alamo</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which raised him to the level of a national martyr; and the pursuit by latter-day
                    writers of `Davy of the typescript'" (p. 241).</p>
            <p>Dr. Shackford is perhaps a bit too sensitive toward these last mentioned writers. True, in the recent
                    scurrying about for an American pantheon, scholars have tended to erect folk heroes in the image of
                    their own wish-thinking. But so it has always been whether in gleeman's songs or a college
                    professor's <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-053-1-116"/> manuscript. All are forces shaping the
                    popular concept. Dr. Shackford's contribution to the process through his careful fact
                    finding will not exorcise the folk-created Davy Crockett and replace him with a mere historical
                    reality. Instead, let us hope, it will provide the substance to help stabilize him as a worthy
                    symbol in which future generations will find continuing value.</p>
            <p>Four appendices discussing literary problems and the Crockett portraits, twenty-three pages of notes,
                    an eight-page bibliography, and a good index round out this valuable book.</p>

            <p>Let it be said at once that this is a book which had to be written, that it is written extremely
                    well, and that it deserves high priority on any list of required readings in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">American</region>
                    </placeName> historiography. I for one am deeply grateful to the author, and I have no doubt that my
                    gratitude is shared by a host of others in and out of the profession.</p>
            <p>Like many another scholarly work, this volume began as a doctoral dissertation (University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>). It was intended originally to be an intellectual biography of Carl Becker for the
                    primary purpose of explaining his historical relativism. But when the author discovered that she had
                    at her disposal all of Becker's research notes in addition to his correspondence and
                    manuscripts, she kept on enlarging the scope of her investigation until it assumed its final
                    proportions. While this is not the first study done on Becker, and while it is not likely to be the
                    last, it is certainly the best and the most comprehensive so far. Other studies will be made, no
                    doubt, and those who will make them will have to start where this volume leaves off.</p>
            <p>The life and work of Carl Lotus Becker is presented in three parts, although it is not arranged as
                    such—the man, the historian, the literary craftsman. Becker the teacher is by no means
                    neglected; he is always there, usually in the background, and from bits of information scattered <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-053-1-117"/> throughout the volume one gets a pretty good picture of his
                    performance in the classroom.</p>
            <p>The portrait of Becker the man is a warmly human estimate of a warmly human person. His life was
                    relatively uneventual and yet not without that high adventure of mind and spirit which is the most
                    exciting life of all. His character and personality are briefly, yet clearly sketched, in keeping
                    with the somewhat quaint description of him by Charles Homer Haskins: "a man of a rather
                    quiet and not forthputting disposition" (p. 18). In popular lingo, Becker was not a
                    "go-getter." He was essentially shy, modest, retiring, self-effacing, and with no
                    illusions about himself. These qualities were sometimes mistaken for remoteness, coolness, and even
                    snobbishness, but not by those who really knew him, and seldom by his better students. In fact,
                    those who knew him most intimately knew him as an "outgoing" person. He was always
                    concerned with the problems and troubles of others, and he was always generous to the less
                    fortunate. It was the kind of disposition easily associated with him by one who knows him only from
                    his writings.</p>
            <p>But it is primarily with Becker the historian that this volume is concerned. Unlike most other
                    historians, Becker did not wait to philosophize about history until he had to write presidential
                    addresses for learned societies. From the very beginning of his studies at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> under Turner and Haskins he speculated about the concept, nature, limitations,
                    possibilities, purposes, and goals of history. And this speculative interest increased with the
                    years until it became a consuming passion. What precisely is history? How are events as they are
                    remembered related to events as they actually happened? Are there two kinds of history, the history
                    that actually took place and the history that is created in the mind of the historian? Can these two
                    be brought together? Can history be a science? If so, in what sense? What about the methodology of
                    history? Can the historian learn anything for his craft from the methodology employed by the
                    "exact" sciences, say physics or biology ? Or must the historian devise a
                    methodology which is necessarily different because it is determined by the nature of his materials?
                    Can history be objective? These and many other related questions were always uppermost in his
                    thinking, and his answers to them constitute his principal contribution to historiography.</p>
            <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-053-1-118"/>
            <p>If, as someone has suggested, Becker may be called the American Ranke, it is not because of any
                    similarity between his approach to history and that of the "father of modern
                    historiography." It is rather because, like the great German historian, he exemplified a
                    tendency and helped spearhead a movement. Whereas Ranke's primary concern was with the past
                    "as it actually was," Becker's concern was primarily with the past as it
                    is remembered or reconstructed. To Ranke, the business of the historian was first and last to
                    establish the facts; to Becker, the historian's principal business was to understand what
                    was going on in his own mind as he went about establishing the facts, especially to be aware of the
                    "climate of opinion" in which he remembered or reconstructed the past. Becker
                    attempted to show that it can never be a science, at least not in any narrow sense. History cannot
                    foretell the future; all it can do is to help us meet the future. To be sure, objectivity and
                    detachment must be cultivated to the utmost, and Becker cultivated them successfully beyond most
                    other historians. Research must be carried on most vigorously and with a scrupulous regard to the
                    laws of evidence, and he was a most careful and thorough researcher. But he believed that, in the
                    final analysis, history is an art rather than a science, albeit a highly specialized art and one
                    which calls for the most rigorous discipline. At best, he considered history to be a personal
                    affirmation about the past, always a partial and tentative affirmation and always reflecting the
                    "climate of opinion" in which it is made. In a word, like Thucydides, he regarded
                    history as "philosophy taught by means of example."</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most valuable contribution of this study is the careful, well documented inquiry into the
                    nature of Becker's relativism. Becker was a controversial figure, and for the most part the
                    controversy revolved about his relativistic view of history. The author does not claim originality
                    for Becker in this respect, but she insists that he was "one of the first American
                    historians to apply the relativist conception to history" (p. 104). Another one was Charles
                    Beard, but Beard's relativism, it is pointed out, was considerably different from
                    Becker's in both kind and degree. Whereas Beard deliberately chose a "frame of
                    reference and wrote accordingly," usually with strong conviction and feeling, <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-053-1-119"/> Becker was satisfied to know that he could not get away completely from
                    his "climate of opinion," that, in other words, his judgments and values would
                    reflect his personal biases, assumptions, and his total cultural conditioning. The author sums it
                    all up, felicitously, in one sentence: "Becker's relativism is a modest philosophy
                    akin to Justice Holmes' conception of truth as `the system of my limitations'
                    " (p. 120).</p>
            <p>There are two chapters which at first sight may seem to some to be superfluous, chapter four,
                    "The Art of Writing," and chapter five, "The Practice of
                    Writing." But upon getting into the first of these it becomes clear at once that the author
                    has done well to include them. In fact, these two chapters deserve serious study by anyone who
                    wishes to write history. Becker was not only a scholarly historian, one who knew how to carry on the
                    most painstaking research; he was also one of this country's outstanding literary
                    historians. In fact, he is considered by many to be our most brilliant writer of history. It is safe
                    to predict that for generations to come his books will be read, if only for the beauty and charm of
                    their literary quality. In the second of the chapters referred to the author does something quite
                    unusual. She shows Becker at work by comparing word for word specimen drafts of some of his
                    manuscripts. One can almost see him struggling for the precise term, the happy phrase, the accurate
                    wording, and all that goes into a finished literary product. These two chapters could be extremely
                    helpful to all who aspire to write well, history or anything else.</p>

                    </placeName> University which Professor Craven delivered in 1955. It is not, <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-053-1-120"/> as its title might suggest, an exercise in iconoclasm. If anything,
                    Professor Craven somewhat surprisingly lends his well-cultured voice to the chorus of those
                    historians from Samuel Eliot Morison to Alan Simpson who are busily rehabilitating the reputation of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The author's purpose, however, in these lectures is not so much to argue
                    either for or against the soundness of American legendary history as to describe its development.
                    This he does with a wealth of illustrative detail from an amazing variety of source materials.
                    Professor Craven traces the legend of the Founding Fathers to its roots, not only in the writings of
                    our relatively uncritical early historians, but in sermons, tracts, political pamphlets, orations,
                    the activities of patriotic and ancestor-worshiping societies, and that most American of all
                    historical phenomena—the anniversary celebrations. As a by-product of this exploration,
                    he gives his readers an excellent bibliography of little-known Americana. In spite of wandering
                    rather far afield, however, Professor Craven does not mention such legend makers as Parson Weems and
                    Nathaniel Hawthorne, who had much more to do with the shaping of America's concept of its
                    own history than did George Bancroft.</p>
            <p>In his first lecture, Professor Craven discusses the origins of American tradition in regard to its
                    own history during the colonial period when the principal concern was the question "Why
                    came we here?" and the inspired answer, "To seek liberty—religious and
                    political," became firmly rooted in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">American</region>
                    </placeName> consciousness. His second lecture deals with the contributions of this tradition to the
                    polemics of the Revolutionary period, when it served to bolster the argument that Americans were
                    seeking only to preserve what they had originally crossed the Atlantic to find. The third lecture
                    traces the growth of the varying colonial traditions (Roger Williams, for example, was originally
                    regarded very differently in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName>) into a more or less common, national hagiography, with the Fourth of July serving as a
                    bond of union between peoples who still differed over their celebrations of Christmas and
                    Thanksgiving. The last three lectures deal for the most part with the ways in which racial groups,
                    societies, and patriotic organizations have encrusted the Legend of the Founding Fathers and how the
                    legend has been first battered and then refurbished in the <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-053-1-121"/>
                    twentieth century. These last chapters make easier reading than the first, but they are less
                    rewarding.</p>
            <p>Lectures are designed to be heard, not read, and the criteria for judging them in print cannot be
                    quite the same as for other books. Professor Craven's lectures are peppered with
                    ear-catching and thought-provoking phrases (for example, "It is a remarkable fact that the
                    American who finds himself rejected as an American quarrels not so much with the test by which he is
                    rejected as with the proposition that he cannot meet the test" p. 109), but on the whole
                    they do not emerge as readily digestible prose. There are such flat contradictions as that on page
                    176 where it is first said of James Truslow Adams that "For the old heroes, he offered new
                    ones," then five lines later that he, "Like other idol smashers… showed
                    little inclination to set up new ones." This may, of course, be a typographical error, like
                    the two which appear in footnote 90, p. 117 (Merle Curtis rather than Curti, and <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American History,</hi> where <hi rend="i">Biography</hi> is obviously intended).
                    Aside from a very few slips (Isaac Backus preached in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> rather than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, p. 79) Professor Craven's scholarship is impeccable, and his theme full of
                    challenging suggestions. In an area of such unlimited vistas, however, it is difficult to avoid
                    resort to doubtful generalizations and proof which sometimes denies rather than supports.</p>
            <p>One of the great American historians whom Craven rightly treats as a deflator of the Founding Fathers
                    was the late Charles McLean Andrews, a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut Yankee</region>
                    </placeName> in King Ranke's court for more than fifty years. Andrews first dedicated
                    himself to the cause of "scientific history" through the inspiration of Herbert
                    Baxter Adams at Johns Hopkins and Frederick William Maitland in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. According to Eisenstadt, he was a tireless cruader at Bryn Mawr, Johns Hopkins, and,
                    for thirty-three years at Yale, under that banner with the strange device, <hi rend="i">wie es
                        eigentlich gewesen.</hi> Together with Herbert Levi Osgood and George Louis Beer, he founded the
                    "imperial school" and put back the "colonial" into American
                    colonial history. He saved incalculable man-hours of labor for future historians by publishing his
                    three-volume <hi rend="i">Guide to the Materials for American History to 1783</hi> in the Public
                    Record Office, the British Museum, and various other British archives. He wrote a series of
                    scholarly and <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-053-1-122"/> incisive books on English and American history,
                    and, during the last decade of his life, capped a brilliant career of research and synthesis by
                    publishing his <hi rend="i">summa historica,</hi> the four volume <hi rend="i">Colonial Period of
                        American History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, and something more, is told in considerable detail, with brilliant exposition and a
                    slightly euphemistic style (of which my preceding paragraph is a deliberate imitation) in Mr.
                    Eisenstadt's study. Although it contains biographical facts, it is not a biography of
                    Professor Andrews, and while it discusses his writings at some length it is not by any means a
                    complete analysis of them. It is, rather, an essay on the Rankean influence in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">American</region>
                    </placeName> historiography, particularly upon the study of American colonial history with special
                    reference to the writings of Andrews. As such, it is a worthy, even though somewhat soporific and
                    highly inflated piece of work. The author not only knows the writings of Andrews intimately, which
                    is no small accomplishment, but he writes competently of works by Maitland, Stubbs, Bancroft, Adams,
                    Beer, Channing, Fisher, Greene, Jameson, Jernegan, Osgood, Root, Tyler, Van Tyne, Beard,
                    Bridenbaugh, Dickerson, Gipson, Harper, Labaree, Morison, and Schlesinger. His best chapters are
                    probably the last two, 7 and 8, in which he discusses these various contemporaries of Andrews.</p>
            <p>In spite of the obvious competence of the author, this book will probably contribute little to those
                    who are already acquainted with the works of Andrews. In fact, it will probably annoy them by its
                    insistent repetitions, even of the same quotations, and its gross exaggeration both of the
                    importance and of the intensity of Andrews' fight on behalf of "scientific
                    history." Even the most dedicated "relativist" today would heartily
                    concur in Andrews' insistence upon a thorough examination of the evidence of every side of
                    the question, and few colonial historians would quarrel with the validity of his new perspective in
                    the period prior to 1783 (or even later). Eisenstadt recognizes that Andrews himself often failed to
                    keep the new perspective in focus—that he found it easier to preach a cause in his
                    preface than to practice it in his text. For this very reason, because Andrews was actually less
                    wedded to Leopold von Ranke than Eisenstadt seems to think, his great <hi rend="i">Colonial Period
                        of American History</hi> will appear upon the reading lists of American history courses for a
                    long time to come. Between the disciples of <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-053-1-123"/> Croce, who profess
                    to believe that no histories (except their own, perhaps) will outlast the generation which produced
                    them, and the followers of Ranke, who thought that a history of absolute and eternal value could be
                    written, a humble votary of Clio may prefer to pronounce a plague on both their houses and read them
                    all for whatever they can give him.</p>

            <p>Although this book contains an annotated list of over four hundred American autobiographies, Mr.
                    Lillard makes it clear at the outset that he is not working in the service of "experts in
                    research." "It is my intention," he writes in his "Note on
                    Purpose and Method," "that this descriptive guide be useful to present day readers
                    of all sorts who consult lists of books and welcome annotations. This is a selected list of general
                    interest of books that I have read and thought worth someone else's
                    time—granting wide variations in taste and reading skill." Mr. Lillard deals
                    primarily with twentieth century American autobiographies (including twentieth century editions and
                    reprints of older books); one of his prime requisites for listing a book is its availability:
                    "I have wanted to list books that are available, that library patrons can get hold
                    of." He has "ignored autobiographies, however good," that have not been
                    published in "complete, separate volumes," for he realizes that "only
                    graduate students with their eyes on degrees will look up such material." He has annotated
                    only books which he has read; he admits candidly that he has not mentioned books which he
                    "never heard of."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lillard groups the autobiographies under broad occupational headings such as "Actors and
                    Show People," "Doctors," "Musicians," and
                    "Society Leaders." (He shrewdly lists Polly Adler's <hi rend="i">A House
                        is Not a Home</hi> under "Businessmen, Financiers, Industrialists"). In his
                    introductory essay he sets forth criteria of judging autobiography: formula writing, details of
                    trips, racing too fast, name dropping, and <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-053-1-124"/> covering up are some
                    of the "ways of going wrong"; a consistent point of view, a frame of reference,
                    "sadness: admission of error and failure," "empathy from the
                    start," and "a sense of progression or change" are ways of going right.
                    He then annotates in terms of these criteria.</p>
            <p>"In compiling my working list," writes Mr. Lillard, "I used several
                    bibliographies of autobiography, plus my own accumulated notes, but mostly—and
                    repeatedly—I followed a system of examining the books on the shelves of
                    libraries." We may at this point question the value of such a "system"
                    and of what has resulted from it. Mr. Lillard does not pretend to bibliographical thoroughness even
                    for twentieth century American autobiography; he has given data "on editions and
                    reprintings" only as these "came to hand." Is he, then, interested only
                    in sharing with "readers of all sorts" the results of his personal readings in
                    autobiography and in aiding their judgment with a set of elementary criteria of good and bad? Is his
                    self-imposed job that of passing on the interesting things he has encountered in his readings?</p>
            <p>Insofar as the answer to these questions is yes the book assumes the nature of a browser's
                    corner, neat and orderly to be sure, but only of chance value. A more accurate title would be <hi rend="i">A Descriptive Guide to Some American Autobiographies I Have Read.</hi> But the book
                    will serve in a more predictable way. Mr. Lillard's earlier <hi rend="i">America in
                    Fiction</hi> (which he compiled together with Otis W. Coan) was "designed to aid students
                    of American civilization—adults using the facilities of public libraries, college
                    undergraduates, and young people in the eleventh and twelfth grades." Mr.
                    Lillard's "readers of all sorts who consult lists of books and welcome
                    annotations" is, basically, the same group. The book will aid these people: it will be
                    regarded as indispensable by the high school senior and college undergraduate with certain kinds of
                    research papers to write, by the adult whose study group hands him an assignment on American artists
                    or musicians. But it will seem indispensable to these people precisely as a tool of research. <hi rend="i">American Life in Autobiography</hi> will be to the amateur researcher what a thorough
                    bibliography is to the graduate student and expert. It is thus unfortunate that Mr. Lillard writes
                    off the work of the expert as "recondite" and mentions the research of graduate
                    students as if it involves worlds other than the one we all <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-053-1-125"/>
                    live in. If he is doing anything more than presenting a browser's corner he ought to
                    demonstrate belief and seek to arouse interest in the idea of research. We cannot all be graduate
                    students and experts, but we can respect their work if we are properly instructed, if we are made to
                    understand its relevance. It is regrettable that Mr. Lillard feels no responsibility to promote even
                    the beginning of such an understanding.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Lillard suggests that he has an interest in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">American</region>
                    </placeName> autobiography beyond what we have been discussing here. In his introductory essay he
                    seeks to see autobiography as a vital part of American historical life. "The better
                    American autobiographies," he writes, "are structured around a perception of
                    change on two levels, the social on one and the personal and intellectual on the other." He
                    tries, in short, to explain the nature of American autobiography as something that will let us know
                    more fully the nature of our national character. Unfortunately, he does not develop such an
                    explanation, potentially a matter of great significance. Would that each section or grouping in the
                    book had an accompanying essay in which Mr. Lillard examined the image that the representative
                    autobiographies present to us—the self-image of the public official, the religious
                    leader, the social worker, the artist. Would that we could see defined the variations on the central
                    theme of change as they exist in the autobiographies of each group. Would that we had a historical
                    survey tracing the development of the self-image of any one of these groups. For these are things we
                    need to know, things which would enable us to deal with autobiography more surely and more
                    intelligently than we do now.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lillard takes no more than a first step toward seeing American autobiography as a functioning
                    part of American life. He does not attempt to go further. But in taking the first step as if it
                    might, after all, be the whole journey, he leaves us with the certain knowledge of how far he did
                    not go.</p>

            <p>The much overused word <hi rend="i">nostalgia</hi> best describes this little volume of delightful
                    reading, whether it is viewed by one in his youth or by one who has reached the age when memories
                    are more important. It is an account of ancestors and descendants. In the words of the author,
                    "Now that I am a grandmother I know, too, what descendants really are. <hi rend="i">Ancestors, descendants</hi>—the dry, parchmentlike flavor, associated with
                    genealogical records has been removed from both words for me" (p. 245).</p>
            <p>Miss Marshall carries us through the generation of people, through the development of the farm home
                    and community, and through the vicissitudes of history with such clarity that we feel that we are
                    actually living the experiences that she relates. It is not a bewailing of "the good old
                    days" that are best but an appreciation of both past and present. Let her speak again:</p>
            <p>"Descendants are babies. Descendants are people who come into the world as individuals with
                    whom we are not yet acquainted. Immediately they set about developing into endearing folks with
                    cuddly, funny ways. When I have been looking into the eyes of my grandbabies, I have wished my
                    parents might have enjoyed them too, for they would have loved them so. From that point I have gone
                    on to bestow pity upon my ancestors. They missed so much of which they did not dream, because they
                    could not know the babies who are arriving in the pulsing present" (p. 245).</p>
            <p>The picture presented runs all the way from the cabin and fireplace, presided over by an ex-slave
                    woman of uncanny knowledge, through the building and the subsequent rebuilding of the newer
                    permanent homestead down to the modern leave-taking of the old place for an abode in an urban
                    center. It is typical of the Hoosier scene. We see the black-silk gowned, severe appearing ancestral
                    ladies of the household as they stare down from their frames, long after black silk and severity are
                    only memories. We can hear the clanking of the chain and the dripping of the water as the bucket is
                    cranked up from the depths of the well, and we long for it after the well has gone dry and a more
                    modern method has been installed. We suddenly realize that grandmother's <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-053-1-127"/> fireplace dinners are no longer part of daily living and that now
                    better cooking is served from a cooking stove. Then we are suddenly brought to the realization that
                    "stove personalities" all over the house, those stoves that we both loved and
                    feared, are also gone, and in their places only the whirring of the fan that keeps the place so
                    evenly and comfortably heated.</p>
            <p>A visit to the sugar camp during the February molasses run, as Miss Marshall describes it, is an
                    experience to remember. The sap had to be collected and boiled to exactly the right degree of
                    density for molasses or wax or that tasty delicacy, maple sugar candy.</p>
            <p>Even the domestic diplomacy that the wife and mother had to use in managing the household to which
                    she had been brought as a bride brings either a smile or a frown to the reader, depending on his own
                    experience and memories, as do the fussy uncles, the exacting aunts, and the unchangeable pictures
                    and pieces of furniture.</p>
            <p>This fascinating account of memories runs through wheat fields, larkspur, weddings, fine riding
                    horses, and the entire galaxy of possessions and experiences that made Hoosier life of past
                    generations complete and satisfying. Just climb into the surrey with the family as they leave the
                    old homestead and try to catch some of the emotion they experienced as they drove away, never to
                    return with the same intimate relationship of coming home. Father "handed the
                    reins" to another man, and the surrey jolted down the hill and out of the gate as one era
                    ended and another began.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">I, Alone, Remember</hi> is a worthwhile addition to the collection of personal memoirs
                    and to the folksy accounts of the middle period of Hoosier life. Our ancestry is not an object of
                    apology; on the contrary, it is to be proudly remembered as the foundation on which our present day
                    culture rests.</p>

                    Professor William B. Hesseltine's <hi rend="i">Pioneer's Mission, the Story of
                        Lyman Copeland Draper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lyman C. Draper (1815–1891) started out as a young historian interested chiefly in the
                    pioneer West. Instinctively, it seems, he searched for the personal correspondence, diaries, other
                    accounts and manuscripts of pioneers which still remained in private hands. The numerous instances
                    of loss or destruction led him to consider the collecting or rescuing of such materials to be a
                    pioneer historian's mission. For many years he was a godsend to the Society.</p>
            <p>"Draper's Predecessors and Contemporaries," by Lyman H. Butterfield, is
                    mainly concerned with Lyman Draper's chief fellow workers, correspondents, and friendly
                    rivals, who were "brothers of a peculiar but devoted order … rescuing and
                    recording the facts, the lore too, of America's past," as Butterfield frankly
                    states. And he goes on to say that "most of them were New Englanders or of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">New England</country>
                    </placeName> stock." Whatever one's biases may be, the paper deserves considerate
                    reading. Draper's knowledge of collectors and their work may well have been more extensive.</p>
            <p>"The Modern Collector," by Roy P. Basler, discusses both private and institutional
                    collectors. He fears that among them there is "too little concern" for materials
                    of recent origin. Certainly; but the institutional collector either specializes or tries to maintain
                    a proper balance with due regard for budget and space, and in the latter case should be on his guard
                    against enthusiasts, partisans, or propagandists who would stuff his repository. Dr. Basler suggests
                    also that institutions concentrate on acquiring photocopies rather than on bidding up prices of
                    original manuscripts which have a special appeal to private collectors. He might agree that one
                    should consider each manuscript on its individual merits as an historical document, calculate the
                    risk of eventual loss or destruction, and if necessary seek a donor of sufficient means to bring it
                    at once into institutional custody. Dr. Basler's account of his own experiences in
                    collecting Abraham Lincoln manuscripts is a contribution which everyone should read.</p>
            <p>"The <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Experiments," by Donald R. McNeil, is excellent, and is especially suggestive
                    in its references to the <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-053-1-129"/> Society's success in
                    obtaining group co-operation and funds for the business, labor, and medical history projects.</p>
            <p>The banquet address, "The Draper Manuscripts," by Miss Alice E. Smith, is far from
                    being merely a descriptive catalogue. It is an accurate and comprehensive, eloquent and eulogistic
                    review of Lyman C. Draper's career and achievements, as well as an impressive general
                    description of Draper's accumulations both private and institutional. Her story of the
                    utility of the collections during the last sixty years is amazing, and her disclosure of the
                    possibilities of future use is well worth the historian's attention.</p>
            <p>Let us have more such historical society celebrations and reviews without necessarily waiting for
                    centennials.</p>

            <p>Agricultural developments in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> during the initial half of the nineteenth century were in many respects similar to
                    those in Indiana for the same period. In both states farming was highly diversified and land
                    holdings were widely diffused. Moreover, a new peak of agricultural prosperity was reached in these
                    commonwealths during the decade of the 1850's when the overwhelming proportion of their
                    people was still engaged in farming. The similarity of agriculture in the Hoosier and the Tar Heel
                    states can easily be exaggerated; nevertheless it was considerable, especially in the first quarter
                    of the century when many North Carolinians joined with numerous others from the southern Piedmont in
                    becoming the principal element among the early pioneers of Indiana.</p>
            <p>Professor Cathey has emphasized evidences and manifestations of agricultural progress, but he has
                    also presented the broad outlines of an agricultural history. Following the Revolution, according to
                    Professor Cathey, the farmers of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> had been even more backward than farmers in other states. At first agricultural
                    progress was slow and <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-053-1-130"/> spotty, but it gained momentum during the
                    thirties, forties, and fifties as it did for the nation as a whole. <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>'s ante-bellum progress doubtless would have come earlier and would have been
                    more pronounced had it not been for geographical factors which retarded the development of a
                    transportation system, the lack of which in turn retarded agricultural advancement.</p>
            <p>During the first quarter of the nineteenth century a small number of farmers and planters led in
                    fostering agricultural improvement. Progress was encouraged through experimentations, agricultural
                    periodicals, farm almanacs, agricultural societies, and agricultural fairs. In addition, inventions
                    and technological developments furthered agrarian improvement as did the gradual increase in
                    knowledge regarding the composition and uses of soils, breeding practices and seed selection,
                    improved methods of cultivation, and the like. Moreover, agricultural progress gained momentum in
                    the generation preceding the Civil War partly because of advances in public education and
                    transportation facilities in this period.</p>
            <p>Though slavery became more widely diffused in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName> between the Revolution and the Civil War, the average size of agricultural holdings
                    decreased. Furthermore, at the end of the period the greater portion of Tar Heel farmers owned no
                    slaves, while among those who did about half of them owned fewer than five apiece. Only 133 persons
                    owned more than one hundred slaves. The farm, not the plantation, dominated ante-bellum life in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (pp. 48–49, 52–53). The reviewer, however, searched in vain for
                    evidence of the impact the institution of slavery might have had on the rate of agricultural
                    improvement.</p>
            <p>This readable study has substantial documentation and an adequate index. Similar studies are needed
                    for numerous other states, including Indiana. The University of <placeName>
