            <p>Dorothy L. Riker enjoyed a remarkably productive fifty-year career as an historian and editor for the
                    Indiana Historical Bureau and Indiana Historical Society. For reasons that bear some exploring,
                    Riker, with her fellow editors Nellie Armstrong Robertson and Gayle Thornbrough, exercised
                    considerable influence over what was published in Indiana history during that period
                        (1929—1979).<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Riker's life raises interesting questions
                    about the opportunities and constraints encountered by the first generation of Indiana women to
                    receive professional training in history,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> a group who were also among the first
                    generation of American women to come to adulthood after World War I and the enfranchisement of
                    women. Their rapid disappearance from our midst prompts this preliminary effort to understand their
                    historical significance in general and that of Dorothy Riker in particular.</p>

                            first males received their M.A.'s in 1890. There were, however, very few women

                    in her life. Her mother died when she was fourteen. Her sister married and left the country. Her
                    father's remarriage, after his daughters went away to college, precipitated a permanent

            <p>The popular culture of the 1920s pressured young women to reject their mothers’ model of
                    adulthood in exchange for sexual adventurousness, an intensified emphasis on professional attention
                    to physical appearance (beauty salons for haircuts, permanent waves, makeup), and economic
                    independence. Riker's homegrown, small-town, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> character rejected the flapper model; the red-haired senior in the 1926 <hi rend="i">Arbutus</hi> has a rather grim look about her and a slightly truculent jaw. But she was clearly
                    headed for economic independence. Her rather heroic course of study centered around her history
                    major, but she also equipped herself to teach mathematics and history at the high school level.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riker took her first history course in her second year, when she accelerated her pace of study. After
                    an introductory semester studying southern history with William O. Lynch and the general <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history course with Albert L. Kohlmeier, she enrolled in four history courses the
                    second semester; included were the second halves of the medieval and modern history surveys and the
                    Greek and Roman history course. She took six more history courses the next year, four of them with
                    F. Lee Benns in modern European history (including a two-semester "seminary"). She
                    was clearly enthusiastic about history and did consistently excellent work in it. The question was
                    how she could make a living doing it.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Public education was a rapidly expanding part of the American economy in the 1920s, a trend that
                    reflected both an enormous increase in the national population in preceding decades and the
                    increasing use of public high schools to prepare an expanding middle class for business and
                    professional careers. Riker's intention to become a high school history and mathematics
                    teacher was both shrewd and fairly ambitious, but she rather quickly decided it was not ambitious
                    enough. She taught history and government at Frankton High School, not far from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Elwood</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for one year; but she decided it did not suit her and went back to the university for
                    graduate work in history instead.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not obvious what Riker's professional goals were when she went to graduate school to
                    study history. Perhaps she was "testing the waters," contemplating the possibility of a

                    more prestigious high school than Frankton's. In any event she was part of a remarkable
                    surge in women's pursuit of graduate studies in history in the 1920s. Nationally, women
                    earned almost 22 percent of the doctorates awarded in history in the 1920s, a proportion that
                    remained unequaled until recent decades. Although Indiana University granted no doctorate in history
                    to a woman until 1934 (and relatively few to men before then), women earned 37 percent of the
                    master's degrees awarded in history at I.U. between 1928 and 1935, more women in that

            <p>Riker received encouragement from the history department in her decision to return to graduate

                            woman to earn a Ph.D. in history at Indiana University; her 1934 dissertation was

                            Only sixteen men had earned the Ph.D. at Indiana by 1935. Women earned 41 of the 104
                            master's degrees awarded in history between 1921 and 1930 and 39 of the 108

                            disappearance of men from graduate school during World War II, women earned 22 of 43
                            master's degrees in history awarded at I.U. between 1941 and 1945. Only after World

                            to men's. In the 1950s women earned only 16 percent of the advanced degrees awarded
                            in history at I.U., and this figure dwindled to 11 percent in the 1960s. I.U. Library,

                    Riker's graduate work for the master's degree was focused on America and modern
                    Europe; she took only one course (a seminar in medieval history) outside the modern Atlantic area.
                    She continued to study with Benns, who probably oversaw her thesis on "<placeName>

                    </placeName>'s Relation to Europe, 1912-14" and took courses with Kohlmeier, Lynch, William
                    T. Morgan, Logan Esarey, and John C. Andressohn. Her work was deemed consistently excellent by
                    everyone with whom she studied (she was one of 37 out of 204 graduate students in the university to
                    receive all A's the first semester), and she was awarded a master's degree June
                    11, 1928. She immediately enrolled in two more history courses in summer school.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did she contemplate a Ph.D.? She was still receiving support from the history department (an

                    however, her course work for her second year in graduate school suggests some indecision. She seemed
                    briefly to have considered an advanced degree in education (she took four courses in education the
                    first semester and only one in history) but did not follow this up. Riker was obviously at a
                    crossroads in 1928-1929, not sure what to do next. She was a successful and resourceful student,
                    with a growing self-confidence and worldliness. (It is with a small shock that one who knew her as
                    an older woman learns that in 1929 the young Dorothy was the featured final speaker at the History
                    and Political Science Club annual banquet, where she spoke on "George <placeName>

                    assistantships and by tutoring football players. Did she aspire to teach in a college if one could
                    have been found to hire her? I have no evidence with which to answer the question. What <hi rend="i">was</hi> found for Riker was a job she later described as "the best job in the world":

                    Department, which had a strong program in researching and collecting state history, and the
                    venerable and elite (but small) Indiana Historical Society (IHS), based in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The university's principal researcher in Indiana history, Professor Logan
                    Esarey, made a bid to have the IHC transferred to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> under his part-time direction. Such a move would have been in line with other
                    midwestern historical agencies, which generally had strong connections with state universities. But
                    Esarey faced a formidable obstacle: the commission had just appointed a new director, the
                    well-connected Christopher B. Coleman, long-time IHS member, professionally trained historian
                    (Ph.D., <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName>), and experienced administrator. Coleman and Esarey were a study in contrasts: the
                    former, with his Yale background and family heritage of professional status, was a midwestern
                    aristocrat; the latter was a small-town Hoosier, I.U.'s first Ph.D. in history, as rumpled
                    and rustic as Coleman was graceful and urbane.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Coleman had also been elected
                    IHS executive secretary in 1924, and the influential Society was not prepared to see the commission

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, thus depriving Coleman of the leadership of the state's historical work.
                    Esarey's proposal was rejected; instead of the IHC's moving to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was consolidated with the Indiana State Library and renamed the Indiana Historical

            </p>
            <p>Esarey lost more than his bid for the IHC in 1925. As a consequence of a dispute with Coleman and the
                    new Bureau's editor, Nellie C. Armstrong, whom Coleman hired to oversee the Indiana
                    Historical Collections series, Esarey ultimately lost his editorship of the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> and his venue for publishing Indiana documentary editions.</p>
            <p>Armstrong (1896-1982) had worked under the prolific academic editors Clarence W. Alvord and Theodore

                    Esarey, angered that his work was subjected to correction by his rival Coleman and by a woman whose
                    scholarly credentials were inferior to his own, refused to accept editorial changes. Coleman stood
                    behind his editor, and after harsh words and the intrusion of legal opinions about the ownership of
                    the manuscript, Esarey's work was returned to him, unpublished, in 1927. The I.U. professor
                    had won a pyrrhic victory in his refusal to accept the Bureau's editorial supervision of
                    his work.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Esarey subsequently failed to persuade the university to discontinue the IMH's
                    connection with the Coleman-run Society, which constituted the IMH's principal base of
                    subscribers, his resignation as editor was accepted as of the end of 1927. His colleagues had
                    decided that Esarey had become an obstacle to the goal of better relations between the university
                    and the Buread/Society. For Esarey it must have been a crushing blow. He lost control both of the
                    magazine he had brought to the forefront of state history journals during his editorship (1913-1927)
                    and of the governors’ papers series he had inaugurated for the IHC.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Coleman hired Riker as the IHB research assistant a year and a half after Esarey edited his last
                    issue of the IMH. Coleman probably asked Lynch, the new editor of the magazine, to recommend
                    someone—he probably specified a woman—to work as Armstrong's research
                    assistant in the Bureau's Indiana Historical Collections series. Coleman's request
                    was probably intended and perceived as a peace offering. Riker was undoubtedly the best candidate
                    for the job. She was an outstanding graduate student who had worked successfully with virtually
                    everyone in the Indiana University department. She had studied midwestern history with Esarey, who
                    could recommend her both professionally and personally, since he also knew her as the good friend
                    and roommate of his niece Essa Maria Esarey, of Oriole, Indiana (who was also doing graduate work
                    and who remained Riker's lifelong friend).<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>It was an unusually serendipitous match. Riker found a mission. The impecunious Bureau found a
                    selfless, joyful worker who was also a well-trained and talented historian. And Indiana University
                    had installed one of its own in the IHB. Dorothy Riker was the university's gift to the
                    Bureau. When I suggested this interpretation of the meaning of Dorothy's coming to the
                    Bureau, Hubert H. Hawkins, Bureau/Society leader from 1953 to 1976, offered a pleasing analogy with
                    Homeric wars: Dorothy was a sort of princess from <placeName>

                    of identification with the I.U. department; in the aftermath of her estrangement from her father,
                    the history department became a sort of family for her, as she acknowledged several decades later in
                    a tribute to Kohlmeier: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote> In October, 1930, Coleman wrote to the Indiana State Library and Historical Bureau,
                    "we ought by all means to retain Miss Riker as she is a real
                    ‘find."’ In November Lynch ended a reply to a letter from Riker,

            <p>Riker found her life's work in 1929 just in time to be sheltered from the long storm of the

                    enterprise, and publishing them was among the chief duties of historical agencies such as the
                    Bureau. Riker was trained in historical editing by Armstrong.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>

            <p>It is not clear how much Coleman involved himself in his editorial staffs work, but circumstantial
                    evidence would suggest it was not much. He was an overworked man for most of his tenure with the
                    Bureau, especially during the six-year period when he was running the State Library (1936-1942) in
                    addition to running the Bureau and the Society.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> He usually signed the
                    introductions to the Collections volumes. He was often the official correspondent with authors. But
                    Coleman's name never appeared as editor on any of the Collections publications, and it
                    seems unlikely, with Armstrong and Riker on his staff, that he did more than act as official
                    correspondent to save the dignity of authors reluctant to accept the authority of women.</p>
            <p>Coleman, a seasoned executive, chose his editorial staff carefully and expressed strong confidence in
                    them. The result was a tradition of strong editors with unusual autonomy. Coleman observed in the

                    Coleman himself ready to delegate authority to his editors, this left them a somewhat free hand. The
                    Bureau's editors also had strong support from the Indiana Historical Society's
                    publications committee, which by the 1940s included Armstrong. While there were some high-powered,
                    vivid personalities on the committee, both professionals and amateurs with strong interests in
                        history—<hi rend="i">e.g.</hi>, Herman B Wells, Lyman Ayres, Eli Lilly, John D.
                    Barnhart, and John P. Goodwin, all served on the committee at various times—they were
                    consistently responsive to the editors' recommendations about what to publish. Hawkins
                    recalled recently that he believed the committee had never failed to approve a project recommended

            </p>
            <p>The Indiana women editors' relative autonomy reflected several circumstances. First, the
                    women were unusually capable persons. As Hawkins put it recently, "The editors were good
                    historians who had weight appropriate to their merit." (He went on to describe them as the
                    dominant factors in the publishing program.) Like Riker, Thornbrough was an outstanding
                    student—in her case, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in graduate work at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. As for Riker, by the 1950s it was clear that no one knew Indiana history better than
                    she; her command of the documentary sources and secondary literature of state history and her
                    knowledge of the resources of the State Library were unique. Everyone who did research on an Indiana
                    topic was advised to "check with Dorothy Riker" to make sure that no sources were overlooked. She
                    was notably generous with her knowledge; she did not see herself as a competitor with the scholars
                    who sought her out. Together, in her view, they were serving a larger end, a search for knowledge
                    and understanding.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riker and Thornbrough's domination of Indiana state history publishing also reflected Bureau
                    directors' confidence in the two women. Like his predecessor Howard H. Peckham, Hawkins
                    respected their judgment. He noted recently that the editors were often influential even in
                    determining which projects were undertaken in the first place since prospective authors would
                    discuss ideas with one or both of them before undertaking research and would consult with them at
                    various stages of manuscript preparation. <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-091-3-018"/> In decisions about which documents to publish, again the
                    editors chiefly determined the agenda, in consultation with the Bureau director. Hawkins recalled
                    three-way discussions with the editors, brainstorming publications possibilities. He urged
                    publishing materials with greater popular interest than the traditional governors' papers,
                    but the major say in determining publication belonged to the women editors.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The largest factor explaining the women's opportunity to shape publications in Indiana
                    history was the resistance of the Bureau/ Society to accepting the leadership of the academic
                    historians in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Esarey, as noted, lost his bid to move the Bureau to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1925. President Herman B Wells and I.U. History Department head and Society
                    executive committee member Kohlmeier made another unsuccessful effort to acquire the Bureau in 1944,
                    after Coleman's death. The insistence of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> leaders of the Society that the Bureau remain in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> preserved the women editors' autonomy, as well as preserving the powerful
                    influence of the Society's amateur historian board members. While the executive committee
                    was prepared to give lip service to the notion that the Bureau/Society should consult with the
                    history department about editing and publishing material in Indiana history, in fact the women
                    editors—Armstrong and Riker, until Armstrong's retirement in 1947, and then
                    Riker and Thornbrough—continued to play the major role in editing and publishing Indiana
                    historical monographs and documents.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At times, the relationship between the university and the Bureau was somewhat tense. It is likely,
                    however, that Riker's presence in the Bureau from 1929 to 1971 was a peacemaking one. With
                    her strong ties to the department that trained her and durable friendships with Kohlmeier, Lynch,
                    Esarey, R. C. Buley, and later with Barnhart, Riker's power in the Bureau perhaps partly
                    mollified the university's sense that their leadership had been evaded.</p>
            <p>As has been suggested by the foregoing, there were several kinds of historical editing undertaken by
                    Riker and her colleagues. The first, already mentioned, was consultation with authors about
                    potential manuscripts. The editors used their judgment about what would be valuable (and possible,
                    given available sources) to suggest the shape of proposed research. In the same vein the editors
                    evaluated completed manuscripts, often seeking the opinions of specialists before making their
                    decisions. Once manuscripts were accepted in principle, the editors often proposed revisions or
                    additions of various extensiveness to improve the clarity and/or usefulness of the work. The editors
                    performed normal copy-editing chores, correcting <list type="footnotes">

                    for the printer. Historical editors, in addition, verified the research, so far as possible, by
                    checking the footnotes for accuracy in quotation and for their validity as evidence. In these
                    situations the editors nurtured an author and his or her document.</p>
            <p>There were, of course, conflicts. Hawkins recalled that Riker's steely integrity about her
                    sense of historical truth led on rare occasions to stand-offs with authors. It was his sense that,
                    while he and Thornbrough shared Riker's standards, Riker exhibited a distinctively moral
                    passion for historical truth that reflected her essentially religious view of the world.</p>
            <p>Riker was most noted as a documentary editor. She edited or coedited some of the most admired and
                    useful documents published by the Bureau and the Society, including <hi rend="i">Laws of Indiana
                        Territory, 1809-1816</hi> (1934), <hi rend="i">Executive Proceedings of the State of Indiana,
                        1816-1836</hi> (1947), <hi rend="i">The John Tiplon Papers</hi> (3 vols., 1942), <hi rend="i">Journals of the General Assembly of Indiana Territory, 1805-1815</hi> (1950), <hi rend="i">Indiana Election Returns, 1816-1851</hi> (19601, and three volumes of the messages and papers
                    of Indiana governors (those of James Brown Ray, Noah Noble, and David Wallace). This partial list
                    represents an enormous body of scholarship. It is not too much to say that Riker was responsible for
                    publishing more scholarship on the documents of Indiana political history than anyone else. Indiana
                    University's gift to the Bureau (or hostage/princess, if you will) was the most productive
                    single researcher in the field of Indiana political history for fifty years. She was rivaled only by
                    her colleague Gayle Thornbrough in any area of Indiana history. Unlike academic historians, of
                    course, Riker and Thornbrough were paid to do historical research, full time and year round, and
                    spent thcir working lives with ready access to most of the documents and secondary sources they
                    needed.</p>
            <p>This "best job in the world" entailed identifying important kinds of documents to
                    publish; selecting and arranging documents, following scrupulous analysis of their meaning and
                    completeness; annotating the documents to clarify obscure references and identify individuals;
                    placing the documents in their context by way of introduction; copy-editing the manuscript;
                    and—in some ways most importantly—creating an analytical and accurate index to
                    make the documents easily usable by researchers.<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While Riker spent most of her career editing documents of state building, her last eight years she
                    joined with Thornbrough in editing the diary of Calvin Fletcher, one of the most impressive personal

                     <hi rend="sup">33</hi> Among Riker's earliest assignments was the creation of an
                            index, published in 1930, to the first twenty-five volumes of the IMH. An excellent
                            preparation for her career in Indiana history, the assignment not only taught Riker herself
                            what had been published, it permitted her lo create an intelligent and accurate resource

                    richest single source in Indiana history (with the possible exception of newspapers) for the period
                    it covers, but also, because of its author's intelligence, energy, and habits of
                    reflection, one of the great American diaries. Riker brought the wealth of forty-plus years of
                    knowledge to her part of this last big project for the women editors, and both used the project to
                    train Paula Corpuz, their younger colleague, who joined them as a full editor within a few years. It
                    was a splendid last "hurrah" as each woman headed into retirement.</p>
            <p>Riker's work on the Fletcher diary reflected her interest in the documents associated with
                    social history and the lives of ordinary persons, a consistent part of her passion for historical
                    truth. The same interest prompted her to support genealogy and the efforts of ordinary persons to be
                    their own historians. Riker was an influential member of the genealogy committee of the Indiana
                    Historical Society and of the Family History Section which succeeded it. She used her experience
                    with historical documents to provide authoritative transcriptions of birth, death, and marriage
                    records from a wide variety of sources in the conviction that the broader the popular interest in
                    history the more likely it was that historical documents would be preserved and in friendly sympathy
                    with genealogists as fellow seekers of the elusive past.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unlike her editorial colleagues, Riker also produced an important monograph, <hi rend="i">Indiana to
                        1816.</hi> Although she was listed as coauthor, with John D. Barnhart (1895-1967), of the first
                    volume of the multivolume history of Indiana published jointly by the Bureau and the Society
                    (1965-), it was widely known that Barnhart's manuscript, prepared during the ordeal of the
                    long illness before his death, was essentially unusable. While Riker researched and rewrote the
                    book, she was influenced by Barnhart's earlier works and benefited from his research.
                    Moreover, she had respected and liked the man; she felt it was appropriate to acknowledge him and
                    insisted that he be credited with coauthorship.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Perhaps, too, this was a
                    continuing part of the peacemaking role she played with the Indiana University History Department.

            <p>Riker was the logical choice to prepare the volume on the territorial period by virtue of her
                    documentary works on territorial laws and the legislative journals. She had also published an early
                    paper on Francis Vigo, demonstrating her acquaintance with Revolutionary War materials. She knew
                    French, and her personal interest in the period had prompted her to read widely in the secondary
                        literature.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Nevertheless, it was a daunting assignment. She was required
                    to provide an authoritative account of a geographic entity not yet meaningfully defined for most of
                    the period covered: Indiana did not yet exist, in any form, for eight of the thirteen chapters. The
                    assignment covered an enormous time period (prehistory to 1816) and three colonial
                    regimes—the French, the British, and the: American. Riker demonstrated command of a
                    significantly more extensive body of material than that required of the other authors of the
                    series' volumes. Fortunately, she had help: Shirley S. McCord, the next generation of
                    Bureau editor, trained by Riker herself, was research assistant and chief copy editor for the
                        volume.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riker produced a fine monograph, praised in scholarly journals as "straightforward and
                    authoritative," "scholarly, impressively researched, and lucidly
                    presented." It contained, said one reviewer, "interpretation and information
                    … not found in other books." Some reviewers complained that her approach was
                    "very traditional … with a strong emphasis on political, diplomatic and military
                    history" and failed to place Indiana's experience in comparative context. All
                    called attention to Riker's bibliography. Sidney Glazer of <placeName>

                    teachers' colleges, with a tiny elite teaching in women's colleges. In her study
                    of the period 1890-1940 Jacqueline Goggin has documented a regular pattern of discrimination against
                    women in faculty recruitment and hiring at universities, coeducational colleges, and men's
                    colleges similar to the discrimination noted by Peter Novick against males who were Jewish, black,
                    or (except in Catholic institutions) Roman Catholic in the same time period.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                    Indeed, Goggin shows a decline in academic opportunities for women with doctorates between 1930 and
                    1970, a decline that reflected the depression of the 1930s, the national emergency of war in the
                    1940s, and the fervid domesticity of the postwar period.</p>
            <p>So, despite the optimistic degree seeking of would-be women historians in the 1920s, for most of the
                    twentieth century they were excluded from academe and were suffered to serve only along the margins
                    of the profession, usually in settings that increasingly assumed the atmosphere of the trenches as
                    the century wore on: embattled public high schools and defensive teachers' colleges and
                    schools of education. In the context of the last third of the twentieth century, with an expanded
                    national commitment to the democratization of American culture and the general agreement that all
                    should aspire to the privileges earlier accorded only to white males, the denial of the privileges
                    of the academy to all women and to male members of traditionally despised groups seems profoundly
                    unjust. But this late-twentieth century categorization of the fate of women such as Dorothy
                    Riker—as victims of an entrenched prejudice against women—seems unfaithful to
                    Riker's own sense of the significance of her life.</p>
            <p>To assess her life by a careerist standard—by how much power, prestige, money she achieved
                    in comparison to (by definition "privileged") male historians—is to
                    distort its meaning for her and her contemporaries. Riker took pride in what she did; she believed
                    that her editorial work was as significant a contribution to the profession as university teaching,
                    and she knew that she did it outstandingly well. Moreover, she subscribed to an ethic of service;

                    relentless and cheerful do-gooder (in a homey, personal, neighborly way—she was always
                    running errands for "the old people," as she called them when she herself was
                    eighty) as well as a creative and fertile researcher; both doing good and doing history were her
                    passions.</p>
            <p>Riker rejected much of what twentieth-century American culture told her was important in favor of a
                    life of scholarship cloistered in the Indiana State Library, dividing her love between the documents
                    of the past and the people she found around her. What looked like the margins of the historical
                    profession from some perspectives looked like a splendid life's mission to Riker. For her,
                    history was a calling, and her joy was that <hi rend="i">she</hi> was chosen.</p>
            <p>When chosen, she was not found wanting. Expanded opportunities for professional training in history
                    for women in the early twentieth century opened doors for Riker and her fellow women editors at the

            <p>In July, 1874, legendary Indian fighter Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer led his Seventh <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Cavalry Regiment on a mission into the Black Hills of the Dakotas, ostensibly to find a
                    site for a new military post. A second assignment of this expedition, however, was to confirm or
                    deny long existing rumors, never formally investigated, of rich gold deposits in the region. Within
                    a few weeks the release of Custer's reports on his findings supported the belief that gold
                    indeed existed in the Black Hills, and a nation caught in an economic depression was swept with
                    gold-hunting hysteria.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for would-be white adventurers, federal officials recognized the claims of Lakotas,
                    Yanktons, Yanktonais, and a number of neighboring tribes to some 60,000,000 acres in the Black Hills
                    region, including all of modern South Dakota west of the <geogName>Missouri River</geogName>, by the
                    terms of the Fort Laramie Treaty negotiated in 1868 and ratified the following year. Legally, the
                    military was bound by the provisions of the treaty to keep all whites out of this "Great
                    Sioux Reservation." The stage was thus set for confrontation between American soldiers and
                    civilians as the army faced the overwhelming task of preventing large numbers of prospectors, men
                    determined to take their chances by challenging the military, from invading the Black Hills.</p>
            <p>One of those who ventured into the Hills during 1875 and 1876 was Hoosier Samuel Zent. In early 1875
                    Zent joined the Gordon Expedition, a group that left <placeName>

                    </placeName> troops on the way, and was roughly handled by the soldiers. Turned back but undaunted,
                    Zent journeyed to the Dakota Territory in 1876 and actually did pan for gold, only to give up a few
                    months later when he failed to find substantial deposits.</p>

                    subsequent letters from various points during his second trip west, Zent related the difficulties
                    experienced by green miners and detailed the rapidly changing environment of the Dakota Territory in
                    the mid-1870s. He left a rare contemporary record of the experiences of a tenderfoot Hoosier
                    correspondent seeking his fortune in an alien land.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In early 1875 various army generals and their superiors in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C., were determined to honor the Indian treaty and prevent prospectors from entering
                    the Black Hills. The military made an effort to dissuade miners by issuing less than glowing reports
                    on the existence of gold in the region. General Philip H. Sheridan, for instance, reported that
                    Custer's tests for gold deposits were "not sufficient to establish their existence
                    in large quantities." Unfortunately, in many cases this tactic failed. In addition, Custer
                    himself did not help the army's efforts. At first he wrote much the same as Sheridan,
                    noting that until further tests were done "no opinion should be formed" regarding
                    the richness of the gold.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Later, he trumpeted that the gold reports
                    "are not exaggerated in the least; the prospects are even better than
                        represented."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Despite such contradictory information many
                    newspapers and the public firmly believed the Black Hills area was a "New
                    Eldorado."</p>
            <p>Not every newspaper, however, was convinced that the rewards were worth the risks. One northeastern
                    Indiana paper, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ligonier</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">National Banner</hi>, jokingly called the Black Hills the area "where gold
                    grows on bushes." The editor went on to warn readers that the region must be covered with
                    snow almost half the year, that the nearest supplies were hundreds of miles away, and that miners
                    would have to resist the attacks of hundreds, even thousands, of Sioux warriors. Furthermore, the
                    area that contained gold rocks was small, benefiting few miners, and after exhausting the gold in
                    streams, miners would have to abandon the endeavor or find machinery, which was an impossibility.
                    All these factors combined <list type="footnotes">

            <p>With efforts to minimize the presence of gold in large quantities unsuccessful in many instances, the
                    military turned to a threat of force, clearly stating its intention to block physically the attempts
                    of whites to enter the Sioux region. The commanding general of the army, William Tecumseh Sherman,
                    told a reporter in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on March 11, 1875, that all miners would be kept out and that those who happened to
                    slip through would be driven out. These instructions to his troops would be "carried out by
                    force of arms if necessary," for, he said, the "integrity of the treaty with the
                    Sioux will be maintained at all hazards."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Sherman further explained to
                    the reporter that the miners had no more right to enter Sioux lands than to "make a descent
                    upon the property of you or me, and carry off what they find of value." He threatened that
                    the miners, once driven off, would forfeit all their equipment.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    Walker succeeded in capturing the party "&amp; sent them under a strong guard

                    gold-hunting captives had "greatly weakened his force. Walker's scouts told him

                                    </placeName> I supposed that long ere this I should be delving in the gold mines
                                    among the Black Hills, but as yet I have not even been permitted to view the
                                    promised land. Our trip thus far has been a long and tedious one, full of fun and
                                    adventure, often wishing that you could be with us. Our course has been rather
                                    deviating in order to avoid the military, but about two weeks since we learned by
                                    capturing a soldier scout that we were being closely watched; but that the military
                                    did not intend to interfere with us until we should cross over into Dakota
                                    Territory. Consequently we felt entirely secure from military interference as we
                                    moved up on the south side of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                                    </placeName>, enjoying the beautiful scenery that lies along this river, surpassing
                                    anything I had ever before seen. Our feeling of security was, however, of short
                                    duration. On last Wednesday morning, just as we were getting ready to move, a body
                                    of mounted soldiers commanded by Major Walker, from Fort Randall, pounced upon us
                                    and before we knew what they were about had placed a line of guards around our camp.
                                    Walker then informed us that we would be taken to Fort Randall, distant about 180
                                    miles. Against this outrage we protested, but to no avail. Each member of our party
                                    appeared to be trying to argue his own case and considerable confusion prevailed.
                                    Some one spoke of resisting the outrage, when Major Walker turned to one of his
                                    subordinates and in a pompous manner ordered him to get his men ready for action.
                                    Our "Dutch was up," but rather than fight the guardians of our
                                    liberties—God save the mark!—we concluded that it was best to
                                    submit. We were formed into line and numbered, then we were inrenformed [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] that we would have to surrender our arms. Against this we
                                    again protested. But to no purpose. Several of the boys finally gave up their arms.
                                    For my part, I would not so much as give up a cartridge. After Major Walker had got
                                    all the arms he could from the boys we were started back for Fort Randall. As yet
                                    our captors had failed to learn who was John Gordon, although no attempt at
                                    concealment was made on his part, and so anxious were they to get hold of him that
                                    they offered $50 to any one who would point out John Gordon. But the love
                                    the boys <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-091-3-032"/> entertain for their leader was too
                                    strong and the offer was not accepted. During the following night Gordon, with three
                                    faithful followers, succeeded in passing through the soldiers’ pickets.
                                    The next day was spent in marching over the same road where we had marched only a
                                    few days before; then full of life and hope, now as woe-begone and chop-fallen a set
                                    of fellows as it has ever been my lot to be associated with. During the succeeding
                                    night I resolved to cut loose and join Gordon, but in attempting to do so I brought
                                    up against a picket post and was sent back to camp in anything but a pleasant mood I
                                    assure you.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Friday morning it was found that the bars on the
                                    wagon wheels had been stolen during the previous night, consequently we could not
                                        move.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This gave the boys an opportunity to discuss the
                                    legality of troops to arrest parties in <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                                    </placeName> going to the Black Hills in Dakota. So in the afternoon we informed the
                                    Major that we would go no farther, and that if he had any authority for taking us he
                                    could have an opportunity of exercising it. This Walker did not wish to do, and
                                    finally gave his consent to our departure, provided we would not invade the Hills at
                                    present, or until after the Indian title thereto shall have expired. But as I formed
                                    no part or party in this compromise, I intend to exercise my own pleasure about
                                    staying out of the Hills.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No doubt you will hear of the capture of Gordon's party, as Major Walker
                                    sent a carrier to Fort Randall as soon as he had us arrested. There were a few
                                    independent wagons moving with Gordon's party who were nearly out of
                                    provisions. These concluded to go with Walker. Gordon's party is stronger
                                    to-day than ever before, notwithstanding the fact that about forty of the boys are
                                    without arms, Major Walker refusing to give them up. When
                                    "respectfully" requested to return our arms, Walker said those
                                    guns were eighty miles from us, on the way to Fort Randall. The boys feel this
                                    indignity more than all the rest, as these arms were their own private property and
                                    invaluable as a means of defense in this Indian country. The boys intend to appeal
                                    to the Governor of <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                                    </placeName> for redress in this matter, for it is certain that if Major Walker had
                                    no right to take us by force to Fort Randall, he had no right to take our arms.</p>
                        <p>On Friday afternoon we took our leave of Major Walker and again started westward,
                                    traveling at the rate of about thirty miles <list type="footnotes">

                    Walker sent his report to Camp Sheridan and asked for cooperation and communications. According to

            <p>Walker's report, carried by "John," a Yankton Sioux scout in the service
                    of the government, reached the hand of Captain Anson Mills at Camp Sheridan, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName>, on the morning of May 17.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Mills noted that Walker was
                    "greatly embarrassed by a weak force and a determination on the part of the miners to
                    harass him in every way and perhaps resist even to the shedding of blood which they might readily do
                    with success" because of Walker's inferior numbers (30 versus 150). Accordingly,
                    Mills left early the next morning with a mixed force of cavalry and infantry numbering over 60 men,
                    along with a Gatling gun, to assist Walker. Their march was not easy—along the way the
                    troops experienced "a remarkable and severe rain and hail storm" from a small
                    cloud which seemed to hover over the men while "the sun was shining in almost every
                    direction …." To make matters worse, in the early part of the storm lightning
                    bolts struck the earth near the soldiers, "throwing the dirt and dust to great heights,
                    resembling artillery scenes during the [Civil] War …." Mills noted this
                    "remarkable phenomenon," something he had never before witnessed or heard of, in
                    his report. After making slow progress in the soft ground, Mills camped for the night. The following
                    day the detachment pushed rapidly ahead; and after a halt was called to establish camp, Mills sent a
                    party of two men forward to try to find Walker and propose to him that the miners be handled
                    "without gloves" by executing General Order Number 2. One of Mills's
                    messengers, dressed in civilian clothes, stole into camp and found the captain without raising the
                    suspicions of the miners. The soldier returned early the next morning with Walker's
                    favorable reply.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Mills quickly prepared for action. He put his men in the saddle and led them off, taking the Gatling
                    gun but leaving behind his ambulances and wagons. At 5:45 a.m., the troop charged into the Gordon
                    camp, taking care to "prevent the possibility of escape of the leaders, the secreting of
                    the property, annoyance by stampede and possible show of resistance by intrenchment
                    …." Mills recorded that Gordon's men were as surprised "as

                        <p>Feeling perfectly secure, little did we dream of the fearful storm that was gathering
                                    in the heart of this dastardly coward and villain, Walker, and that would so soon
                                    sweep down upon us like a besom of destruction. This lying sneak, as I afterwards
                                    learned, sent an Indian runner to Fort Laramie for reinforcements, stating that we
                                    were three hundred strong; that we had two Gatlin [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] guns; were
                                    fortifying ourselves and defying the Government.</p>
                        <p>It was Friday morning, May 21st. The sun had just made his appearance above the
                                    horizon. Not more than half the boys were up, when Walker with his command,
                                    supported by a cavalry force and a Gatlin gun from Ft. Laramie, made a dash upon our
                                    camp, and in less time than I can write it threw a guard around us. Walker, with a
                                    body of soldiers, then passed through our quarters and ordered us into line,
                                    remarking that he was "now running this thing," and to intimidate
                                    us the more, pointed to the Gatlin gun, which had been loaded and placed in a
                                    commanding position near our camp. After some little delay, the boys quietly marched
                                    out about twenty rods from our quarters to a place indicated by our captors.</p>
                        <p>It was at this stage of the game that I thought to take refuge behind my rights as a

                                    boot leather from the pedal extremity of an overgrown orderly sergeant, we concluded
                                    the refuge a little too thin and quietly succumbed. A heavy guard was placed around
                                    us, and for six long hours we were compelled to stand and witness the wanton</p>

                        <p>At first these vandals, with their officers at their head, proceeded to help
                                    themselves to our breakfast, which had been left <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-091-3-037"/> untouched by us. Having glutted their greed, ransacked our quarters, broken open
                                    valises and stolen every valuable article of clothing that they could find, the
                                    general destruction of property was commenced. A fire was built in a ravine close
                                    by, into which wagon after wagon, with their contents, were rolled. After they had
                                    destroyed our provisions and amunition [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], they broke and
                                    burned our rifles and revolvers. Many of the rifles were of the latest improved

                        <p>During all this time scarcely a murmur was heard among the boys, as they stood with
                                    clinched fists and knitted brows watching the destruction of their property by this

                                    a distance of about two hundred and fifty miles. When we arrived at the Fort (June
                                    1st) Walker wished to turn us over to the commander of the post, but that officer
                                    positively refused to have anything to do with us, "for," said he,
                                    "this arrest has been made without my sanction."</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 3d inst. we were placed across the <geogName>Missouri

                        <p>Many of the members of this unfortunate expedition were of the poorer class, who,
                                    with the hope of bettering their condition, had invested their last dollar in
                                    procuring the necessary outfit. Several of these started out on foot for Yankton,
                                    distant about eighty miles. Six of us constructed a thing—scarcely

            <p>Faced with the impossibility of barring the miners, the government attempted a legal settlement with
                    the Indians regarding the Black Hills. A frustrated government commission met with the Sioux in an
                    attempt to buy the region, but by late September, 1875, the conference ended as the Indians could
                    not agree on whether to sell or retain their sacred ground. Consequently, in a White House meeting
                    of high military and civilian leaders in November, it was agreed that the army would no longer
                    enforce General Order No. 2 and that the Black Hills would be seized. Bands of roaming,
                    non-reservation Sioux, not tied to government agencies and rations, had frustrated the purchasing
                    negotiations and were supposedly raiding outside the Great Sioux Reservation. These Indians would be
                    forced onto the reservation, an action that would allow for the uninhibited settlement of the Black
                    Hills by whites and bring the troublesome Sioux under tighter government control. If the increased
                    ties to the federal government failed to influence the Sioux to sell the region, the army would
                    launch a campaign against them and so have an excuse for taking the Black Hills.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> The Indians had until January 31, 1876, to report to their agencies. Many of them ignored

            <p>Undeterred by the growing potential for armed conflict in the regon in 1876, Zent determined to try
                    again for the Black Hills. In early March his hometown newspaper wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We regret to learn that our esteemed and worthy townsman, Col. S. M. Zent, has determined to
                            again seek his fortune in the Black Hills. The favorable reports from that region have
                            induced the gallant Colonel to try his luck for a second time. We can only express the hope
                            that his anticipations may be realized to a more satisfactory extent than heretofore, and
                            that he may return to our midst with ample supplies of the precious metal. He will leave

            <p>Zent was certainly not alone in wanting to travel to the Black Hills in the spring of
                    America's centennial year. In the words of one writer, "Representatives of every
                    trade and profession under the sun came rushing along, figuratively, tumbling over each other in

                    contradicting many of the earlier unfavorable comments made by the National Banner regarding the

                            are also very rich. I think this is a good country for a poor man. But few mines have been
                            developed as yet; nearly all of them, however, are known to be very rich. There is not much

                                    happy as a "big sunflower." We left Cheyenne March 16th, and after

                                    </placeName>. Our trip here was a very unpleasant one on account of the cold and
                                    disagreeable weather and the frequent snow storms that we encountered while crossing
                                    the Laramie plains. We frequently had to shovel our way through snow drifts several
                                    feet deep. We also learned by sad experience that this route, instead of being only
                                    200 miles, is all of 300, and a very rough one at that. The country is principally a
                                    barren waste, except along the water courses. Between Cheyenne and Fort Laramie

                                            1876, a group of 125 men were organized as Minute Men to drive off Indians
                                            who appeared near the city, while a Provisional Black Hills Superior Court
                                            was established to deal with all judicial matters until regular courts were
                                            opened. In the summer of 1876 the first public school in the Black Hills was

                                    all kinds is represented here. The city is teeming with miners from all parts of the
                                    country, and are patiently waiting for the opening up of spring. March was the
                                    severest month of the winter here. At present the weather is moderating rapidly.</p>
                        <p>Nothing has been done here this spring in the way of mining. I have been shown
                                    several fine specimens of gold that were taken out last fall. At present I cannot
                                    advise anyone to come here. I think a few months later will be better. At this time
                                    all is jam and confusion. Many who came here with rather exalted ideas as to the
                                    mineral wealth of the Hills, and failing to find gold nuggets lying around waiting
                                    to be picked up, are becoming disgusted and returning home.</p>

                                    lumber is selling at $30 per thousand. Flour sells at $11 per

                        <settlement type="city">Custer City</settlement>
                    </placeName> toward the town of Deadwood, Dakota Territory. He moved into the area of the first
                    Black Hills gold discoveries, a region that stretched from the first mining district established in
                    May, 1875, on French Creek (near Custer) on the south to Whitewood Creek (near Deadwood) on the
                    north, a distance of fifty miles which contained thirty-eight <geogName>gulches</geogName> and
                        <geogName>creek valleys</geogName>. Some gold deposits in this area were considerable, but with
                    the large number of miners present, the profits were small. As historian William s. Greever has
                    written, "From no claim anywhere in the Black Hills did a prospector make a large
                    fortune." Zent's success, like that of many others, was very limited.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Zent eventually landed in colorful Deadwood, a surprisingly well developed area in 1876 and the
                    center of Black Hills gold mining. The initial gold find was made in Deadwood in August, 1875, and
                    in the early spring of 1876 the rush there began. Claims were <list type="footnotes">

                    by the end of January. Gradually, hundreds of disappointed miners either extended claims into
                    neighboring gulches, returned to other Black Hills areas, or abandoned the region altogether.
                    Although the site of the town of Deadwood was laid out in April of 1876, by autumn of the same year
                    the population had soared to seven thousand. By the last part of September the town had a newspaper,
                    bakeries, billiard establishments, dance halls, gambling houses, and practically every other
                    conceivable business.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> One author wrote that in Deadwood "could be

                                    miles to the north-west of us, we struck tent and pulled out for White Wood Creek.
                                    On reaching here, we were utterly surprised at finding White Wood Gulch teeming with
                                    busy miners, and the banks of the creek lined with cabins and tents, for miles. The
                                    principal tributary to the White Wood is Dead Wood. This gulch, if possible,
                                    presents a more lively appearance than White Wood. Some of the richest mines yet
                                    discovered in the Black Hills, or anywhere else, since the discovery of the famous

                                    </placeName>, have been found on White Wood and its tributaries.</p>
                        <p>Miners from all parts of the Hills are flocking to this place. These discoveries have
                                    given a new impetus to the mining interests of the Black Hills, and many who were on
                                    the point of returning home have taken new courage. Cities are springing up like
                                    magic in this new eldorado. Crook City, at the mouth of White Wood, Elizabeth City,
                                    twelve miles up White Wood, Dead Wood City, at the mouth of Dead Wood Creek and half
                                    a mile above Elizabeth (the two are now blended in one). Gayville (the only town in
                                    the Hills which makes no pretensions toward being a "city"), is
                                    quite a thriving place, two miles above Dead Wood City. Centennial City, one mile
                                    above Crook, is yet an embryo, but big things are anticipated by its projectors.</p>

                        <p>The mining ground on White Wood and its tributaries has all been taken up, and the
                                    only chance now is to buy a claim. Some idea may be formed of the richness of these
                                    mines when I tell you that over two thousand dollars have been taken out of one
                                    claim in a day, worked by eight miners. How is this for $14 a day for
                                    hands? Smith says: "Let the man in the brick saloon by the <placeName>

                                    $6 per day, boarding not included. At present I would not advise any one
                                    to come to the Hills, unless they have a few spare hundred dollars or wish to work
                                    in the mines, and which, I can assure my readers, is not pleasant by any means.</p>
                        <p>The Indians have committed several depredations, mostly in the southern part of the
                                    Hills and on the Cheyenne and Yankton routes. We anticipate no trouble from them
                                    here. Some scouts have been employed, however, to keep a sharp look-out, in case
                                    they should see fit to make an attack.</p>
                        <p>Before closing, I will endeavor to give your readers a brief description of the Black
                                    Hills, as far as my observation extends: The Black Hills are a clear cut, well
                                    defined mountain mass, thrown up in the midst of an almost boundless plain. Their
                                    flank, <pb n="284" id="VAA4025-091-3-046"/> for the most part is very abrupt,
                                    presenting an almost perfect wall. On entering them, the mind is filled with wonder
                                    and amazement, as it contemplates these might upheavals, especially in the vicinity
                                    of Harney's Peak. Here strata of rock, hundreds of feet in thickness, have
                                    been thrown up, until they stand almost vertical. Is this the result of one mighty
                                    instantaneous upheaval, or is it the gradual work of ages? But what is more pleasing
                                    to the eye than all else pertaining to the Hills, especially after having spent
                                    several days upon the open plains, are the beautiful pine forests that greet you on
                                    all sides. These forests of pine, with their peculiar, dark green foliage, cover the
                                    major portion of the hills.</p>
                        <p>Game, such as deer and elk, are quite plentiful, and Smith, with his unerring
                                    "Betsey," succeeds in keeping our larder well supplied with
                                    venison. Pheasants, too, are numerous, and afford up many a delicious repast. Fish,
                                    I am sorry to say, are scarce. The largest I have yet found were a species of small
                                    suckers, and I think I may safely say that there is not a man in the Black Hills
                                    that has an eye more to fishing than I have.</p>
                        <p>Our mails are very uncertain, those blasted "red skins" having
                                    taken it in several times.</p>

            <p>Ironically, at the same time that Zent was struggling in the gold fields, his hometown newspaper was
                    still printing doubtful columns regarding the gold rush. Explaining that it was difficult to form
                    any accurate opinion on gold in the Black Hills, the <hi rend="i">National Banner</hi>, in its "<placeName>

                    could not be picked up by the shovelful there, the precious substance could be found in paying
                    quantities in certain parts of the region. Based on this evidence, however, "hundreds and
                    perhaps thousands" had gone there supposing they would be able to make "their
                    ‘etarnal fortins’ in a few weeks, and have been grievously
                    disappointed," the paper reported. Such fortune seekers had also been forced to run a
                    gauntlet of large bands of hostile Sioux seeking scalps, who had already killed hundreds of miners,
                    and hundreds more would be killed trying to leave the area "which they once imagined was an

            <p>Although Colonel Zent and countless others failed to find their fortune in the Black Hills. some
                    eventually did. In 1877 it was estimated that the gold mined from quartz in the region amounted to
                    $1.5 million while that from placers (washing or dredging sand or gravel containing gold)
                    totaled $1 million. The personal fortune lost by the Indian population with the seizure
                    of their sacred Black Hills is incalculable. The issue of the Black Hills was finally settled to
                    white satisfaction in September and October, 1876. A treaty <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Even after his return from the failed Black Hills expedition, Zent's determination to stay
                    in a "land of civilization" did not last. He had left <placeName>

                    </placeName> by 1884. In 1892 he resigned his office as township trustee and sought relief for
                    troubling rheumatism in a more southern climate, namely the Indian Territory (present day <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName>). Unable to find a land claim, Zent started a tinsmith business in the town of Okarche,

                    </placeName>. Still in need of relief from his ailment, in November, 1893, Zent returned to the
                    territory, settling in the town of Blackwell in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kay County</region>

                    find fault with the cooking." Zent's second stay in the Indian Territory was
                    short-lived as well. Soon he decided that he liked <placeName>

            <p>On November 16, 1864, William Allen Clark writes to his parents in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clinton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, from his Civil War encampment in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, "I could give you a sircumstance of political strategy, but I only Carey a
                    gun, so I had better keep mum." Penned after <geogName>Stones River</geogName>,
                    Hoover's Gap, Chickamauga, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Gap, and countless other battles, his words reflect his
                    exhaustion, his penchant for sarcasm, and his devotion to duty. Indeed, these emotions are themes in
                    almost all his letters home from July, 1863, through February, 1864. To David C. and Mary
                    Clark—farmers from north central Indiana, steadfast Missionary Baptists, equally
                    steadfast Democrats—their son complains, typically, about army life, makes homesick pleas
                    for news from the Hoosier state, subtly hints of his infatuation with Alma <placeName>
                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                    </placeName>, a cousin, and concludes almost every letter with requests for paper and stamps. Most
                    importantly, as the summer of 1864 approaches, he predicts all too accurately what he will face as
                    he marches into <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> with General William T. Sherman. His letters to his family are less frequent, but more
                    piquant.</p>
            <p>Although much of what Clark reports is rumor, he more frequently comments about the war in his
                    letters written from midsummer, 1863, through February, 1864. Whether in a military or political
                    context, his statements prove once again that he is an Indiana Democrat. Clark opposes the war, but
                    his opposition to a divided Union is stronger. He is anti-abolitionist, antiblack. He grumbles about
                    Governor Oliver P. Morton's policies as well as President Lincoln's, rejoicing
                    when election results celebrate "a big man's littleness." His humor
                    remains subtle. In midsummer, 1863, both Robert E. Lee and George G. Meade are acting "in
                    the Defensive!" he reports. There is fighting at <placeName>

                    months," he writes his parents.</p>
            <p>Clark enlisted in the Union Army on August 8, 1862. He spends the anniversary of his first year in
                    service in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and admits that he does not know why he joined the army. Later, in September, after the

                        <settlement type="city">Chickamauga</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he writes tiredly: "I will quit making peace Prophecies. All the Bright
                    prospects have Vanished." The battlefield pictures of <geogName>Stones River</geogName> and
                    Chickamauga have wounded his memory, coloring the beauty of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> with blood and overlaying it with images of the body of his regimental chaplain,
                    decapitated at Hoover's Gap. Not even Christians, the nineteen-year-old Clark realizes, are
                    protected from war's brutality, and he admonishes himself for volunteering for war because
                    he thought it would be glorious. An ineffective army regime, "Despotic" officers,
                    and ever-present danger make up reality.</p>
            <p>With at least part of the 72nd Indiana encamped in Huntsville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, for a while, Clark relaxes. He enjoys church and the company of the local Baptist
                    minister, the Reverend David Adams, a "Peace man" who "is opposed to the
                    war on both sides." The Adamses invite Clark into their home, and readers can assume that
                    it is not only the minister's hospitality but also the minister's daughter,
                    Maggie, that make Clark feel light-hearted. The letters from Huntsville are particularly well
                    written, the sentences long, descriptive, and reflective. Clark sees <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clinton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the eyes and faces of the Huntsville residents. His days in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> are almost like being home, he says, although he still misses his family and the
                    Rossville farm.</p>
            <p>Indeed, loneliness and a sense of isolation pervade all of Clark's correspondence. With
                    little information except that allowed by army commanders, he begs for news in almost every letter:
                    news about friends at home and in the army; news of his younger brother George's carefree
                    escapades in school and on the farm; news concerning the draft, elections, and politics in Indiana;
                    news as to political maneuverings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, D.C.; even news about what he himself has done and might be doing on the battlefields
                    in the South. "Nothing is as acceptable as a letter from home."</p>
            <p>On February 28, 1864, Clark writes perhaps the most moving of all his Civil War letters. Seated
                    "with my back to you," he describes to his parents the activities that he knows
                    are underway in their <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clinton County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, home on a rainy Sunday morning. It is raining in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
               </placeName> County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, too, "not showers," he says, "but big drops that fall
                    straight to the ground." Clark uses this quiet time to detail all the minutia of camp life.
                    In a sense, his letter is representative of the thousands sent home during the war. He writes of the
                    weather, contrabands, camp recreational activities, smallpox, his quarters, which include
                    "a fancy cupboard, and writing desk," his clothing, the sutlers, pictures for
                    those at <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-091-3-052"/> home, war news, religion. He comments on news from
                    home and concludes, as always, "I have no stamps, and I would like to have a few if you
                    will be kind enough to send them."</p>
            <p>Throughout his first year and a half as a Union soldier, Clark continues to count his blessings; he
                    also remains politically fixed in his beliefs. He opposes abolitionists, hates blacks, challenges
                    the emancipation of slaves, dislikes what he terms censorship by the army commanders, distrusts the
                    growing power of state and federal governments. He believes in compromise, and he wants to go home.
                    Most importantly, however, he opposes secession. His refusal to see the Union severed takes him
                    deeper into the South in 1864 and 1865 as he follows Sherman across <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>

                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Then, eventually, he and the 72nd make their way back across <placeName>

                              <hi rend="sup">2</hi> In July, 1863, Clark was still a private in Company K of
                                        the 72nd Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In April of that year Richard H.
                                        McIntire had replaced Hiram B. Collins as captain of Company K, Colonel Abram O.
                                        Miller was regimental commander. The 72nd belonged to Colonel John T.
                                        Wilder's famed "Lightning Brigade" of mounted
                                        infantry, i.e., the First Brigade, which was assigned to the 4th Division, under
                                        the command of General Joseph J. Reynolds; XIV Corps, commanded by General

                                        hiatus following the Tullahoma campaign, one purpose of which had been to

                                        although he discussed privately, with the president and others, various peace
                                        and reconstruction plans, he did not favor the reinstitution of slavery, amnesty

                        <salute>Dear Parents,</salute>
                        <p>I take my pen to write you a few lines to let you know how I am getting along. It is
                                    4 o'clock P.M., and the mercury stands at 87° with some prospect
                                    of rain. There is no war news worth writing. There appears to be an ominous Calm in
                                    the Military atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>We are in a pretty country. It is well watered, but the crops are light in
                                    consequence of the heavy rains of the forepart of last month. We are on half
                                    rations. True we have plenty of hard tack, but man cant live by Bread alone, and we
                                    have had nothing else since yesterday morning. But we don't do much,
                                    consequently dont eat much. I guess we will get full Rations tonight as there was a
                                    train of supplies come in for Reynold's Div. to day.</p>
                        <p>We are to have inspection in about an hour to inspect Arms, accoutrements, clothing,
                                    and horse Equipment. I have been busy to day cleaning my gun and clothes in order to
                                    make a respectable appearance.</p>
                        <p>I would have wrote this morning, but thought I would wait till the mail come. It has
                                    arrived now, but nothing for me. I have received no letters from anyone for sometime
                                    except one from you, which contained the ground work of five letters complete. The
                                    envelops and stamps are of the most importance. I succeeded in getting some paper
                                    off the Sutler by giving three prices for it.</p>
                        <p>Cosmas Rhodes of the 10th Regiment was here yesterday. There is some talk of their
                                    Regiment coming into Wilder's Division. The 4th Cavalry is camped about two
                                    miles from here, but I cant get to them on account of provost Guards. I am going to
                                    get a pass to visit them tomorrow, provided we dont leave.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                        <p>One year ago today I enlisted what for I couldent tell. I did it without reflecting
                                    what the life of a Volunteer was. I dident appreciate the comforts and Blessings of
                                    home. In fact I done it just to be doing, and as luck would have it, I was entrapped
                                    so securely that Begging off would have been silly. The first six months I made a
                                    dunce of myself by fretting about spilt milk. I then came to the conclusion to make
                                    the best of a bad bargain. Since then I have had good health and have been
                                    contented. The war has been prolonged much longer than I then thought it would be.
                                    The clouds of' war are now brokend, but there is a dark cloud still hanging
                                    in the horizon. No one can tell when it will be compromised, but my time is one
                                    third out, and I have escaped unhurt so far unless my morals are injured. Of that it
                                    is not for me to judge of myself.</p>
                        <p>It is raining today. We have drawn ten days' Rations and are ordered to be
                                    ready to march at a moment's warning. Our destination is in the future to
                                    be proclaimed. I hope we will have better weather than we did after leaving
                                    Murfreesboro. The Officers think we will start in the morning at six.</p>

                                        volunteers to repel Morgan's invasion of Indiana in July, 1863,
                                        thirteen regiments—the 102nd through the 114th—of Minute
                                        Men were mustered into the state's service, and thousands more men
                                        awaited official organization. Although they had volunteered for thirty
                                        days' service, most were mustered out within a week. In all probability
                                        Amos Miller was one of these volunteers. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, I, Appendix,

                                    expected a fight there, he advised us to put all our valuables in the wagon. So if
                                    the knapsack is lost, I will lose miniatures, clothing, postage Stamps, etc.</p>

                                    doing. I received a letter from you last night dated the 8th inst. This is the first
                                    that I have wrote for some time, as we have had no chance to send any mail. We
                                    crossed the <geogName>[Tennessee] River</geogName> on the 9th and commenced persuing
                                    the Enemy. We went to Ringgold in this state and had a light Skirmish, two wounded.
                                    We went on to Tunnel Hill and had a Skirmish, no harm done to us. Rebel loss, 10
                                    killed. We went back to Ringgold and started out on the <placeName>

                                    Guerillas, 3000 strong. We repulsed them in about an hour. Our loss was 8 killed and
                                    13 wounded, all belonging to the 72nd. The Captain of Co. II [Co. I] was killed. His
                                    name was McMertrie. Our Company was on the right of the Skirmish line. The fighting
                                    on the left was in a field, and we was in the woods. We got behind trees so as to
                                    protect us from their Sharp Shooters. <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>I will pen you a few lines to let you know that mid all the loss of life and limb
                                    that has been suffered here within ten days, I am still spared. It is horrible to
                                    think of the Revolting Scenes of the Battlefield after moving a distance of 180
                                    miles, almost without opposition, the Enemy apparently flying from us in dismay,
                                    when we was buoyed up by the prospect of a Speedy close to hostilities. Then it was
                                    that Bragg hurled an almost irresistible tide of armed men upon us, bearing us down
                                    before them, but not without obstinate Resistance. Rosancrans's Chief

                                    in our old position. We was in the Battle the first three days, Friday, Sat., and
                                    Sunday, but our losses were small. We had 4 killed and 17 wounded in our Re. Our
                                    Captain was wounded and is supposed to be in the hands of the Enemy. He is the only
                                    one injured in Comp. K. It was awful to see the various wonds that were inflicted.
                                    Some of the Regiments were almost anihilated. The 86th is said to be all killed,
                                    wounded, and taken. The Rebels have possession of the field, and it is not likely
                                    that the dead will ever be all buried. I might tell you many <list type="footnotes">

                                            not in Company K. According to the Indiana adjutant general, one officer and

                        battle. McGee also confirms that Captain Richard H. McIntire of Company K was wounded in the
                        thigh and sent to one of the hospitals in the area and that some of the hospitals were later
                        captured by the Confederates. Although no corroborating information has been located, it can be
                        assumed from subsequent Clark correspondence that McIntire was indeed captured, then paroled or
                        exchanged. The 86th was apparently not as decimated as Clark had heard. Terrell, <hi rend="i">Report of the Indiana Adjutant General</hi>, II, 673, III, 76-78; McGee, <hi rend="i">History of the 72d</hi>, 169-72.</item>

                                    with Wheeler's Rear Guard three days. Our loss was 1 wounded. One in

                                    arrived here on the night of the 6th. The Brigade started on the next day, but as my
                                    horse had played out, I was left here as a dismounted man. There is 24 here out of

                                    how to read writing. The last letter I received from you was dated Sept. 13th. (I

                                        wagons and animals, captured and sacked a number of small towns, and harassed

                              <hi rend="sup">28</hi> Clark obviously considered Chickamauga a Union defeat,
                                        and he had evidently heard that Meade in <placeName>

                                        October 15. By October 18, however, Meade had made a stand, and Lee withdrew.
                                        Throughout most of November the Union army followed the southern forces back

                                        Meade's forces stalled. Neither side could gain an advantage in the
                                        eastern theater, and the armies went into winter quarters in December.
                                        McPherson, <hi rend="i">Atlas of the Civil War</hi>, 138-39. In considerable

                                        Russian-American relations were decidedly cordial during the Civil War. During

                                    of all who are rebels to his kingdom, and while you strive with all your power to
                                    overtake and punish your enemies (which is all right), strive equally as hard to
                                    escape the wiles and strategpes of the enemy of souls. And the only way to do that
                                    is to serve and trust in the Lord and in his care. I commend you hoping you will
                                    ever remember you Mother's and Father's advise to abstain from all
                                    evil as much as in you lies. Read your testament. Obey its instructions. Obey your
                                    officers so that if you live to come home, you can come with honor.</p>

                                    bls. per day. Cider worth $2, per bl. apples .30. Our orchard was full

                        <p>We have no news of much importance to write. I will send you some scraps of news in

                                    wagons with corn, wheat, potatoes, and hogs from the plantation of a Mr. Flem-ming.

                                        1st Lieutenant James W. Davis and 2nd Lieutenant Carey M. Layne as resigning in
                                        January, 1864. It is probable that their resignations were tendered earlier and
                                        that official action was not taken until several months later. George W.
                                        Brown's commission as 1st lieutenant is dated January, 1864; his date
                                        of muster as 1st lieutenant was April, 1864. Such delays caused problems with
                                        pay and other matters as Clark notes later. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, II, 671-72. <placeName>

                                    still in good health. I rec. 7 letters by this morning's mail, being the
                                    first since I left Huntsville, one from George W. Clark of the 20th of Dec. It
                                    pleased me to know that he been so dilligent in his studies. I am in hopes that he
                                    will continue a good Boy, and become a good man. I received a letter from I. N.

                                    It is chatted that when they come we will be furloughed home, but I fear it is a

                        <p>I once more attempt to address you on health, and general tenor of a
                                    soldier's letter. I have just received yours of the 21st &amp; No. 2.
                                    Truly pleased to hear that you are all in enjoyment of good health. It found me well
                                    and in better spirits than I have been since I left Hoosier soil. The climate is so
                                    exhilarating, and the society is in unison with the society I hold dear in Indiana.
                                    After being subject to Despotic o—rs [officers] for 15 months, our
                                    discipline has been suddenly relaxed. We have also been frowned on by all the
                                    Citizen Population that we have been thrown in contact with untill we came here. It
                                    is but natural that being treated as Gentlemen, after being denounced so long as
                                    hirelings, that our more tender feelings should be touched. I shall never forget the
                                    unmerited kindness that I have received from Citizens of Huntsville. If we go to
                                    Church, we are earnestly invited to share with them, their household pews. If we
                                    happen to a Tea party, we are always invited to participate. I have never been to
                                    but one house that I was welcomed, and invited to make the second Call.</p>

                        <p>I grasp my pen to write you a few lines to inform you that I am still enjoying good
                                    helth, and I hope this will find you the same. The weather is cool and clear with
                                    some snow on the mountains. It seems strange to see snow within three [miles] of us,
                                    and the ground not frozen here. But nevertheless it is the case.</p>
                        <p>I have the Blues today. My Boots are so near worn out that I cant go out of camp, and
                                    camp is too dull to chear one all the time. Our Recruits have arrived, 24 in number.
                                    But they are not armed yet, and it will be sometime before they will be. Three of
                                    them have got measles. I am not acquainted with any of them, as they are all from
                                    the South part of Clinton. George Brown has been more successful than I had
                                    anticipated. We havent got any mail since the first of the past week, as the train
                                    run off the track and blocked it up. But we expect the train in today.</p>
                        <p>I met two old cronies the other day, downtown [Huntsville]. They were Joseph
                                    &amp; Jim Aikens, formerly of Rossville. They now belong to the 17th <placeName>

                                    greatly surprised to meet me. They had just heard from Tom Goble and told me that
                                    Henry Smith was wounded and at home. It surprised me as you had rote nothing about
                                    it. Had Mohlers heard from Henry lately? I should like to hear from him.</p>

                        <p>The cars have come in, so I will wait till the mail is distributed. Well the mail has
                                    come. But nothing for me, so I have the Blues yet. I will close for the present.
                                    Please write soon and often. I remain your affectionate Son,</p>

                        <p>I take my pen in hand to drop you a few lines to inform you how I am getting along.
                                    This is a rainy morning. It has been raining all night and is still raining. I am
                                    very unwell. On last Monday my horse fell with me, and hurt my back. My back is so
                                    stiff yet, that I cant turn in bed. I am getting better, and I hope to be all right
                                    in a few days. We are under marching orders. But no time specified to move. I am
                                    afraid they will move before I am able to rise. Is so, I will have to go to the
                                    Hospital, and I dont fancy the idea.</p>
                        <p>Our recruits have joined us at last, 24 in number, and some of them are fine men. But
                                    the majority of them are to young to stand the service. Old Jacob Culver has a son
                                    here. He is 17 year old, and there is a William C. Spaulding, that use to sing with
                                    you during Odoud's musical administration, and he is a splendid singer
                                        yet.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

                                    pay, except Co. K. We wont get our pay for sometime yet. The reason we cant get our
                                    pay is because we have no commissioned officer to certify that the Pay Rolls is
                                    correct. It seems that this company is born to bad luck.</p>
                        <p>War news is scarce. It is reported by deserters that the Rebel Congress has passed a
                                    bill to emancipate all the slaves and families of slaves that will enlist in their
                                    Army. If true, it is a master stroke of Policy.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                                        freedom in return for fighting for the South. The proposal resulted in so much
                                        dissension that President Jefferson Davis ordered all discussion of the matter
                                        to cease. By the end of 1864, however, Davis was openly admitting that arming
                                        the slaves might well be inevitable. Although, in February, 1865, General Robert
                                        E. Lee also supported the idea, the Confederate Congress and most southern
                                        states remained adamantly opposed. Not until March 13, 1865, was a law passed
                                        authorizing the requisition of a quota of black soldiers from each state but not
                                        mandating freedom for them. Since the war, in effect, ended on April 9, 1865,

                                            areas occupied by northern armies, military commanders coped variously with
                                            the problems created by the fugitives who entered their lines. Funds to

                                            school described by Clark was supported by federal taxes. Some commanders
                                            appointed superintendents to oversee the blacks’ welfare, and

                        <p>Will Grissmer and I is (which is a sight) Bunking together. We have a fine house, 7
                                    feet square, four feet hight at the sides, and 72 feet high at the comb. A nice

                        <p>I received you welcome letter of the 15th just last night. It informed me of your
                                    continued good health, and that Jonas was going to move back onto the old hive. I
                                    hope it will be beneficial to all concerned. But it is a strange step, considering
                                    what has passed.</p>

                                    list, and consequently I had my choice, either to freeze, or make the purchases of

            <p>The American Civil War consisted of a vast accumulation of small tragedies that forever left a mark
                    upon Hoosier families. Scarcely an Indiana city, town, or village remained unaffected by the endless
                    casualty reports that came flooding in from every quarter of the conflict. The young men who marched
                    off from those towns in the early days of the war to the accompaniment of waving flags and brass
                    bands could not realize fully the sacrifice that would be demanded of them. During the course of the
                    rebellion Hoosiers marched and fought literally from the Potomac to the Rio Grande. The countryside
                    separating the two great rivers is marked by graves bearing quiet testimony to the extent of their
                    sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Joseph B. Gossett was one of those soldiers. The Honey Creek (<placeName>

                    Indiana played mostly a supporting role, was one of the most decisive Union victories of the war.
                    Grant virtually destroyed Pemberton. Broken and separated, the rebel units retreated in headlong
                    flight back toward the Vicksburg entrenchments. Grant caught up with them the next day and beat them
                    soundly at the <geogName>Big Black River</geogName> bridge. The Eighth Indiana was in the forefront
                    of this fight, a victory that resulted in the capture of about two thousand rebels and many
                    artillery pieces.</p>
            <p>Grant crossed the Big Black the next morning and on May 19 assaulted rebel fortifications that
                    honeycombed Vicksburg's imposing bluffs. The Federal attack was easily blunted, and
                    Grant's losses were considerable. In a second try, on May 22, the Federals hurled
                    themselves against the rebel works in a loosely coordinated end-to-end assault. The
                    Eighth's assignment was particularly tough as the Hoosiers moved down the Vicksburg-Jackson
                    railroad against a lunette occupied by the Second <placeName>

                                            written, with grammar and spelling uncorrected by the editor.
                                            Capitalization, too, remains as in Gossett's original, although

                                            "c" were sometimes arbitrary. Punctuation was supplied to
                                            facilitate reading as most of Gossett's original punctuation marks

                    It is our hope that this section, which aims to describe various archival holdings throughout

            <p>Fifty years after the end of World War II, the history of Indiana since 1945 remains the least
                    explored era of the state's past. Whether because of nostalgia, the political ramifications
                    of potential subjects, or a reluctance to confront those who are not safely dead, articles and books

            <p>Fortunately, Indiana archives contain materials that reveal not only the fascinating, complex, and
                    uneven changes that have combined to make the state more like the rest of modern America but also
                    the determination of some residents to preserve values and institutions that are believed to give
                    Indiana its distinctive identity. These manuscript collections, oral histories, photographs,
                    statistical databases, and other holdings offer a rich record of where Indianans have lived since
                    1945 and what they have done for a living. Included, too, are their responses to government
                    intervention and regulation and their concerns about such public issues as race relations,
                    environmentalism, education, gender roles, and the health of both industry and organized labor.</p>
            <p>These records also point to several potentially rewarding areas of research into Indiana's
                    recent past. State residents reacted with uncertainty to the emergence of new trends during and
                    after World War II, their apprehensions expressed most spectacularly in the <list type="footnotes">

                    commitment of governors to the proposition that local problems can best be solved by local
                    government, a reluctance to fund large-scale public works projects.</p>
            <p>Indiana during the 1950s was dominated not simply by the Republican party but also by an ideological
                    conservatism that generated as much internal conflict as it did discord between the state and the
                    federal government. On the one hand, the era was marked by the passage of a right-to-work law, the
                    only one in a northern industrial state; opposition to a Republican president's interstate
                    highway program; a short-lived anticommunist campaign; public policies maintained by an artificially
                    rural state legislature; and a state basketball championship won by all-white, small-town Milan High
                    School. On the other hand, a dwindling state surplus prompted tax reforms; a <geogName>Lake
                    Michigan</geogName> port site was purchased; several large, occasionally violent labor strikes
                    erupted, and 7,000 union members marched on the State House to protest right-to-work; school
                    consolidation grew, as did the interstate highway program and state government generally; the number
                    of women in the Indiana work force continued to increase; and a widening rift between what Indiana
                    was becoming and what its political leaders wanted it to remain resulted in the election in the late
                    1950s of the largest number of Democrats to state and congressional offices in a decade. Milan High
                    may continue to capture the Hoosier imagination, but the dominant basketball teams of the 1950s came
                    from the big-city, all-black Crispus Attucks High School.</p>
            <p>The wave of changes that took place during the 1960s and early 1970s resulted from more than the
                    election of Matthew E. Welsh, often dubbed Indiana's first "modern"
                    governor, and the reform spirit generated by the New Frontier and Great Society. Federal courts
                    forced reapportionment, which in turn led to a more urbanized General Assembly that at least
                    temporarily resolved the dispute over uniform time, repealed the poll tax and right-to-work law, and
                    established equal opportunity in housing and education. African Americans such as Gary Mayor Richard
                    G. Hatcher represented the growing political clout of Indiana blacks. College students forced the
                    repeal of old university rules, organized protests first over hefty tuition hikes and later over
                    larger issues, and fashioned a relatively durable counterculture. Women secured such legal gains as
                    an equal pay act and pushed for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Mayor Richard G. Lugar represented a (‘new Republicanism" that

            <p>For the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s Indianans sought to consolidate the changes that had
                    occurred and to establish a new equilibrium in public affairs. Otis R. Bowen personified at least
                    part of that search—a family doctor who as governor initiated far-reaching tax reform,
                    oversaw the completion of the federal highway program, and pushed for a greater state share of the
                    national GOPs "New Federalism." Elsewhere the balance was shakier. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> struggled to adapt to court-ordered busing. The General Assembly ratified the ERA, then
                    rescinded its decision. Environmentalists and others kept nuclear power plants out of the state, but
                    air and water pollution persisted. And the Indiana economy was not only beleaguered by three
                    recessions between the mid-1970s and early 1980s but also by a long-term structural decline in
                    manufacturing that contributed to a post-World War II unemployment high of 14 percent in 1982.</p>
            <p>Indiana's most recent history continues to present a mixed picture. Public and private
                    interests have made strenuous efforts to redirect the state's economy, endeavors that are
                    exemplified by Indianapolis's campaign to become a sports and entertainment center. Yet
                    Gary's Genesis Plan for urban revitalization collapsed, the decline of family farming
                    reached crisis proportions in the 1980s, and problems first addressed in the 1960s remained
                    unresolved. Indianans thus continue to be engaged in a process that has faced residents for five
                    decades: the reconciliation of modernity with emotions and traditions that influence memories and
                    perceptions of Indiana.</p>
            <p>The following essays highlight the most promising kinds of archival materials available to those
                    interested in studying Indiana's history since 1945. Robert Horton discusses the particular
                    intellectual equipment one needs when using state government records at the Indiana State Archives.
                    In complementary contributions on relevant resources at the Indiana Historical Society, Alexandra S.
                    Gressitt surveys collections that reflect changes in the economy, religious life, politics, and
                    status of women in postwar Indiana, while Wilma L. Gibbs identifies specific holdings that document
                    the efforts of African Americans in <placeName>

                    McShane describes several ways of studying the multiethnic, multifaceted, and tumultuous history of
                    northwest Indiana at the Calumet Regional Archives, located at Indiana University Northwest in Gary.</p>

                    begin in earnest. Future articles in the Archives Section will focus on other eras and subjects and
                    will also be designed to encourage further research and writing on Indiana and midwestern history.</p>

            <p rend="center">INDIANA STATE ARCHIVES</p>
            <p>One of the notable themes in the history of post-World War II Indiana is the explosive growth of
                    Indiana government, one consequence of which is the corresponding growth in government records as
                    agencies are created, expand in size, and encompass greater responsibilities. Office technology has
                    compounded that growth by introducing computers, photocopiers, word processors, laser printers, and
                    electronic mail, all making the generation of records simpler and faster.</p>
            <p>For the archivist and the researcher the results are daunting: there are enormous amounts of material
                    to analyze and process. At the Indiana State Archives the response has been to develop, at the
                    agency level, a records management scheme to determine what should be destroyed and what should be
                    permanently preserved. Accordingly, most agencies in state government have for each discrete set of
                    records a retention schedule that describes the material and outlines its
                        "fate."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Researchers should be aware of these schedules,
                    as records may be destined for a journey of fifteen years or more before they reach either the
                    Archives or the shredder. That span represents a considerable portion of the postwar period.</p>
            <p>Ideally, the retention schedule system allows researchers to determine the location of any record at
                    any point during its "life cycle." Archivists and researchers, however, need to be
                    aware of the ways in which governmental considerations (such as the status and development of
                    agencies) and technological considerations (such as the advent of electronic media) affect the
                    preservation of government records. Certain agencies, such as the Lottery Commission, are exempted
                    entirely from the records management scheme. In addition, those parts of state government enjoying a
                    relatively privileged status can control their own documentary history. The principal objects of
                    interest here are the General Assembly and the Governor's Office.</p>
            <p>Historically, the General Assembly has produced a paucity of records. No equivalent of the <hi rend="i">Congressional Record</hi> exists; thus, there are no texts of floor debates or
                    committee deliberations. The Assembly's only publications, the House and Senate journals,
                    note only the progress of a bill through the legislature. From these sources it is extremely
                    difficult to discern anything like legislative intent.</p>

               <item>
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In Indiana the process began in 1978 with the formation of the Indiana
                        Commission on Public Records (ICPR), the parent agency of the Indiana State Archives. The
                        records management division, in cooperation with the agency involved, develops the retention
                        schedules. In the years since 1978 many, but not all, agencies in state government have been
                        scheduled. The ICPR's retention schedule database is now available on-line at the State
                        Archives’ World Wide Web site.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-091-3-092"/>
            <p>One way around this impasse is the use of reports coming from the Legislative Services Agency. The
                    General Assembly routinely establishes standing and interim study committees that meet between
                    sessions to research and recommend policy on a variety of topics, Recent concerns addressed by
                    committees include the lack of secure storage space in the State Archives, workplace safety,
                    education, and the problems faced by black males. Because of the need to account to the full
                    Assembly, the committees generate a variety of records; at the very least they produce a final
                    report but sometimes, as well, transcripts of testimony or minutes of meetings.</p>
            <p>Like the General Assembly, the Governor's Office is not considered subject to the public
                    records law. Although most postwar governors do have records at the Archives, the materials therein
                    do not necessarily constitute a full history of the various administrations. Roger D.
                    Branigin's official papers, for example, are largely at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. Personal papers, a category sometimes, one suspects, generously construed, are
                    never brought to the Archives. When Robert D. Orr left office, his staff left eight years of records
                    in dumpsters behind the State House; fortunately, the Archives’ staff staged a rescue
                    which brought hundreds of cubic feet of material to safety. It seems, though, that before being
                    dumped the files were sanitized; post-Watergate, it can be assumed that such a procedure is and will
                    be increasingly routine.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nonetheless, governors' papers are the single most important source to research for two
                    reasons: (1) the office's involvement in all aspects of government generally guarantees
                    some mention of a public issue; and (2) the Archives has produced useful finding aids that greatly
                    facilitate access to the collections. Despite their drawbacks the Governors' Papers remain
                    the necessary starting point for research in postwar records.</p>
            <p>The attraction of records originating in the General Assembly and the Governor's Office
                    lies, of course, in their catholicity. Agency records, on the other hand, are less appealing because
                    of their irregularity, the foremost cause of which is the mutability of things: especially since
                    1945 state government has suffered continuing consolidation and fragmentation as it forms and
                    re-forms itself in response to social changes and demands. Understanding this flux is critical
                    because, as the principle of <hi rend="i">respect des fonds</hi> governs the archival treatment of
                    records, all documents are kept in the order in which they are received at the Archives. They are
                    not rearranged or reclassified. Researchers, accordingly, have to determine who created the records
                    in order to find them, a process that is rarely simple.</p>

            <p>One of the most important developments in postwar history, for example, has been the increased
                    concern for the environment. Within state government all of the following agencies have missions in
                    some way related to the topic: the Department of Natural Resources, formed in 1965, principally
                    incorporating the old Department of Conservation; the Department of Environmental Management (IDEM),
                    formed in 1985 from portions of several agencies; the Utility Regulatory Commission, before 1988 the
                    Public Service Commission; the Utility Consumer Council, formed in 1981; the Pesticide Review Board,
                    1971; the Hazardous Waste Facility Site Approval Authority, 1981; the <geogName>Ohio River
                    Valley</geogName> Sanitation Commission, 1939. Then, despite the all-encompassing concerns of these
                    agencies, there are anomalies such as the Department of Health's special report on the
                    Marble Hill nuclear plant, six cubic feet of records relating to a critical decision about
                    Indiana's environment.</p>
            <p>Untangling these knots is just the first phase of any researcher's project. Once a
                    particular thread is identified, there remains the task of tracing the variety of documents that
                    every agency produces. One possible impediment is confidentiality: all agencies produce some records
                    that are deemed confidential, either permanently, such as adoption records, or for seventy-five
                    years, such as hospital records. Other government records can be broadly categorized as minutes,
                    financial records, correspondence, publications, and administrative materials.</p>
            <p>Minutes are deemed critical records, thus are scheduled to be preserved completely and permanently at
                    the Archives. Their value to the researcher lies in their overview of an agency's mission
                    and in their account of all significant decisions. Financial records are copiously generated in the
                    normal course of business but are not destined for long-term retention except in compiled formats.
                    The routine is to keep these records only long enough for the State Board of Accounts to complete an
                    audit and to satisfy any particular statutory obligation.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Correspondence is
                    scheduled according to content. The retention period for "general" correspondence
                    is three years in-house and then disposal. "Policy" correspondence, on the other
                    hand, is transferred to the Archives after three years for evaluation. Publications are not normally
                    sent to the Archives; under a longstanding division of labor, the Indiana Division of the State
                    Library assumes responsibility for printed materials.</p>
            <p>Retention schedules for administrative materials reflect a number of considerations. From the
                    perspective of the agency producing the records, the foremost concerns are statutory obligations and
                    the <list type="footnotes">

                    focus of a "risk analysis," which determines the perfect balance of safety and
                    frugality but which changes over time. Environmental records, for example, have become increasingly
                    significant. As a result, IDEM is now exploring the use of imaging, a very expensive but potentially
                    much more secure and flexible alternative to paper. Other agencies, too, plan the transition to
                    electronic records, a course that would revolutionize record keeping and record access.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>With the Internet patrons and researchers now have the potential to connect directly to the
                    government's electronic records. Indiana has already taken some steps to facilitate this
                    process; the Information Services Division of the Department of Administration has created World
                    Wide Web sites for, among other agencies, the State Archives, the Criminal Justice Institute, and
                    the State Election Board. As a result, a number of records are now on-line. Whether this service
                    grows is contingent on a number of factors, but principally on the state's budget. Given
                    the financial restrictions that government agencies face, their capacity to make large capital
                    investments in technology is limited. No matter what eventually takes shape, however, the concept of
                    an "archives" will be drastically affected. The "paperless
                    office" will probably never exist, but paper documents will undoubtedly serve ancillary and
                    ephemeral roles in a predominantly electronic process, with all that that implies.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Determining the whys and wherefores of government actions, already difficult, may well

            <p>Several good collections reflecting the role that women have played in politics in Indiana are
                    available. With two of these collections, The League of Women Voters of Indiana (M 612) and The

                    </placeName> (M 611), researchers have the enviable opportunity to use resources spanning nearly the
                    entire twentieth century. More activist materials are available in the Indiana NOW records (M 583)
                    and in the papers of Julia Strain Fangmeir (M 637), educator, minister, and political activist;
                    Joline Ohmart (M 610), political activist for equal rights and employment standards; Lee Ellen Ford

            <p>Politicians’ papers always provide an interesting perspective in understanding the
                    concerns of an era. Some representative collections include the papers of Cecil Harden (M 5841, a
                    five-term Republican congresswoman from western Indiana; Martha Ellis Hopkins (M 146), Republican
                    party leader; and James P. Fadely (M 6511, educator and Democratic political candidate. Judicial and
                    legal issues are more difficult to chronicle, in large part because of client privacy rights.
                    Although an incomplete record, the correspondence and petitions addressed to the Indiana Supreme
                    Court concerning Paula Cooper's (M 565) 1986 death sentence helps to illustrate the
                    state's social consciousness. The Indiana Historical Society also has an invaluable
                    resource in the Senior Lawyers Project (M 574), a collection of oral histories in which leading
                    attorneys cover such wide-ranging topics as rural electrification, legal culture, civil rights, and <placeName>

            <p>An area that is not as well documented, in part because people in a rapidly advancing technological
                    society place little value on contemporary materials—the
                    "they-are-valuable-only-if-they-are-really-old syndrome—and in part because
                    technological advances have altered people's lives, are personal papers of typical everyday
                    citizens. In the past, people without access to instant gratification —movies,
                    television, radio, etc.—created their own entertainment. They kept diaries and journals
                    and wrote lengthy letters, skits, short stories, and miscellanies, sometimes dreary but more often
                    eloquent, and occasionally so graphic as to rival our contemporary soap operas. In recording so
                    voluminously their ideas, activities, hopes, and fears, they secured for themselves an assured niche
                    in history. Today, with instant electronic communication, there is diminishing hope of establishing
                    an accurate record of the daily lives of ordinary citizens. Even those who do maintain
                    correspondence, or keep diaries or journals, do so with less reflection, less eloquence, and
                    frequently with such terseness as to be questionably useful. The papers of Joann Walters (M 150), a
                    contemporary <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-091-3-097"/> Hoosier, are a notable exception, with widely
                    ranging correspondents providing insight into some of the problems faced by women in the last
                    quarter of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>In part oral histories have been utilized to fill the informational void created by the absence of
                    written records. The Senior Lawyers Project is a good example, as are two different interviews, one
                    conducted by James H. Madison (SC 2254) with Evelyn Fortune Bartlett and Madeline Fortune Elder,
                    daughters of William Fortune, a prominent <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> figure, and one by Charles Latham (SC 2303) with Bartlett, Elder, and William Lemcke
                    Fortune, grandson of William Fortune.</p>
            <p>These and many other holdings at the Indiana Historical Society reflect the diversity of a post-World
                    War II Indiana in which people engaged in myriad new activities and expanded old ones. Many of the
                    changes involved dramatic advances by African Americans in the state, and the Indiana Historical
                    Society's collections offer numerous examples of individual and organizational efforts to
                    secure racial and civic equality.</p>

            <p>The Indiana Historical Society has scores of collections that pertain to the history of African
                    Americans in Indiana. Several collections have been gathered from a variety of sources and donors
                    under the auspices of the Black History Program. Created to address the paucity of materials
                    available for researching Indiana African-American history, the Program officially began in 1982,
                    and its quarterly newsletter, <hi rend="i">Black History News</hi> &amp; Notes, publicizes
                    collections and publishes articles that utilize them. During the early 1980s the Society was one of

                    gather manuscripts and photographs related to African-American women within the two-state area. The
                    undertaking, directed by Darlene Clark Hine, netted the Society fifty collections, including the
                    project's administrative records.</p>
            <p>Numerous collections provide glimpses of the recent history of African Americans in Indiana. Several
                    of the personal papers are useful because they include materials that denote the work of civic
                    leaders, many of whom were involved with multiple organizations and causes. Especially noteworthy
                    are the papers of Robert Broken-burr (M 4921, Jesse L. Dickinson (M 5321, Harvey N. Middleton (M

                    Christian Association, United Negro College Fund, the National Association for the Advancement of
                    Colored People, and the Meharry Medical College Alumni Association. Forever an advocate, Henry J.
                    Richardson, Jr., was one of the first blacks to be elected to the Indiana General Assembly in the
                    twentieth century. His collection gives an excellent overview of the advances in civil rights in the
                    state since 1932. Roselyn Richardson has also been very active in numerous civic, religious,
                    educational, and political organizations. Her collection contains the records of the Career Sampling
                    Program, an educational initiative that she began in 1973 at Shortridge High School, part of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> public school system.</p>
            <p>In the spirit of self-help and volunteerism, several agencies, institutions, and clubs developed or
                    adjusted their emphasis to address the social, health, educational, and recreational needs of a
                    changing population during the post-World War II period. Many of the women's clubs that
                    developed prior to World War I, under the umbrella of the Indiana State Federation of Colored
                    Women's Clubs, touted the banner of racial or moral uplift. Club work often addressed
                    critical health needs of the community. Records for the Woman's Improvement Club (M 432)
                    reflect its work with an early open air tuberculosis camp. Responding to the need for health
                    facilities for African Americans, the Grand Body of the Sisters of Charity (M 619) opened a hospital
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1911. The records of the Sojourner Truth Club (M 540) reveal the activities of
                    clubwomen in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although all of these clubs have some materials that date from the post-World War II
                    period, evidence suggests that the focus of many of their activities changed from solving critical
                    social issues to being more recreational in nature. Recent health strides can be seen in the papers
                    (M 510) of Walter Maddux, M.D., who helped found the Herman G. Morgan Health Center in 1943.</p>

                    such as hotels, restaurants, and recreational areas. Around the state a few cities instituted
                    successful reforms before the passage of the Indiana school desegregation law in 1949. The Henry J.

            <p>Many Indiana colleges and universities significantly increased their enrollment of black students
                    during the 1960s. Demographic trends suggest that these numbers will continue to grow. Institutions
                    of higher education have identified in-house strategies to support their more diverse student
                    bodies. State, regional, and national organizations have been formed to meet the academic,
                    financial, and sociocultural needs of minority, disabled, andfor dis-advantaged students. The
                    Indiana Mid-American Association of Educational Opportunity Programs Personnel Collection, 1975-1989
                    (M 6151, describes one organization's efforts to promote secondary and postsecondary
                    programs that supported the needs of nontraditional students.</p>
            <p>In more recent years smaller, private colleges have also actively recruited a more diverse student
                    population. Like public universities, these private institutions have noted problems with black
                    student population and retention. During the 1980s <placeName>

            <p>The post—World War II period witnessed the establishment of many grocery stores, service
                    garages, dry cleaning shops, nightclubs, billiard halls, and restaurants owned by African Americans
                    throughout the state. Before the 1960s a highly segregated African-American community supported
                    black-owned businesses, especially in service industries. Two early businesses that continue to
                    exist, <pb n="338" id="VAA4025-091-3-100"/> under different ownership, are the Madam C. J. Walker

            <p>The limited number and lack of geographical and denominational diversity of church records at the
                    Indiana Historical Society does not reflect the role and influence that religious institutions have
                    had in the lives of black Hoosiers. Although the Baptists can claim the largest church membership
                    statewide, the African Methodist Episcopal, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion, Christian
                    Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, Christian, Catholic, Pentecostal, and Muslim denominations have a

            <p>In its short life span the Black History Program has gathered an impressive group of collections. A
                    major challenge remains the collection of papers and records that will reflect the everyday lives
                    and varied activities of African Americans in all areas of the state.</p>
            <p rend="center">DOCUMENTING "INDIANA'S LAST FRONTIER: THE CALUMET REGIONAL ARCHIVES</p>
            <p>In 1959 Professor Powell A. Moore published his classic history of northwest Indiana entitled <hi rend="i">The Calumet Region: Indiana's Last Frontier.</hi> Moore chose his subtitle to
                    illustrate the point that <placeName>

                    </placeName> served as the final major areas of settlement in the nineteenth state. Although the
                    "State of Lake's" development began later than its southern neighbors,
                    its brief past remains one of the most fascinating and colorful subjects in Hoosier history. The
                    study of the Calumet's history, however, could also be dubbed "Indiana's
                    Last Historical Frontier." Only since 1959 has northwest Indiana received serious attention
                    from professional historians; but as greater numbers of researchers probe the Calumet's
                    past, they will find a repository of primary research materials awaiting them in the Calumet
                    Regional Archives.</p>
            <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-091-3-101"/>
            <p>The youth of the Archives, established in 1973, reflects that of the Region. Primarily
                    twentieth-century in scope, the repository contains over 360 distinct archival and manuscript
                    collections that furnish information on the history of the arts and music in the area; African
                    Americans, Latinos, and other ethnic groups; education; environmentalism; health; industry; labor;
                    politics; recreation; women; and other topics. Correspondence, minutes, scrapbooks, programs,
                    pamphlets, reports, photographs, and maps, as well as films, videotapes, and sound recordings, are
                    collected and preserved. Many of the collections are small, yet they offer information unavailable
                    anywhere else.</p>
            <p>The holdings of the Calumet Regional Archives are particularly well suited to the study of Indiana in
                    the post-1945 period. The themes of the recent past include the emergence of environmental
                    movements, the rise and decline of industrial unions, civil rightslminority power campaigns, and
                    crime and political corruption. While the Archives holds a number of collections on these subjects,
                    a few of the more useful sources are highlighted below.</p>

            <p>In the early 1950s one segment of the population began to view the continued industrialization of
                    northwest Indiana with alarm. Stimulated by Bethlehem Steel's plans to build a new mill in
                    the Indiana Dunes, along with the Port of Indiana project, a group of Ogden Dunes women founded the
                    Save the Dunes Council in 1952; the Council ultimately succeeded in winning an Indiana Dunes
                    National Lakeshore in 1966. The Save the Dunes Council Records (CRA 149) include minutes,
                    correspondence, articles, and other records describing this grassroots effort. In addition to the
                    Council records, several leaders of this group have donated their personal papers. Of particular
                    interest are those of Thomas Dustin, the Council's publicity director (CRA 1131, Alton A.
                    Lindsey, a scientist advisor (CRA 1181, Sylvia <placeName>

                    attorney for the Concerned Citizens group (CRA 1831, detail the legal maneuverings leading to the
                    project's cancellation.</p>

            <p>Industrial unionism has served as a major theme in the history of northwest Indiana. The post-1945
                    period saw the rapid rise of the United Steel workers of America (USWA) to a position of incredible
                    power in the Calumet Region. Interestingly, union influence declined in just thirty years, as the
                    changing economy, loss of jobs, and internal strife weakened steelworker power by 1982.</p>
            <p>The Calumet Regional Archives holds thirty collections, contributed by union locals and labor
                    leaders, related to the history of the USWA. The USWA Local 1010 (Inland Steel, East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>) Records (CRA 115) are the most complete. The collection's strength is its
                    coverage of the 1940-1965 period detailing the local's positions regarding wages, hours,
                    and working conditions. A series of files offers useful data on several major strikes during the
                    era, particularly the 116-day steel strike in 1959. Other major collections on the USWA include the
                    USWA Local 1011 (LTV Steel, East <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>) Records (CRA 1211, the John Mayerik (USS Gary Works, Local 1014) Papers (CRA 1681, and
                    the USWA Local 6787 (<placeName>

                    </placeName>) Records (CRA 228). Of special interest are the E. Thomas Colosimo Papers (CRA 325),
                    which contain a run of a local steelworkers newspaper exhibiting an alternative point of view to the
                    mainstream union pronunciations of the period.</p>
            <p>The growing rift between the steelworkers' international union leadership and the
                    rank-and-file membership exploded in the Region in the early 1970s as steelworkers split during the
                    USWA District 31 election. The Samuel Evett Papers (CRA 137) offer insight into the disunity within
                    the union, a fact that contributed to the demise of steelworker strength in the 1970s. Union power
                    suffered even further as the 1980s began, as many local industrial plants either reduced their labor
                    forces or simply closed their doors—the 1982 recession was especially hard on the Calumet
                    Region. A collection of personal papers from Terry Steagall (CRA 31) contains materials related to
                    many union locals as well as plant closings during this period and helps to document the lessening
                    power of organized labor in this bastion of union strength.</p>

            <p>The struggle for civil rights in northwest Indiana mirrored events nationally. Although the election

                        <settlement type="city">American city</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Gary) is <pb n="341" id="VAA4025-091-3-103"/> often identified with the rise of local
                    black political power, events in the 1940s and 1950s paved the way for Hatcher's 1967
                    victory. In documenting this subject, the Archives has had to rely on personal collections. Among
                    early civil rights events were the desegregation of Miller Beach along <geogName>Lake
                    Michigan</geogName> and the employment of African Americans in Gary's downtown department
                    stores. The Clifford E. Minton Papers (CRA 160) chronicle those episodes and much more; Minton
                    headed the Gary Urban League from 1949 to 1965. A brief record of the Gary NAACP activities can be
                    found in the Jeanette Strong Papers (CRA 79)) which include photographs of an open housing march
                    down <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Broadway</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1963.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the Archives lacks the papers of Richard Hatcher, but various small collections
                    attempt to provide some information on the Hatcher era, 1967-1987. For example, the Archives has
                    begun a Richard Hatcher Collection (CRA 861, a grouping of discrete items about the mayor. Included
                    are items such as campaign materials and photographs. The Henry Coleman Papers (CRA 277) contain
                    various reports and news articles about the Hatcher elections in 1967 and 1971 and the city
                    controller's office in the early 1970s. Correspondence, memoranda, speeches, programs, and
                    campaign materials in the Charlene Crowell Papers (CRA 321) furnish information on the later years
                    of the Hatcher administration. Finally, a few materials about the Gary Human Relations Commission
                    and various <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hatcher city</settlement>
                    </placeName> programs are housed in the Leonard Dreyfus Papers (CRA 268).</p>
            <p>In addition to the voices of African Americans seeking social justice, Latinos began to gain greater
                    visibility in the political and social arena. Current collections include the Nicolas Kanellos
                    Papers (CRA 273), which encompass records of the Concerned Latins Organization, established to
                    promote greater sensitivity to Latino concerns in education and local government. The Abe Morales
                    Papers (CRA 260) provide some data on the Gary Latin American Democrats, while the Manuel and Louise
                    Martinez Papers (CRA 253) include materials about local League of United Latin American Citizens
                    (LULAC) activities.</p>

                </p>
            <p>One of the most persistent images of the Calumet Region centers on its reputation as a
                    "wide-open" area, home to organized crime leaders and corrupt politicians. This
                    legacy began in the Prohibition era and continued into the post-1945 period as vice dens
                    proliferated and local politicians were investigated by congressional committees and sometimes
                    convicted and removed from office. The Archives has preserved several collections relating to this
                    more colorful aspect of the Region's recent past.</p>
            <p>In 1949 the senseless killing of a popular Gary schoolteacher prompted a group of outraged women to
                    action. The Women's Citizens <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-091-3-104"/> Committee (WCC) began a
                    crusade to clean up Gary and rid the city of vice and corruption. The Women's Citizens
                    Committee Records (CRA 30) document these efforts, which gained national exposure. The Northwest
                    Indiana Crime Commission succeeded the WCC in the late 1950s. The papers of Elmer Jacobsen (CRA
                    3091, director of the crime commission from 1965 to its demise in 1975, contain minutes,
                    correspondence, and subject files on topics ranging from corruption to gambling to prostitution. One
                    of the politicians falling from grace in this period was Gary Mayor George Chacharis, who was sent

               <hi rend="i">Nixon Reconsidered.</hi> By Joan Hoff. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Basic Books, 1994. Pp. xviii, 475. Notes, bibliography, index. $30.00.)</head>
            <p>This deeply researched book, the principal revisionist account of the Richard M. Nixon
                    administration, is divided into three parts. The first discusses Nixon's domestic political
                    agenda. The second treats Nixon's foreign policy, and the third evaluates Watergate. Joan
                    Hoff, who had unprecedented access to Nixon, consciously turns on their head all of the customary
                    evaluations of Nixon's activities while president. Earlier observers praised his foreign
                    policy, condemned his domestic policy as mean and angry, and claimed that Nixon always would be
                    remembered for disgracing the presidency during Watergate, a major constitutional crisis. Hoff,
                    however, argues that Nixon's greatest achievements were in the field of domestic policy.
                    She considers his foreign policy largely a failure, based on an unhealthy personal relationship with
                    Henry A. Kissinger. As for Watergate, she believes it was a relatively minor scandal. Future
                    generations, she predicts, will probably remember Watergate much as current historians think about
                    Teapot Dome.</p>
            <p>What is one to make of all this combative revisionism? Hoff stands on the firmest ground in her
                    criticism of Nixon's foreign policy, precisely the area in which her analysis is the least
                    unconventional. Here her quarrel is not so much with historians as with the mass media who glorified
                    Nixon's foreign policy while he was president and who argued that it was his one worthy
                    achievement. It was in foreign policy, however, that the bad Nixon—the secretive,
                    suspicious, manipulative man of the cartoons and the standard version—stood out. In
                    Nixon's account, assinger's recollections, and the mass media of the day, the
                    president's long daily meetings and endless telephone calls with Kwsinger demonstrated a
                    keen intelligence searching out the best minds of the establishment for solutions to the vexing
                    problems of the Cold War. Hoff, however, believes that the two men spent too much time together for
                    their own good. Theirs was an unhealthy relationship. Isolated from the voices of people who had
                    more sense about foreign policy, Nixon and Kissinger created a policy that could not stand the test
                    of time. Far from creating a structure of peace, as they claimed at the time, their foreign policy
                    was based on sleight of hand. Dktente seemed to fail, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-vnNorth">Vietnam</country>
                    </placeName> policy was a bloody debacle, <placeName>
                        <country reg="ir">Iran</country>
                    </placeName> soon succumbed to revolution. Only the opening to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> led to lasting achievements. Even here, Nixon and assinger were never able to square
                    the circle of opening relations with Beijing and maintaining them with Taiwan. Only Jimmy Carter was
                    willing to take the opening to <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> to its logical conclusion and establish diplomatic relations with Beijing and end them
                    with Taiwan.</p>
            <pb n="344" id="VAA4025-091-3-106"/>
            <p>Hoff s account of Nixon's domestic political achievements is fresher and is likely to be
                    more enduring. Historians and public affairs analysts have long puzzled over the fact that Nixon ran
                    on a more liberal domestic platform in 1972 than did any Republican or <hi rend="i">any
                    Democratic</hi> presidential nominee from 1976 until 1992. Hoff goes through enormous, even tedious,
                    detail to demonstrate that Nixon's domestic policies helped protect the environment,
                    enhanced the status of women, and advanced the position of Native Americans in American society. In
                    that sense Hoff's Nixon is indeed the man whom Garry Wills characterized as "the
                    last liberal." Wills was being ironic, and he also placed Nixon squarely in the context of
                    nineteenth-century marketplace liberalism. Hoff, however, argues that Nixon was really a
                    twentieth-century progressive Republican.</p>
            <p>There is an explanation for Nixon's expansion of the federal government's programs
                    to assist previously excluded groups. Public opinion did not turn on a dime and reject the reforms
                    of the Great Society in 1968. Even the white backlash, exploited successfully by both George C.
                    Wallace's presidential campaign and Nixon's southern strategy, did not reject
                    government programs in the way conservatives and libertarians of the 1980s and 1990s would do. White
                    working class voters might have believed in the late 1960s that Lyndon B. Johnson had gone too far
                    in diverting government resources from them, but they welcomed government programs that they
                    believed would benefit them. Tom Wicker characterized Nixon as "one of us,)) meaning that
                    he gripped the pulse of the American electorate as did no other national leader in the forty years
                    after 1945. He expressed the hopes and also the fears, anxieties, and anger of two generations of
                    Americans. In the late 1960s and early 1970s most people had not given up on the federal government
                    as a positive force. Neither had Nixon. More and more voters wanted harsher government actions
                    against crime, and many had lost patience with the claims of the poor. Nixon fed this anger too.</p>
            <p>Hoff's discussion of Nixon's domestic policy is the strongest part of her book.
                    Ironically, it is also the hardest to read. Every government agency has an acronym, and the letters
                    strewn across the page make for some heavy reading. In that regard, Hoffs account of
                    Nixon's domestic policy resembles nothing so much as Margaret Thatcher's
                    description in her memoirs of what she accomplished in the domestic field. Unlike Nixon who wanted
                    to modify and occasionally expand the welfare state, Thatcher was a conservative, committed to
                    dismantling the social programs constructed by British governments since the Second World War. But
                    both Hoff and Thatcher love to write in acronyms.</p>
            <p>At one point Hoff considered writing about "Nixon without Watergate," but friends
                    told her she had to deal with the scandal <pb n="345" id="VAA4025-091-3-107"/> that eventually
                    brought the president down. The section on Watergate is the weakest in the book. Hoff clearly is
                    uncomfortable writing about it, and her account really is not all that different from
                    Nixon's: he was not that deeply involved; others in the administration did the really bad
                    things; previous presidents had done much worse; it was not a constitutional crisis; the reforms
                    created in the wake of Watergate have not worked that well; and in fifty years people will not
                    remember it anyway. None of these assertions, with perhaps the sad exception of the last, rings
                    true. Hoff has not successfully rebutted Stanley [. Kutler's richly detailed account, <hi rend="i">The Wars of Watergate</hi> (1990). Moreover, the publication of H. R.
                    Haldeman's diary weeks after Nixon's death in 1994 revived public memories of the
                    spiteful conniving Nixon.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> have largely ignored William Fortune, focusing instead on the city's most
                    prominent industrialists (the Lillys, James Allison), automotive pioneers (Carl Fisher, Harry
                    Stutz), major retailers (the Ayres family), and leading literary lights (James Whitcomb Riley, Booth
                    Tarkington). Yet Fortune played a prominent role in the community's development for half a
                    century, especially in the "golden" years from 1890 to 1920. Charles
                    Latham's short, engagingly written biography, based on thorough research in primary
                    materials, is thus a welcome addition to the canon of Indiana biographies as well as to the
                    historiography of the Hoosier capital.</p>
            <p>Fortune was born in Boonville, Indiana. Work on the Boonville Standard beginning in his early teens,
                    as well as extensive personal reading, provided much of his education. In 1882 he moved to the state
                    capital, where he initially pursued a newspaper career—first on the Journal, then with
                    the News. He subsequently published a trade magazine, <hi rend="i">Municipal Engineering</hi>;
                    headed several local telephone companies (he placed the first dial call in the city); and served on
                    the board of the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and Company.</p>
            <p>Beginning about 1890 Fortune sought ways, in Latham's words, "to be an agent of
                    civic improvement" (p. 36). He worked closely with Colonel Eli Lilly in founding the
                    Commercial Club (later the Chamber of Commerce) and thereafter coordinated several of the
                    organization's very important initiatives for municipal progress. During the First World
                    War he was one of the founders of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> chapter of the Red Cross; he continued to lead the local <pb n="346" id="VAA4025-091-3-108"/> chapter throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as well as serving on the
                    central committee of the national Red Cross. He also presided over the city's fund-raising
                    efforts for the War Chest in 1918. Latham relates these public activities, as well as much about
                    Fortune's private life, with an eye for interesting details and telling anecdotes.</p>
            <p>The breadth of Fortune's business concerns and civic activities, as well as his acquaintance
                    with most of the city's movers and shakers, ensures that this volume will be frequently
                    consulted by those with interests in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> history. It is thus regrettable that the author and his publisher did not exercise
                    greater care in its production. Instances of editorial laxity abound. The location of several
                    important manuscript sources is not given, for example; and although dozens of endnotes refer to
                    materials in "WF or "WFII," these collections are not included in the
                    list of abbreviations. Many individuals and families go unidentified; the assumption seems to be
                    that since the author knows who these people are, the reader will too. Finally, and most serious,
                    are the multiple errors in citation. In Chapter 11, for instance, there is no note number 1 in the
                    text; there are two note 12s and two note 21s; and there is no note 26 in the text in spite of the
                    fact that there is an endnote with that number. Neatness counts; and, fairly or not, the
                    author's scholarship and the publisher's commitment to excellence will be called
                    into question by such inattention to detail.</p>
            <p>That said, this is a book that those interested in Indiana's capital, especially for the
                    years around the turn of the twentieth century, will find both useful and entertaining.

            <p>This book will appeal to two audiences—devotees of Indiana history and scholarly
                    researchers into nineteenth-century labor history. Although the study is densely detailed and
                    closely argued, both groups will find the time spent with it to be worthwhile.</p>
            <p>Readers interested in Indiana history will find a richly documented account of the social, economic,
                    and political development of two medium-sized cities, <placeName>

                    exercised by Washington C. DePauw. They will also deepen their understanding of the evolution of
                    Indiana politics in the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>Much of the approach of <hi rend="i">Producers, Proletarians, and Politicians</hi> will be familiar
                    to scholarly readers. The microcosmic case study is a common format for labor history. In addition,
                    Lipin's analysis of the persistence of artisan workshops amid economic development and the
                    roles of social organizations such as the Odd Fellows and volunteer fire companies echoes Bruce
                    Laurie's work on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His exploration of interclass relations in a non-metropolitan setting is reminiscent
                    of Herbert G. Gutman's treatment of Paterson, <placeName>

                    </placeName>; his assessment of the impact of the Civil War on economic growth, class relations, and

                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>'s work. Lipin not only lives up to the standards of these scholars but, in his
                    careful case studies, also manages to deepen the current understanding of issues discussed in their
                    works. Far from merely confirming previous arguments, he has made solid contributions of his own.</p>
            <p>One of the more interesting topics in this book is Lipin's discussion of the relationship
                    between political activism and trade unionism. It was long an article of faith within labor history
                    that political and trade union activity appeared in alternating cycles linked to the ups and downs
                    of the economy. When the economy was expanding, trade unionism dominated; but when the economy
                    turned down, political activity consumed the energy of the working class. Lipin's argument
                    flies past this old saw and demonstrates that political activism and ideologies often fueled trade
                    unionism.</p>
            <p>The author's analysis of local politics explores the entire culture of political activity
                    rather than electoral campaigns or the behavior of officeholders alone. In ward meetings, rallies,
                    parades, and political back rooms, Lipin finds an interaction between middle-class political figures
                    and working-class activists that, far from blocking an emergent working-class consciousness,
                    encourages "working-class assertiveness" through an "anti-aristocratic
                    rhetoric" which, at times, articulates a new language of class.</p>
            <p>Lipin finds this process much more fully developed in <placeName>

                    Lipin's careful research does not lead him to leap to the conclusion that American
                    working-class consciousness was at its prime before full-scale industrialization. Rather, it was the

                    </placeName> Law School, Kenyon Cox was well situated to absorb an appreciation of the value of high
                    ideals and civil responsibility. Kenyon's mother, Helen, however, was the family's
                    primary agent of idealism, and her influence on Kenyon was especially pronounced because of a
                    prolonged childhood illness that kept him at home in her care. H. Wayne Morgan makes clear in his
                    biography of this significant American artist that these early influences were extremely important
                    factors in the development of Cox's classical style as a painter and his antimodernist
                    stance as a critic.</p>
            <p>This biography of Cox follows logically upon three of Morgan's previous publications: <hi rend="i">New Muses: Art in American Culture, 1865-1920</hi> (1978), <hi rend="i">An American Art

                    (1989). With thorough research and serviceable prose Morgan details the evolution of the artist,

                    premier muralists. Morgan focuses upon Cox's growth as an academic painter committed to
                    mastering the fundamentals of drawing and composition and to emulating the best work of the European
                    tradition. Morgan's best writing surfaces in his descriptions of the artworks themselves,
                    many of which are not reproduced and none of which are reproduced in color. The biographer is
                    weakest in portraying personalities and relationships, and the reader sometimes wishes for a
                    leavening of anecdote to soften the relentless succession of descriptions of Cox's artistic
                    activities.</p>
            <p>Morgan's chapter on Cox's murals and the American mural painting movement is
                    perhaps the book's most important chapter. Cox's work coincided with a building
                    boom and a growing interest in public art that saw painters decorate approximately four hundred <pb n="349" id="VAA4025-091-3-111"/> buildings in the first two decades of the new century.
                    "Murals were the grand opera of painting …," writes Morgan;
                    "their themes were larger than life, grander than living," and they were meant
                    "to speak broadly to a tradition that viewers could comprehend, and which would enlarge
                    their sense of importance as citizens" (p. 139). Cox's knowledge of Italian
                    Renaissance masters, his belief in the power of idealism and allegory, and his proficiency as a
                    figure painter combined to make the artist one of America's most sought-after muralists.

                    </placeName> City.</p>
            <p>As Morgan shows, Cox's critical attack on modernism, which he saw as culturally divisive
                    with its emphasis on the eccentric, the individual, and the mundane, was a natural extension of his
                    classical training and his belief that art should unify and uplift the viewing public. Though
                    Cox's conservative stand has been largely discredited, his writings testify to the large
                    aspirations of an age that made best sellers out of such novels as Lew Wallace's <hi rend="i">Ben-Hur</hi> and Charles Major's <hi rend="i">When Knighthood Was in
                    Flower.</hi> Morgan's biography illuminates the kind of dedication and struggle that a life
                    in American art entailed, even for someone as talented as Cox, whose finances were a continual worry
                    and whose critics, including family members, were not always supportive of his belief in the
                    idealism and symbolism of nude figures. The book will be useful to anyone interested in American art
                    and culture.</p>

            <p>While John Gibbon's role as a Union officer during the Civil War was chronicled in his <hi rend="i">Personal Recollections of the Civil War</hi> (1928), his military and personal
                    experiences in the American West are less systematically delineated. This edited work presents an
                    account of Gibbon's more than two decades of military service in the American West
                    assembled from articles he published in various magazines, particularly the <hi rend="i">American
                        Catholic Quarterly Review</hi>, and from manuscript materials in the General John Gibbon

                    </placeName> Military Academy, Gibbon was a perceptive observer of the changing life of the western
                    frontier, and his works provide perspective on the transitory nature of the frontier. Although a
                    military officer throughout his career, he was, <pb n="350" id="VAA4025-091-3-112"/> nevertheless,
                    not unaware of the failure of military and civilian policy in addressing the future of Native
                    Americans.</p>
            <p>The editors have selected for inclusion in this work entries that reveal Gibbon's
                    experiences in frontier travel, his fascination with the natural wonders of Yellowstone and the
                    West, his role in the Indian campaigns of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and his
                    suggestions for addressing the "Indian Question." Each entry is a personal and
                    unofficial account of a selected segment of Gibbon's western experiences. Much of the work
                    focuses upon his military endeavors in this region including his experiences in the aftermath of the
                    Battle of the Little Bighorn, his pursuit of Chief Joseph and the Nez Percé, and the
                    defeat of his forces at the Battle of the Big Hole by the Nez Percé.</p>
            <p>Although not present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Gibbon arrived there with his company of
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mtu">Montana</region>

                    providing care for Major Marcus Reno's wounded forces and the burial of General George A.
                    Custer's men. While providing no new insight into the details of this battle, his account
                    does present a sense of the universal confusion and apprehension that swept through General Alfred
                    H. Terry's forces as they sought to comprehend what had transpired.</p>
            <p>Appreciating the nuances of frontier life in the West, Gibbon sensitively describes in clear and
                    concise prose the plight of Native Americans, the transformation of the region by white settlement,
                    and the decline of wildlife resources. Commenting frequently upon the difficulty of travel in this
                    region, Gibbon demonstrates the dilemmas of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Army in closing with the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Nez Percé, societies that were
                    more mobile and more knowledgeable of the environment in which they lived. Although a military
                    officer with a distinguished record of service, Gibbon empathized with the Indian tribes he
                    encountered and understood their reaction to continued white intrusion into their traditional lands.
                    While recognizing the inevitability of the destruction of the traditional life of the Crow, Sioux,
                    Cheyenne, and Nez Percé, he acknowledged the legitimacy of their defense of their lands
                    and the responsibility the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government had in defining a future for them.</p>
            <p>The volume is edited in a light, but careful manner. Since many of the entries were derived from
                    articles in the <hi rend="i">American Catholic Quarterly Review</hi>, it would have been useful to
                    have explored Gibbon's relationship with this publication. The book's index allows
                    the reader to find specific topics and themes easily. Maps would have enhanced the work and made it
                    easier to follow Gibbon's experiences in the West.</p>

            <p>Historians are prone to assert six impossible things before breakfast, but none, apparently, has
                    clamored for a good biography of Gerald Boileau, a now-forgotten, four-term <placeName>

                    </placeName> congressman first elected in 1930. Fortunately, James J. Lorence happened upon this La
                    Follette Republican and Progressive and resourcefully pursued his career through more than one
                    hundred manuscript collections. Boileau's congressional tenure, though bracketed by
                    unremarkable service as district attorney and then circuit court judge, placed him at the center of
                    congressional left-wing activities.</p>
            <p>As floor leader of the House's Progressive/Farmer-Labor coalition and as a key figure in its
                    broader (more than forty-member) liberal bloc, better known today through leaders Maury Maverick and
                    Tom Amlie, Boileau mobilized liberals in their battles against chain stores and holding companies;
                    for currency inflation; and in support of aid to poor farmers, unemployed and unionizing workers,
                    and Spanish loyalists. Lorence's evidence on the liberals’ effectiveness in
                    pushing President Franklin D. Roosevelt leftward is mixed—at some points he dismisses
                    their efforts as "an interesting side show" while at others he notes their
                    "substantial impact." His roll call analyses of Progressive/Farmer-Labor unity are
                    more impressive, although he might have elaborated upon the techniques and skills employed by
                    Boileau to help to secure this cohesion. Lorence is most convincing in accounting for this
                    coalition's decline; he traces its dissolution to splits between isolationists and
                    interventionists, to regional differences, and to the rout suffered in the 1938 election's
                    conservative avalanche.</p>
            <p>One fascinating puzzle, however, remains at the book's center. From the start, Lorence
                    presents Boileau as a progressive "politicians’ politician," a
                    "doer," someone whose fierce rhetorical commitment to progressive principles did
                    not get in the way of calculated political advancement. Boileau's skills as a flexible
                    insider, tactician, and coalition builder, Lorence shows, were also reflected in his success in
                    drawing support from a range of farmer, veteran, union, and constituent groups (he was a vigorous
                    defender of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> milk producers). But what Lorence does not explain fully is why, in 1937 and 1938,
                    Boileau, though apparently never a "card-carrying communist," worked closely with
                    party members. His resulting radical reputation doomed what would already have been an uphill
                    reelection battle. Boileau apparently had reveled in his newfound national prominence and his status
                    as featured speaker on the radio and at left-wing gatherings. Lorence's main explanation
                    goes beyond Boileau's commitment to "principle" to place a <pb n="352" id="VAA4025-091-3-114"/> counterintuitive emphasis on Boileau's overarching
                    "ambition," especially his hope to parlay his notoriety into a Progressive
                    senatorial nomination.</p>
            <p>Perhaps if Lorence had more systematically explored Boileau's personality (despite using
                    Boileau's private papers, this volume is definitely a "public life"), his
                    ideology (the picture of his distinctly non-"urban liberal" antitrust
                    individualism is not terribly helpful in this episode), his "fiery" rhetorical
                    style (which only in this stage of his life is depicted as shrill), and his own assessment of what
                    the Communist party had to offer, these crucial two years would have seemed less out of character.
                    Just by raising such intriguing questions through this clearly written and well-informed narrative,
                    however, Lorence has advanced the understanding of the left-wing congressional challenge to
                    Roosevelt.</p>

            <p>Harry S. Truman's historical reputation attained a kind of national apotheosis in 1992.
                    First occurred the publication of David G. McCullough's massive, adoring, and best-selling
                    biography. Then President George Bush adopted Truman's 1948 campaign as a model for his own
                    ill-fated effort to gain a second term in the White House. In the process Truman became a national
                    political saint whose allegiance to the Democratic party seemed almost irrelevant to his larger
                    status as a legendary embodiment of American outspokenness. Few in 1992 remembered what Truman stood
                    for; they recalled only that he gave political opponents hell and thereby won an upset victory over
                    Thomas E. Dewey and the over-confident Republicans.</p>
            <p>Robert H. Ferrell's excellent study now restores Truman to a human scale and weighs his
                    character and achievements with balance and insight. This biography does not treat Truman as the
                    typical American transformed into a great president in the crucible of the Cold War. For Ferrell, a
                    distinguished member of the Indiana University faculty, Truman "was not the complete
                    leader; he was capable of errors" (p. xi). The judicious tone of the book adds weight to
                    Ferrell's overall endorsement of Truman's record in public life.</p>
            <p>Another strength of Ferrell's narrative is the coverage of the significant historical
                    controversies that have surrounded Truman's life and presidency. The handling of such
                    issues as containment, the Korean War, and Truman's role in the onset of McCarthyism is
                    very well done. In the most discussed decision that Truman made, <pb n="353" id="VAA4025-091-3-115"/> to drop the atomic bomb on the Japanese in August, 1945, Ferrell sets out the difficult choices
                    that the president confronted. On the question of prospective American casualties for an invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>, Ferrell comes down on the side of a higher estimate of lives lost than do the critics
                    of Truman. The review of the evidence that Ferrell provides is thorough and convincing.</p>
            <p>Ferrell's evenhanded approach to Truman provides other illuminating insights. He suggests
                    that the president's fatigue in office caused many of the nagging problems and mistakes of
                    his second term. Truman's administrative style gets higher marks than the relaxed and often
                    careless approach of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The book also contains many tart appraisals of the
                    personalities of the Truman era. Ferrell concludes that Clark Clifford overrated his own importance
                    in the Truman White House. William O. Douglas, Ferrell says, "was an attractive
                    second-rater" (p. 271). The criticism of General Douglas MacArthur is appropriate; the
                    scenario about a potential Taft-MacArthur slate in 1952 seems implausible.</p>
            <p>The notes to the text are a small book in themselves. They will provide leads for further research
                    and offer incisive judgments about many issues relating to Truman and his times. The range of
                    sources consulted and the information assembled further reveal Ferrell's mastery of this
                    period.</p>
            <p>Truman may have been the last of the citizen presidents. He kept a firm grasp on the distinction
                    between the office he occupied and his own sense of himself. While he contributed to the growth of
                    the imperial presidency during the Cold War, Truman never forgot the human dimensions of his
                    stewardship in the White House. As the nation approaches another dreary presidential election of
                    sound bytes, focus groups, and media-driven posturing, Harry Truman's down-to-earth
                    qualities have an appealing freshness. Ferrell's fascinating biography has well captured
                    the individuality, imperfections, and sizeable achievements of the nation's thirty-third
                    president.</p>

            <p>Prior to 1963 the National Council of Churches, an umbrella organization of Protestant denominations,
                    took little direct action on racial discrimination and segregation. The council had established in
                    1921 a Department of Race Relations, later renamed the <pb n="354" id="VAA4025-091-3-116"/>
                    Department of Racial and Cultural Relations, whose major event was Race Relations Sunday. It was an
                    annual reminder of the need to dispel prejudice. In 1956 the council began its "Southern
                    Project" to mediate interracial tensions in the aftermath of the Brown v. Board of <hi rend="i">Education</hi> Supreme Court decision that prohibited separate public school systems.
                    The council's efforts, however, were still more expressive than instrumental.</p>
            <p>Drawing upon New Testament language and imagery, Findlay writes, "Between 1960 and 1963
                    there emerged a sense of the imminence of a <hi rend="i">kairos</hi> among church people, of the
                    growing need to act or to participate publicly ‘as the church’ in the great
                    racial struggles that were so deeply affecting the nation" (p. 4). That favorable moment of
                    heightened expectations and new possibilities differed from <hi rend="i">chronos</hi> or regular,
                    normal, clock time, but it was stimulated in large measure by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s
                    famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, drafted on April 16, 1963. With its scathing attack on the
                    inaction of the churches, that document put mainline religious groups on the defensive. Findlay
                    credits the black struggle for civil rights, more than the goodwill of church people, with creating
                    the <hi rend="i">kairos</hi> moment.</p>
            <p>On June 7, 1963, the General Board of the council voted to establish a Commission on Religion and
                    Race with a substantial budget. For the first time the Protestant churches, nationwide, approved
                    support of the struggle for racial justice. Three years earlier the council had elected J. Irwin
                    Miller its president. The first layman to hold that position, Miller was from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and a director in the family firm of Cummins Engine, the world's
                    largest manufacturer of diesel engines. During the 1930s he had desegregated Cummins plants in
                    Indiana. President John F. Kennedy appointed Miller chair of the national meeting of church leaders
                    held at the White House on June 17 to endorse the president's civil rights program and
                    pending legislation.</p>
            <p>One of the commission's first tasks was to rally support for the March on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in August. Some 40,000 church people participated in the march. They also lobbied for
                    passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act by persuading several key
                    midwestern legislators to vote for the legislation. About 275 ministers and lay members spent time
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> during Freedom Summer, 1964. That fall, the council organized the Delta Ministry to
                    assist the poor in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> with community development. The Delta Ministry abandoned traditional missionary
                    paternalism for a model of quiet servanthood. One of its major successes was the Child Development
                    Group of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, which sponsored Head Start programs throughout the state. Its Delta Opportunity
                    Corporation and Delta Foundation sought to promote job retraining, literacy, health education, home
                    building, and light industry. <pb n="355" id="VAA4025-091-3-117"/> The Delta Foundation started
                    eight companies to manufacture bicycle wheels, blue jeans, attic stairs, house fans, railroad
                    spikes, and electrical mechanical switches in the economically depressed region where hundreds of
                    thousands of African Americans became unemployed after the mechanization of cotton production.</p>
            <p>By the early 1970s the <hi rend="i">kairos</hi> moment of the 1960s in race relations subsided.
                    Findlay does a superb job of explaining the declining interest in racial justice. The 1960s riots,
                    the rise of black power, and the debate over fundamental social and economic change weakened the
                    earlier consensus on civil rights. The "Black Manifesto" that demanded a half
                    billion dollars in reparations from all the white churches of America met a strong rebuff. Findlay
                    correctly concludes that the council's involvement in the 1960s black freedom movement was
                    vulnerable because it was a top-down commitment by church hierarchy rather than a grass-roots
                    commitment by the church membership.</p>

                    the national consensus on racial justice that emerged after World War II but disintegrated by the
                    1970s.</p>

            <p>The subtitle of John R. Thelin's book implies that actual reform has occurred during the
                    history of college sports whereas his text proves the opposite. Throughout this century
                    intercollesate athletics have become increasingly corrupt and the people in
                    charge—coaches, athletic directors, and compliant faculty and college
                    presidents—have become less willing and able to make systemic changes as well as more
                    adept at defusing all reform attempts. Very few schools, notably the Ivy League institutions and
                    Notre Dame, have been exceptions to this rule.</p>
            <p>For readers who do not know the sorry history of the major reform movements in college sports, <hi rend="i">Games Colleges Play</hi> provides essential facts and excellent analysis. Thelin shows
                    that college sports have long been highly commercial enterprises with many attendant evils and that
                    the first major reform effort, undertaken in the 1920s by the Carnegie Foundation, produced a
                    brilliant <pb n="356" id="VAA4025-091-3-118"/> report and changed nothing because university
                    administrators were unwilling to implement its proposals on their individual campuses.</p>
            <p>By the 1930s such conferences as the Big Ten, while posing as the reformers of college sports,
                    implemented rules to insure increasing commercialization. After World War II intercollegiate
                    athletics entered a boom period that culminated in the basketball-fixing scandals of the late
                    1940s—early 1950s. From these events came the second major reform movement, led by the
                    American Council on Education's Presidential Committee. The committee suggested many wise
                    proposals, all of which were sent to oblivion by the big-time college coaches and their booster and
                    media allies.</p>
            <p>In the late 1950s and 1960s coaches became even more brazen, and Thelin notes that in the Big Ten,
                    with sports scandals occurring at many schools, including Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, there was "an unmistakable tone of levity among coaches" in their
                    reactions to conference penalties (p. 161). (Only one coach in college sports history escapes the
                    author's disdain—Knute Rockne of Notre Dame—and, inexplicably, Thelin
                    accepts as proof of Rockne's character, the film Knute Rockne—<hi rend="i">All
                        American</hi> as well as a propaganda document on the coach-as-character-builder.)</p>
            <p>Intercollegiate athletics continued to expand in the 1970s, and abuses increased to the point where,
                    in 1980, they moved, to quote the chapter title, "From Sports Page to Front Page."
                    Again reformers suggested changes—the Knight Commission offered the most thoughtful
                    ones—but the college sports establishment had long ago learned how to "cool
                    out" and "wait out" all reform attempts. Thus, in the 1990s the problems,
                    particularly financial, mount, but the basic structure of college sports—the autonomy
                    that most universities allow their athletic departments—remains immutable. The only
                    possible agent of change lies outside the university—government agencies that might make
                    various demands upon athletic departments but probably will not.</p>
            <p>Finally, Thelin's chronicle of the failures of the attempts to reform intercollegiate
                    athletics and the "games colleges play" in burying those efforts is a profoundly
                    pessimistic book. However, any fan seriously interested in the reality of college sports will
                    benefit from reading it. But be warned: Games Colleges Play will not make watching the
                    "Hurryin’ Hoosiers" or most other college teams any easier.</p>

            <p>No building type is more characteristically American than the movie theatre, and no movie theatre
                    architect is more representative than S. Charles Lee. Yet the title of this book must be taken
                    seriously, for it is not a broad survey but a history of the movie theatre examined through one
                    designer's work. Lee's theatres are located primarily in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, and Valentine places his career squarely in the context of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Los Angeles</settlement>
                    </placeName> film industry and its business culture. That Hollywood manufactured a world of its own
                    in order to market its product to the largest number of consumers possible will surprise no one. The
                    extent to which an architect such as Lee could directly express corporate Hollywood's
                    values and manipulate the movie-going public may surprise many.</p>
            <p>Valentine demonstrates that the movie palace became a national form of architecture that supported a
                    distinctly American genre of entertainment for several decades. She traces the emergence of the
                    movie house from its origins in traditional theatre design, explaining the programmatic and
                    functional circumstances that made the film theatre unique. The evolution of movie theatre design
                    was intimately related to and driven by the artistic and technical development of film as an
                    entertainment medium. She argues convincingly that movies fulfilled deep psychological needs rooted
                    in American culture during the era from World War I until the second decade after World War II and
                    that movie theatres were intentionally conceived as extensions of that psychology.</p>
            <p>The movie palaces designed by Lee, whose career unfolded simultaneously with the emergence of popular
                    film, were integral to film as a medium and addressed quintessentially the psychology of film going.
                    Influenced initially by the architecture of other forms of popular entertainment such as the
                    nickelodeon and vaudeville, the movie theatre eventually developed an evocative typological
                    character of its own, invented and refined largely in Lee's work. His theatres initially
                    succeeded in attracting patrons to film as a novelty and later celebrated the fantasy and escape of
                    film as popular entertainment. After World War II his movie theatre designs reflected changes in the
                    economics of film distribution, economics that eventually forced film presenters into competition
                    with home entertainment.</p>
            <p>Well researched and well documented, the book draws artistic, technical, functional, marketing, and
                    even legal issues of the film industry into a reliable interpretation of the architectural settings
                    in which movies were shown. Valentine is not particularly critical <pb n="358" id="VAA4025-091-3-120"/> of the commercial film industry and its architectural patronage, noting
                    fairly dispassionately the antisemitism of Hollywood that caused Lee to change his name from Levi;
                    the profit motives of both architect and patron; and the tinsel culture of Hollywood altogether. The
                    book is nonetheless well written and generously illustrated with good photographs of movie theatres
                    in their original conditions. It is particularly accessible to nonspecialists who may be interested
                    in architecture but unfamiliar with its terminology, and it includes a useful bibliography of
                    sources for related reading and study.</p>
