            <p rend="center">THE COMING OF JOHN SHRADER</p>
            <p>One hundred years ago John Shrader, the regular appointed circuit rider of the Methodist Episcopal
                    church traveling in southwestern Indiana, brought together on Saturday, December 12, 1819, at Hugh
                    McGary's double log warehouse in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where Shrader preached, three educated regularly ordained ministers, local preachers,
                    Richard and Joseph Wheeler, brothers, then living in Blue Grass, North <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh county</region>
                    </placeName>, in the British settlement, and Robert Parrett, living on a clearing in the wilderness
                    on the western border of the settlement near where Blairsville is now located in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName>. The occasion was an unusual one for the time and locality, which accounts for its
                    mention in local history.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>Organized Methodist forces, adjusted to the life and necessities of the widely scattered pioneers in
                    the wilderness, had before this date established a preaching place at McGary's ferry, and
                    the church records show the names of preachers assigned to this territory from 1809 continuously

                    </placeName> before this meeting had been assessed at 56¼ cents per quarter of three

            </p>
            <p>Trifling as the sum mentioned now seems to us, it represented $2.25 cents per year, or
                    about one thirtieth of the salary of the circuit rider, $60.00 per year, which was,
                    before <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> became a hamlet and the county seat, its proper proportion.</p>
            <p>As early as 1814 on the formation of <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Warrick county</region>,
                            <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
               </placeName> was named and existed in the
                    brain of Hugh McGary, its proprietor, as a prospective town site.</p>
            <p>It had already been, for three months, under that name, the county seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>, but was changed by the legislature and remained for three years little more than Hugh
                    McGary's residence and store and ferry over the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, as well as
                    a ferry over Pigeon creek, half a mile west, to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName>, the eastern boundary of which reached in 1815 to Pigeon creek. Hugh McGary, while not
                    a church man, was a promoter and town builder and anxious to give his prospective town prominence of
                    every character, and I have no doubt that his house or store had been a preaching point for the
                    circuit rider during all of this time, though there exists no other record in any published history
                    of any religious meetings held in <placeName>

            <p>The Wheelers and Parrett were local Wesleyan preachers, who had only just arrived in the English
                    settlement, and Shrader wisely saw the opportunity to begin a work which now<hi rend="sup">7</hi> at

            <p>The occasion which we celebrate today was a week day meeting, but under the conditions of pioneer
                    life, week day meetings were essential to religious worship, and all ordinary business was suspended
                    when they were held.</p>
            <p>Shrader first introduced Methodism into <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>,
                            <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Lebanon</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1818. Isaac Reed, the Presbyterian missionary, one of the most authentic historians
                    of early southern Indiana, was stationed as pastor of a church in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1818, and records that the Methodists already had a meeting-house. This
                    building immediately followed John Shrader's visit there earlier in that year. At the first
                    Methodist meeting held in McGary's warehouse, it was arranged that Robert Parrett and the
                    two Wheeler brothers should conduct religious services regularly at that place, each of them once
                    every six weeks, and the appointments were so arranged that there was divine service at that
                    warehouse every other Sunday, besides an occasional extra sermon by the circuit rider.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus matters continued until the spring of 1821, when the few Methodists in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> obtained permission from Dr. John W. Shaw to use the front room of his new residence,
                    then in process of erection, as a place of worship. The building was weather boarded and lathed, but
                    not plastered. This house stood on the present site of the Chandler block on First street between
                    Locust and Walnut. The Shaw residence continued to be occupied by the Methodists as their place of
                    worship until the early part of 1824, when the congregation obtained use of a large room adjoining
                    the Warner tavern, where the meetings were continued for the next three years.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    for the preacher to come around, had it vacated, swept and cleaned.</p>
            <p>In 1825, Robert Parrett moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, bought 160 acres of land on the southern boundary of the town, which is now solidly
                    built up as a part of the city, and in that year, at his house, established a church class.</p>
            <p>Some local historians–most of them state the facts as I have stated them, none controvert
                    them,–treat the establishment of a "class" in 1825 as the first
                    introduction of Methodism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and upon that idea alone have stated that the introduction of Presbyterianism was
                    earlier here, though admittedly later than December, 1819. But this claim results from want of
                    proper understanding of the machinery of the Methodist church as established by Wesley, the same in
                    1819, and substantially the same now, and in its adjustment to the backwoodsmen. "The
                    Circuit Rider, the local preacher or class leader, the classes, the love-feast or a general
                    meeting–these were enough in way of religious machinery."<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the meeting we celebrate today were present the circuit rider, three local preachers, at a general
                    public meeting, though on weekday, and a permanent organization, publicly announced that four
                    Methodist ministers would by turns furnish Sunday preaching alternately every other Sunday from that
                    time, and they did. This work was done under the direction of a circuit rider, fully authorized,
                    traveling a circuit previously established, embracing <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a preaching point some time earlier. The date of the first establishment is not
                    recorded by local historians, but they record the facts as I state them.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>The itinerant system of Methodism in full practical operation, in its introduction in the Wilderness,
                    furnished a primitive, unique and unsurpassed system, independent of the class-meeting, whereby the

                    church machinery or in the far greater part of itinerant work in the wilderness, and that the

                    regular church organization in full operation and the probabilities are that the missionary spirit
                    of these founders had this institution of Methodism in operation at the time of the organization of
                    the public Sunday services in 1819.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>After the Presbyterian church was built in 1831 these local preachers for a considerable period
                    furnished regular preaching in that church, where all denominations met together in the absence of

                    </placeName>. While he never joined the travelling ministry, he felt a call for continuous work as a
                    preacher and was probably more active as an exhorter and local preacher than any of the local
                    preachers of this section, excepting John Shrader and Moses Ashworth. For many years he was the
                    regular preacher at the Stringtown Union church, and there are persons now living who speak with
                    reverence and affection of his services to that community.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

                    1839. Upon his farm was burned the brick with which the building was constructed. Without his aid it
                    could not have been built at that time as it was. Local history has done ample justice to both
                    Joseph Wheeler and Robert Parrett, both of whom left a number of descendants of prominent families

                                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                                    </placeName>, embracing the country from the mouth of <geogName>Blue
                                    river</geogName> up to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Rev. J. Cord had been appointed to this circuit by the bishop; but his
                                    house being consumed by fire, he was compelled to quit traveling for a season, and
                                    return to his friends, I came to Cord's appointment at Gazaway's,
                                    and found him preaching from ‘The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not
                                    want.’ It was a good sermon, preached by a good man. After service I told
                                    him that I had come to take his place. He appeared glad to be released, and hastened
                                    home. I now entered on my work with much fear and trembling. Revivals had commenced
                                    at different points on the circuit under Cord's preaching, and on me rested
                                    the responsibility of carrying on this great work, which extended nearly all over
                                    the circuit; and during the year nearly six hundred were taken into the church on
                                    trial. I took into the circuit, as new preaching-places, <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Lexington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, Jeffer-sonville, and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Some seven or eight members of the church had formed themselves into a
                                    class at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and called on me to preach for them, which I did in a tavern occupied
                                    by a Mrs. Ruff. In this tavern I administered the sacrament of the Lord's
                                    supper for the first time, I suppose, that it was ever administered in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>

                        <p>At the close of this year, by the direction of the presiding elder, I went to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to meet Bishop M'Kendree, and conduct him to the seat of the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                                    </placeName> conference, which was to be held at Bethel meeting-house, near the
                                    present town of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, the county seat of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Daviess county</region>
                                    </placeName>, Indiana. I was taken sick the first day of the conference, but was
                                    well taken care of at the house of William Hawkins. My appointment for the ensuing
                                    year was <geogName>Spring River</geogName> circuit, <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                                    </placeName> territory. It was some time before I sufficiently recovered from my
                                    sickness to enable me to ride. But while yet feeble I started for my field of labor,
                                    which required <hi rend="i">a</hi> journey of five hundred miles. <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-017-1-018"/> My circuit embraced a large extent of territory; it was
                                    mountainous and rocky; the settlements were very scattering, and it was far between
                                    the appointments. The inhabitants were mostly hunters, and lived on the game they
                                    caught. They generally brought their dogs and guns to meeting with them. The dogs
                                    very often differed with each other; and a quarrel ensued, and this ended in a
                                    general dog fight. This always produced a stir in the congregation, and consumed
                                    some time before peace could be restored and ratified. The preacher would be
                                    interrupted in his sermon, or perhaps forget his text, and have to finish with an
                                    exhortation.</p>
                        <p>At other times the hunters would return home during divine service, with venison,
                                    bear meat and dogs. But we were not easily disturbed in those days. We had plenty of
                                    venison, bear-meat, and turkeys to eat; but our bread was corn, and coarse at that.
                                    In many places we had no way of grinding our grain, except on what was called
                                    Armstrong's mill. This was generally a long cedar pole, with one end made
                                    fast on the ground, and supported in the middle by two forks, with a pestle fastened
                                    to the small end. Under it we placed a mortar, and thus we prepared our breadstuff,
                                    and this we frequently baked without sifting; and perhaps this is the reason why we
                                    did not have the dyspepsia. In some parts of the circuit, however, we fared well for
                                    the times, found warm friends, and, at two or three appointments, had good revivals
                                    of religion. At the close of the year I traveled as far west as the
                                        <geogName>Arkansas river</geogName>, and attended a camp meeting on its bank. We
                                    had a good meeting, at the close of which I started for conference, which sat at
                                    M'Kendree chapel, near <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city">Cape
                                        Girardeau</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                           </placeName>.</p>
                        <p>My next appointment was Corydon, Indiana. I was much pleased with this appointment,
                                    and felt myself at home among my old friends.</p>

            <p>In 1816 the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> conference was organized, and held its first session at <geogName>Turkey

                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. The following is Father Shrader's account of the organization of the
                    conference, and of his first appointment from the conference: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Bishop M'Kendree and myself started from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                     </placeName>, for <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                            </placeName>, from whence Walker, Scripps, and others, were to travel with us through the
                            wilderness to the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                            </placeName> conference. After camping in the wilderness three nights, we arrived at the
                            seat of the conference. When the conference was organized we found that we had seven members
                            present, and some few were admitted on trial. These are now all dead, except J. Scripps and
                            myself. The conference extended over four different states. Most of the members of
                            conference were young men. We had received very little quarterage from our circuits, and
                            consequently were in tolerably straightened circumstances. Bishop M'Kendree gave
                            the conference one hundred dollars, <pb n="13" id="VAA4025-017-1-019"/> and this, added to
                            our share of the funds, made us a pretty fair dividend. From this conference we scattered
                            over this immense territory. My appointment was to <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                            </placeName> circuit, embracing the settlements between the <geogName>Missouri</geogName>
                            and <geogName>Mississippi rivers</geogName>. I commenced preaching in St. Charles in a
                            tavern. Some of the bacchanalians would leave their worship and listen to me awhile, and
                            sometimes they would swear that I was preaching the best sermon that they ever heard. We had
                            a good revival on the <placeName>

                            part of the world. Having to lodge in the woods six nights, going and returning, I was taken
                            very sick, and had like to have died in the wilderness.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                        <p>John Shrader was the preacher in charge of the Indian Creek circuit, and he had for his

                            embraced in this circuit I do not know. All my information concerning this circuit is
                            obtained from the minutes. From this source of information I learn there was a pretty good
                            increase on the circuit, for it advanced from four hundred and eighty-six to six hundred and
                            thirty-seven, being an addition of one hundred and fifty-one, which was doing pretty well in

            <p>John Shrader had all of the modesty and simplicity of a cultured mind. His daughter, Mrs. W. H. Grim

                    himself. The incidents of his life are gathered from outside sources. The records of the conferences
                    in which he worked as a travelling minister show successful revivals and increase wherever he went.
                    The historians of early Methodism in Indiana rely upon his statements written at their request for
                    the earliest authentic historical statements of the work in which he was engaged.</p>
            <p>That he was a man of ability and culture for the time, and regarded as fit to lead in the work of the
                    introduction of Methodism into the territory and state of Indiana, is evidenced by the fact that he
                    was twice sent to Corydon, which was the capital of Indiana territory and state.</p>

            <p>An incident is given by the daughter of John Shrader upon the authority of an eye-witness, Mrs. Ann
                    Dooks, which occurred at a camp meeting near <placeName>

               </placeName>, where he was
                    actively at work as a local preacher. At the close of the services when the lights on the ground had
                    been put out, about 1:00 o'clock in the morning, a band of drunken rowdies entered the
                    meeting ground and created a disturbance. When urged to be quiet and retire they said that if they
                    could have their preacher preach a sermon they would be quiet. Upon being asked who their preacher
                    was they said Father Shrader. He was aroused from his bed, dressed, took the platform, the grounds
                    were lit up and he opened the services with a song. Those who knew him well describe his voice as
                    one of great musical power. He took for his text the subject "What will a man give in
                    exchange for his soul." At the end of the sermon, seekers were invited to come forward. A
                    number did so, and four of those rowdies, who by this time had become thoroughly sobered, professed
                    religion at this meeting, and later became Methodist preachers.</p>

            <p>The work of John Shrader, as a travelling preacher in the itinerancy continued for only about eight
                    years. He married in 1821, located and settled near Poseyville in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName>, upon a quarter section of land given to his wife by her father, Jonathan Jaquess, who
                    in 1815, when he came to Indiana territory, entered nine or more quarter sections of fine land, one
                    for each of his children. Shrader's lifework– as in a measure did Moses Ashworth
                    and Joseph Wheeler's– continued without interruption though as a local preacher
                    in active work in the ministry for which he seemed so fitted and in which he was so successful.</p>

            <p>Moses Ashworth preceded Shrader in time as an active preacher and travelled the first circuit located
                    wholly north of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The first entire circuit in the territory of Indiana was the Silver Creek, which was organized in
                    1807 with Moses Ashworth as the circuit preacher. This new circuit took in Clark's grant,
                    which had formerly been included within the <geogName>Salt River</geogName> and
                    <geogName>Shelby</geogName> circuit of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> district. With the organization of this circuit, Indiana Methodism starts on its
                    separate career. Moses Ashworth closed his first year with a campmeeting, held in the
                    Robertson's neighborhood, a few miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>

            <p>From the rule more or less strictly in force at that early time, which practically operated to locate

                    that his marriage was not later than a couple of years from that date. The record of his activity

                            Armstrong preached on Saturday at eleven a. m., and George Randall preached at night. On

                            impression which it made upon the minds of his hearers, may be traced the crowded assemblies
                            and fixed attention which he received during his stay with us. At the conclusion of the
                            sermon a liberal collection was taken up, to assist in liquidating the debts hanging over

                        <p>Our house is one of the best and neatest churches I have seen in any part of the state. It is
                            sixty feet by forty, with a basement, which is to be divided into smaller rooms. Its cost
                            was between five and six thousand dollars. This amount of money has been so expended as to
                            avoid the appearance of extravagance on the one hand, and meanness on the other. Some
                            attention has been paid to its external appearance, so that it stands an ornament to the
                            town. Care has been taken that its internal arrangements should be neat and comfortable. The
                            pulpit, altar, and aisles are all neatly carpeted. Thus erected, furnished, and arranged, it
                            was dedicated to God; and it was soon evident that He accepted the offering at the hands of
                            His people; for He came down in the midst in great power; and filled the house with His
                            glory. Such was the interest evinced in the subject of religion, that our meeting was
                            protracted nine days. Brother Maffitt, notwithstanding his feeble health, labored with us
                            night and day, with great success; our altar being continually crowded by such as were
                            inquiring what they should do to be saved; most of whom, <list type="footnotes">

                                    of that church. But why should I? Only one man, so far as I know, yet lives who was
                                    a member in October, 1848, when I became pastor of the only Methodist Episcopal
                                    church in the then little city, and it was not a charge to be much desired at that.
                                    There were less than two hundred members, and some of these lived three miles in the
                                    country. The church was large enough for the congregation; but it was dingy inside
                                    and out, and approached from the street by uncovered wooden steps, too rickety to be
                                    safe; and it was in cumbered by a debt of $75 for wood and oil and
                                    janitor's services, which could not be repudiated, as I learned at the
                                    first official meeting, and an unpaid balance of more than $100 to my
                                    immediate predecessor, Rev. William V. Daniel, which no one thought of paying. He

                                    But this was not all clone at once. It took six months or more, and when conference
                                    came the entire "allowance" had been paid, with a surplus of
                                    $75 in what was known as the "Blackbag collection,"
                                    which was donated to me as a compliment for having taught them how to raise the
                                    money–the largest salary they had ever paid, and the first time they had
                                    ever paid up in full; and I have been informed that they never since have failed to
                                    pay in full all claims.</p>
                        <p>As all other departments of the work–Sunday school, prayer meetings,
                                    congregations, and accessions–were about in the same proportion, I may be
                                    permitted to tell the secret of my success in each and all. I had not gone far in my
                                    reconnoissance before I discovered the need of an assistant pastor. I visited from
                                    house to house, but I could not visit every family every week. I found in the entire
                                    charge only five <hi rend="i">Western Christian Advocates.</hi> One of them came to
                                    me, one to the presiding elder, one to a local preacher, and two to two of the
                                    stewards. I began at once to put a copy of the paper in every family. I knew it
                                    would require work, but that was what I was there for, but before the ensuing May I
                                    had succeeded, except in two families. One of these preferred the <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                                    </placeName>
                                    <hi rend="i">Advocate,</hi> and one the <hi rend="i">Zion's Herald,</hi>
                                    and I allowed them their choice. In doing this, in several cases I got two, and in
                                    one case three, poor families to join, and in two or three cases of widows with
                                    large families I got small contributions from some brethren, who began to love to
                                    give since they had found they could. And now, in the quiet evening of life, there
                                    is no part of the work of my manhood's prime that seems to have yielded
                                    such returns as the days and hours that I devoted to persuading men and women to
                                    take good papers, and buy and read good books. In some cases it took much
                                    persuading. For more than a quarter of a century it was common for Judge Iglehart
                                    and others to refer to my two years' pastorate in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> as the turning-point in Methodism in that city. The good reading that I
                                    put in the hands of young and old was the principal instrument in that result.</p>
                        <p>It is dangerous to start an old man on reminiscenting; he never knows when to stop.
                                    These recollections of the long ago call to mind the kind of singing we had then. We
                                    lined the hymns, of course, and then anybody "pitched the tune"
                                    that could. There were three who took it in turn about; that is, if they could get a
                                    chance. Each in his haste to get in his work ahead of the others would sometimes
                                    pitch too high or too low, or try to make a long-meter tune fit a <pb n="23" id="VAA4025-017-1-029"/> common-meter hymn. About this time Asa Iglehart, a
                                    young lawyer who knew how to sing, moved into our city. Our method grieved him much,
                                    and he proposed that I give him the hymns in advance, and invite all who could sing
                                    to meet Saturday nights at his house and rehearse. To have proposed a choir would
                                    have smashed things. After the first announcement, I added: "Now, if you
                                    don't go and learn how to sing, I will lead the singing myself."
                                    John Ingle came to me after the benediction and said with emphasis:
                                    "They'll go. If anything on earth would induce them, that threat
                                    to lead the singing yourself will do it." They went, and that is the
                                    genesis of the unsurpassed chorus choir for which the church was afterwards famous.
                                    How it is now I do not know; but I shall know hereafter if they will let me know
                                    when they hold their next old people's meeting.</p>

            <p>About the year 1851, through the aid of Locust Street as the mother church, a new church was built on
                    Ingle street, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Later under another name, now known as Central M. E. church, a large building was
                    built on Mary and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> streets by the same congregation and is a flourishing church.</p>
            <p>In 1861, under the pastorate of Dr. S. T. Gillett, a great revival of religion occurred in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Locust Street church, and at this time the lot was purchased upon which, in 1867,
                    was completed and dedicated a large church building at a cost of $85,000, and the
                    trustees and membership of Locust Street church changed the name of their corporation and church to
                    Trinity and moved into the new building now recognized as the mother church of Methodism in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which traces its beginning a century ago to the meeting at Hugh McGary's
                    double log warehouse, which we celebrate today.</p>
            <p>In tracing the direct influence of John Shrader upon the life of the people of this part of Indiana,
                    it may be said that Trinity church is probably now the greatest single religious and moral force in
                    Methodism in southwestern Indiana and that it is one of the greatest moral and religious forces of
                    all denominations in southern Indiana.</p>
            <p>Trinity M. E. church, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, has about 1,000 members. Central M. E. church has about 700 members, with the largest
                    Sunday school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and southern Indiana, including a membership of about 1,500 with an average attendance
                    of 750 or greater. Bayard Park M. E. church absorbed <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-017-1-030"/> a small
                    church called Kingsley church, to which was taken about 100 members from Trinity church, and a large
                    church building with a parsonage was built in the residence portion of the city, and is now one of
                    the leading churches of the city and has a membership of about 600. The organization and building of
                    this church was under the direction of Trinity church.</p>
            <p>Simpson developed from a mission on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> street, and is now a vigorous church on the west side, with a membership of about 800
                    members.</p>
            <p>Wesley, originally a mission from Trinity church, is a flourishing church with about 400 members.
                    Howell M. E. church, originally a mission of Trinity church, is a flourishing church with about 350
                    members. This church is now planning to build.</p>
            <p>St. James has a membership of about 110 members.</p>
            <p>Fifth Avenue has a membership of about 90 members. All of these churches, except Fifth Avenue, own
                    parsonages.</p>
            <p>There are in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> approximately 4,000 members of the Methodist church, with a constituency of about
                    10,000 people, including members. The membership of the Methodist churches in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> district of the Indiana conference, which embraces the counties in the first
                    congressional district of Indiana, is 14,000, with a constituency estimated at not less than 35,000
                    people.</p>
            <p>When Trinity succeeded Locust Street church in 1867, after several years in building, it became the
                    central force among Methodist churches in southwestern Indiana. Among its leaders, without whom it
                    could not have been built, or maintained, as it was, were a number of members of four families of
                    pioneer origin, whose history is a part of the growth of Methodism in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Vanderburgh</region>, <region type="county">Posey</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick counties</region>
                    </placeName>, and who were likewise commonwealth builders of Indiana, worthy of more extended
                    mention than I am able to give them.</p>
            <p>At that time, and continuously since then, from one-fourth to one-third of the official board of that
                    church, composing all its various officers, have been members of these families, Jaquess, Wheeler,
                    Ingle and Iglehart. The pastor in charge during the laborious work of building Trinity church,
                    Albion <pb n="25" id="VAA4025-017-1-031"/> Fellows, who gave his life to the work, was by marriage a
                    member of one of them. One of them, of the second generation of native ministers in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Ferdinand C. Iglehart, filled a full term as pastor of the church. More than half of
                    the entire period mentioned these families have furnished the superintendent of the Sunday school.</p>

                    building and sustaining the church, the latter for many years superintendent of the Sunday school.
                    The following sketch of this family is furnished by Mr. George J. Waters of Poseyville.</p>
            <p>Prominent in early Methodism in southern Indiana, was Jonathan J. Jaquess who came to Indiana from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1815. He was born in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> in 1753 and served in the American Revolution under Colonel Sheldon, commander of the
                    7th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> regiment, afterwards known as the Light Horse brigade. He moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> settling near Cyn-thiana, and in September, 1815, with his family, consisting of
                    himself and wife and nine children, viz: Garreston, George, John Wesley, Ogden, Fletcher, Asbury,
                    Elizabeth, Permelia and Rebecca, together with other relatives, came to Indiana and settled in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey county</region>
                    </placeName> near what is now the town of Poseyville where he acquired a large body of land. That he
                    was a man of deep religious conviction is very evident from the names he gave his children, most of
                    them being named for prominent churchmen or Bible characters. He was originally a member of the
                    Episcopal church and it is related of him that upon taking leave of his old home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> he called upon his rector and, stating to him the fact that there was no church of his
                    own denomination where he was going, asked that he suggest a church with which he might unite. His
                    rector told him that there were no better people than the Methodists and suggested that he unite
                    with that church.</p>
            <pb n="26" id="VAA4025-017-1-032"/>
            <p>It was not long after this little colony reached Indiana that a church society was formed, for John
                    Shrader, in a letter written February 24th, 1876, says:</p>

                    early records of the church at Poseyville disclose the fact that some were officially connected

                  <settlement type="city">Somersham</settlement>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>, but reared in the wilderness. His education in the schools was
                    limited, but his natural ability, high ideals, and the training in the life of a pioneer developed
                    so many qualities of leadership as to make a remarkable history, and his active life is bound up in
                    the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and had already had one year in a "dame" school, and his father took
                    a standard English newspaper as long as he lived, and when Ingle came to manhood, after learning the
                    cabinet-maker's trade in Stringtown and travelling through the states along the river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he sailed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he studied law at night and earned his living by work during the day.</p>
            <p>He had, therefore, the view of the old world civilization, as well as of the Atlantic coast states,
                    when he returned in 1838 to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He then began law practice with James Lockhart, one of the strong characters of the
                    time, and after remaining with him a year, became a partner of Judge Bat-tell, one of the prominent
                    citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the beginning. With Judge Battell, his partner, and later alone in the practice,
                    he became one of the leaders of the <placeName>

                    counties in the circuit, and he had a large and valuable practice. He held for a time the office of
                    prosecuting attorney. After Judge Battell retired in 1846, Horatio Q. Wheeler was admitted to Mr.
                    Ingle's office as a student or young lawyer. A year later Wheeler became his partner, and
                    in 1849 Asa Iglehart entered the firm then known as Ingle, Wheeler and Iglehart.</p>

                    and was chosen by the directors to that office, but it is said by one of the historians that Ingle
                    rescued the railroad enterprise, which was struggling when the city was poor, and when the men who
                    had undertaken its beginning were exhausted and powerless, and that by his energy, persistence and
                    fidelity he completed the railroad and managed its affairs with superior skill during his executive
                    control; that the railroad enjoyed immunity from accident, as no other railroad in the country; and
                    that he ran no trains on Sunday upon religious and conscientious grounds.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>John Ingle was the first secretary and the superintendent of the railroad, and had charge of the

                    purchased the lease and invested his own money in promoting the mining of coal, and under the

                    the mine successfully. After the death of John Ingle, Jr., his children, in the name of John Ingle

                    originally acquired by him, so that his descendants received directly the benefit of his foresight

                    where he lived the true life of the backwoods pioneer farmer. This location was about eight miles
                    from Boonville and a little over twenty miles from the Lincoln farm, which was situated about a mile

                    which to answer Mr. Jerome. This was given him, when he quoted Lincoln's words directly
                    contradictory to those claimed by the liquor interests, and denounced the methods of those interests
                    with all his energy and power. There were a large number of temperance people in the hall and it is
                    needless to add that this short address took the audience by storm. Standing in the rear of the
                    hall, the leaders of the Anti-Saloon league witnessed this incident, and then declared that this
                    speaker ought to devote his life to the work. Soon afterward he accepted the position upon terms

                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was Elisha Embree. Mr. Embree was born in <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Lincoln
                            county</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, September 28,
                    1801. He was the son of Joshua and Elizabeth Embree. The family moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1811, and settled on land near the present site of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His father died in 1813, leaving his widow and five children in straitened
                    circumstances.</p>
            <p>The subject of this sketch did not attend school at all until he was seventeen or eighteen years old,
                    and there is a tradition that at one time he was in a class with a girl of six or seven, and it was
                    a struggle between them as to which should keep ahead. He was entirely self-educated. He read law in
                    the office of Judge Samuel Hall, and was admitted to the bar in 1825. In 1833 he was elected to the
                    state senate, and during his service in that body he stood almost alone in opposition to the wild
                    internal improvement schemes of that period, which so nearly bankrupted the state. He became judge
                    of the Fourth judicial circuit in 1835, as the successor of Judge Hall, who had resigned. He was
                    reelected to the full term in 1838. He served ten years in all. In 1847 he was elected to congress,
                    defeating Robert Dale Owen. He was the only whig ever elected from the district. During his service
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> he became acquainted with Abraham Lincoln, and lived in the same house with him. The
                    friendship formed at that time continued until the death of Judge Embree. The family have now
                    letters written to the Judge by Lincoln.</p>
            <p>Judge Embree was a strong union man. He gave three sons, all he had, to the Union army, and went
                    frequently to the front, devoting his time and energies to the service of the sick and wounded.
                    Exposures in this service are thought to have caused his death, which occurred on the 28th day of
                    February, 1863. Judge Embree became a member of the Methodist Episcopal church at an early day, and
                    took a very active part in support of the organization. For many years he was the superintendent of
                    the Sunday school, and on the occasion of his funeral the entire body of children marched <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-017-1-055"/> in the procession and cast flowers into his grave. A sketch of the life
                    of Judge Embree, prepared by the Rev. T. H. Willis, and published in the <hi rend="i">History of <placeName>

                        <p>The first Methodist Episcopal church was built in <placeName>

                            </placeName> about 1838. One of the active members in raising subscriptions to build it was
                            Judge Elisha Embree. He said, "They have been driven from private dwellings, and
                            from the jail, and from the courthouse," and he proposed now that they build a
                            house of their own. The judge was raised under the influence of
                            "Universalism." After his conversion, he examined carefully the various
                            churches, their creeds, confessions of faith, polity, etc., and came to the conclusion that
                            the Methodist Episcopal church came the nearest to his idea of a Bible church, and
                            prophesied that it would become the church, for the conversion of the world. He accordingly
                            united with it, remaining a most earnest and efficient worker until his death.</p>

            <p>Perhaps no country ever held forth greater allurement to savage huntsmen than the old territory of
                    the northwest. Its rivers and lakes teemed with edible fish; its great forests abounded with deer,
                    elk, bears and raccoons; its vast plains and prairies were filled with herds of buffalo that existed
                    up almost to the close of the eighteenth century; every swamp and morass was filled with countless
                    thousands of geese, ducks, swan and cranes, and rodents like the beaver and other animals furnished
                    the red man with the warmest of raiment in the coldest winter. To give an idea of the vast wealth of
                    this domain in fur-bearing animals alone, it may be taken into account that in the year 1818 the
                    American Fur Company, under the control of John Jacob Astor, with its headquarters at Mackinaw, had
                    in its employ about four hundred clerks and traders, together with about two thousand
                    French-Canadian voyageurs, who roamed all the rivers and lakes of the Indian country from the
                    British dominions on the north, to as far west as the <geogName>Missouri river</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The "outfits" of this company had trading posts on the <placeName>

                    The prevalence of such a depth of snow for such an extended time would certainly lead to the
                    starvation of thousands of these animals. William T. Hornaday, of the Smithsonian Institution, says:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When the snowfall was unusually heavy, and lay for a long time on the ground, the buffalo was
                            forced to fast for days together, and sometimes even weeks. If a warm day came, and thawed
                            the upper surface of the snow, sufficiently for succeeding cold to freeze it into a crust,
                            the outlook for the bison began to be serious. A man can travel over a crust through which
                            the hoofs of a ponderous bison cut like chisels and leave him floundering belly-deep. It was
                            at such times that the Indians hunted him on snow-shoes, and drove their spears into his
                            vitals as he wallowed helplessly in the drifts. Then the wolves grew fat upon the victims

                    </placeName> may more reasonably be ascribed to a combination of causes. First, the careless
                    slaughter of thousands of them by the Potawatomi, Kickapoos and Sacs and Foxes, for their hides
                    alone, in order to procure whiskey from the reckless French fur traders. Second, the useless
                    slaughter of other thousands of them under the excitement of the chase, regardless of any idea of
                    conserving the herds. Third, the slaughter of great numbers by ever increasing bands of white
                    hunters. If after the herds had been thus depleted by years of reckless killing, the great snow came
                    that covered the prairies with a solid crust for long weeks and months, and during this time other
                    thousands fell victims to starvation, wolves, and Indians upon snow-shoes, the remnants of the herds
                    that remained in the spring may well have fled beyond the <placeName>

            <p>However that may be, the opening of the nineteenth century saw the buffalo practically extinguished
                    in the territory of the northwest. A few scattered animals may have remained here and there upon the

                    Potawatomi, and that thej! went there to hunt buffaloes. The truth of this statement was denied by
                    Governor Harrison, who said that not an animal of that kind "had been seen within that

            <p>The geographical features of the northwest were such that all points in the interior were easily

                    lakes were connected by short portages, so that the Indian trapper or hunter could carry his canoe
                    for a few miles and pass from the waters that led to <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> or

                    was, that the power that commanded the lakes and water courses of the northwest, commanded at the

            <p>As to wild game, the whole valley was abundantly supplied. In the spring time, great numbers of wild

            <p>The bottom lands of this river were noted for their fertility. The annual inundations always left a

                    </placeName> in 1765, when Croghan passed through there. Wild hemp was abundant on the lowlands. The
                    delicious pecan flourished, and walnuts, hazelnuts and hickorynuts were found in great plenty. The
                    sugar maple existed everywhere, and the Indians, who were the original maple sugar makers, of the
                    world, made large quantities of this toothsome article. In addition to this the whole valley was
                    filled with wild fruits and berries, such as blackberries, dewberries, raspberries, gooseberries,
                    and the luscious wild strawberry, that grew everywhere in the open spaces and far out on the

                    by Mr. Gist in 1751, and described by him as "a very superior people", and in the
                    days of Anthony Wayne numbered among the leaders of the northwestern confederacy, were reduced and
                    decimated to scattered bands, that were daily yielding their grounds to more powerful tribes.</p>
            <p>What was the cause of this sudden and terrible degeneration of the Indian tribes at the opening of
                    the nineteenth century? It was plainly their contact with the Indian traders, the worst and most
                    vicious element of the early frontier, and described by Harrison as being "the greatest
                    villains in the world."<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Long intercourse with these unscrupulous men,
                    under the French, English and Americans, had finally accomplished a deterioration of the race. These
                    traders had pandered to every vice and bowed to every passion of their savage victims, and all from
                    the sordid motive of gain. The richest peltries were bartered for whiskey; the plains and rivers
                    were robbed of their fur-bearing and food-producing animals. In 1801 the spectacle was appalling! It
                    was believed that at that time not more than six hundred warriors were left upon the <placeName>

                    made by the Indians of the scarcity of game. It is true that the great herds of buffalo had
                    disappeared, and fearful havoc had been wrought among the swarms of beaver and otter, but if the
                    tribes had not been weakened and diseased by the constant use of liquor, much of their misery might
                    have been averted, and the natural bounties of their habitations would have still yielded them an
                    abundant supply of food. As it was, great portions of the race were enervated, and became more and
                    more dependent as their vices progressed. And along with this inordinate use of liquors, other
                    perils had come. Hecklewelder noticed among the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Delawares, a terrible increase in pulmonary diseases, as a result of the use of
                    spirituous liquors. "Our vices have destroyed them more than our swords."<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Ardent spirits in turn propagated certain blood diseases; the currents of the
                    race became corrupted, and great numbers perished.<hi rend="sup">61</hi>

            <p>Let it not be understood, however, that the glory and courage of all the tribesmen had entirely
                    departed. Far from it. Despite the depravity spread by the traders, the innate ferocity of these
                    wild men, their discipline in battle, and their knowledge of woodcraft, still made them a formidable
                    foe. Given the right leaders, who could powerfully appeal to their superstitions and their ancient
                    hatred of the paleface, and they still possessed enough of potency to resist strong armies, and to
                    strike terror to the hearts of the rugged frontiersmen.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, was Tunis Quick. He was born March 13, 1797, near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Martinsburg</settlement>, <region type="county">Berkeley county</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName> (now <placeName>
                        <region type="state">West Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>). He came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName> (or what was afterwards this county), in the autumn of 1819. He entered 160 acres of
                    land for himself and his father, in the Haw Patch, seven miles north of the present city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he afterwards helped to build one of the first houses.</p>
            <p>With him came Isaac Pancake, a young man near his own age, and also a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, who entered a nearby tract of land. Their nearest neighbors were Joseph Cox and
                    family, living about three miles to the southeast, who arrived there in April of the same year,
                    1819.</p>
            <p>The young pioneers each built on his land a small cabin, just large enough to stand up or lie down in
                    comfortably, with a small fireplace in one end. Here they prepared their food, which consisted of a
                    little corn bread, and an abundance and variety of wild meat, which they secured with their rifles
                    from the thick woods which surrounded them. The water for all necessary purposes was carried from
                    Flat Rock, about half a mile west of them.</p>
            <p>Plenty of hard work was to be done and they did it bravely and cheerfully, looking ahead to the homes
                    that were to be theirs in the future. At night their rest was sweet and safe, as there were only a
                    few Indians passing through the country then, and they were friendly.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1820, Tunis Quick's father and the other members of his family came from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they had spent the winter. A larger house was built on the east eighty of the
                    land which had been entered, and the family began pioneer life in earnest.</p>
            <p>Quite a number of settlers came on that spring, and the country began to fill up with neighbors in
                    all directions. These pioneers were hardy, honest, industrious and friendly –usually
                    regarding each other's rights to the letter. All had <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-017-1-076"/>
                    guns of some kind, and ammunition for all necessary purposes. They even formed a company for
                    training militia, and Tunis Quick was chosen captain of the company. From that time onward he
                    occupied prominent positions. Though he was only about medium size, he possessed unusual physical
                    strength and mental vigor, and his neighbors gladly recognized his leadership.</p>
            <p>Corn huskings and log rollings were almost the only festivities in which the early settlers indulged,
                    and at such gatherings whiskey flowed more or less freely. There were few teetotalers among the
                    early settlers, but not many of them drank to excess. They had already made so many sacrifices, and
                    were so filled with the desire to secure comfortable homes for themselves and their posterity, that
                    they did not allow themselves undue indulgences.</p>
            <p>Government land had been promised to the settlers at $1.25 per acre. Hard work was a
                    necessity for the pioneers, and money was scarce, but they managed to save enough to pay that price
                    for their land, and a company of them went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the land sale in 1820. Here they encountered land sharks, who, even in that early
                    day, were plying their nefarious business–trying to defraud honest, industrious people of
                    their "inalienable rights." But the early American citizens, among a great many
                    other sterling qualities, inherited independence from their forefathers; so after watching the
                    performance of the land sharks, who were running the land up to $1.50 per acre, they
                    decided to hold the government to its promise of $1.25 an acre for those who had built
                    upon their land, and begun to improve it. Accordingly, they presented a solid front with their
                    rifles, demanded their rights and were granted them without further parley.</p>
            <p>In those early days, hospitality was spontaneous and sincere. Travelers were heartily welcomed with
                    the hope that they might become neighbors in the near future. A young man named Joseph Van Meter
                    came on horseback from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and stayed over night with Tunis Quick, who had relatives in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> named Van Meter. Being distantly related to the same family, and having many ideas in
                    common, the young men both enjoyed the visit. When Mr. Van Meter, who wished to see more of the
                    country before settling down, <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-017-1-077"/> was about to start on his way the
                    next morning, he deposited $600 in gold with his new friend for safe-keeping until his
                    return. Being attacked by some kind of fever while he was gone, it was many weeks before he was able
                    to come back. No word came from him in the meantime, but when he was able to ride he returned and
                    found his money safe with his friend. They trusted each other absolutely in the beginning and were
                    the best of friends while they both lived.</p>
            <p>Joseph Van Meter went back to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but so attractive was the new country, that he and his brother-in-law, William Jones,
                    soon decided to make their future homes in Indiana. In 1821, while on their way to hunt a location
                    there, they met an acquaintance at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who was returning from the Reserve, as it was often called. He was seated on a
                    wagon-tongue and shaking violently with the ague. Between his chattering teeth he said to William
                    Jones: "Bill, turn around and go back. Go back to old Kaintuck. The darned ager will shake
                    you to pieces up thar in Indiany." But possessed of the invincible pioneer spirit, instead
                    of turning back they went forward. They were much pleased with the new country and bought farms
                    adjoining each other in the rich bottom land on the west side of Flat Rock, and almost opposite
                    Tunis Quick's farm, which was on the east side of the river. They built their homes about a
                    half mile from Flat Rock, and both became prominent citizens. The Van Meter family have all passed
                    to their reward, and John L. Jones, a prominent farmer of the county, is the only remaining member
                    of that Jones family. He still owns the farm which was selected by his father when he arrived here
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in 1821.</p>
            <p>Quite a settlement now began on the west side of Flat Rock. A large family named Records, moved from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and settled one mile and a half east of the present site of Taylorsville. In this
                    family, Tunis Quick, who was now nearly 25 years old, found a sweet, blue-eyed, sunny-haired girl of
                    17, who soon became the choice of his heart. Her name was Susanna Records. She was attractive in
                    person, more so in character, and their marriage, which occurred in September, 1822, was a happy
                    one.</p>
            <p>By that time the house had been enlarged and improved, and the young couple were quite comfortably
                    situated for <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-017-1-078"/> pioneers. Some glass window lights, which were a
                    novelty in the neighborhood, had been put in, instead of the greased paper, through which the light
                    came but dimly in those early homes. A board floor was also laid instead of the dirt floor which was
                    common at that time. Pieces of wood were inserted between the logs of the houses, extending far
                    enough into the room for the width of a bed or table and on these were laid boards to be used for
                    such furniture. Rustic benches and stools, made from forest timber, served for seats at first, but
                    it was not long until chairs and other furniture of various kinds were made in the neighborhood. The
                    first chair owned by Tunis Quick, and the only one in his home when he was married, was made by
                    Mignon Boaz, a Baptist preacher, who lived near, on the bluff bank of Flat Rock.</p>
            <p>The pioneers were not dependent upon material things for happiness. Their lives were full of heroic
                    purpose, and the pioneer women were helpmates for their husbands in the truest sense. They spun and
                    wove flax, cotton and wool into cloth for table and bed linen, and to make garments for their
                    rapidly increasing families. Some of them were very expert in dying wool and cotton, in fast and
                    beautiful colors. Also in weaving different patterns for table-cloths and counterpanes. Such energy
                    and industry as was shown by both sexes, was not without reward, and soon "the wilderness
                    blossomed as the rose."</p>
            <p>The march of progress was rapid with the passing of the years. Orchards were planted, crops of many
                    kinds were raised, and neighbors vied with each other in a good-natured way in making improvements.
                    Fever and ague were prevalent, and sometimes an epidemic of flux, or some other dreadful disease,
                    carried off their little ones, and some grown people, so that they had their full share of sorrow as
                    well as joy.</p>
            <p>As early as 1821, the Flat Rock Baptist church was organized, and not long afterwards a log house of
                    worship was built on the bluff bank of Flat Rock. Near the church, a little cemetery was begun, and
                    less than a mile away, there was soon another burying place for the beloved ones who were passing
                    away.</p>
            <p>Pioneer preachers proclaimed the gospel, sometimes with <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-017-1-079"/> much
                    performance of physical power and salutary spiritual effect. A Bible and hymn book could be found in
                    nearly every home, though other books were very scarce, and novel reading was considered quite
                    disreputable, for, to the pioneers, life was indeed real and earnest.</p>
            <p>Schools were taught by men who came from the indefinite east for that purpose, for no woman would
                    have been considered able to control a school. There was discipline in the schools and also in the
                    homes of those days–sometimes too severe; but better perhaps for the formation of
                    character than the laxity of government which prevails at present.</p>
            <p>As the years passed by and families grew larger, additions were built to the houses, more of the
                    comforts of life were enjoyed, and the duties and responsibilities of citizenship were also
                    increased and recognized.</p>
            <p>
               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the seat of justice, and justice was sometimes administered in very peculiar ways
                    by officers there; and in various parts of the country.</p>
            <p>Jack Jones, who kept a tavern, called "The Jones House", on the southwest corner of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Second streets, was elected justice of the peace. A fight was going on at a furious
                    rate in front of the tavern when Tunis Quick arrived on horseback. He greeted Mr. Jones by saying:
                    "Jack, I thought you were elected to command the peace." "And I
                    will", thundered Mr. Jones, as he rushed out to the woodpile, and seized a large limb which
                    had been cut from a tree. Pushing his way through the crowd which had gathered, he ran in between
                    the combatants and shouted in stentorian tones: "I command the peace", and peace
                    was immediately restored.</p>
            <p>A similar case occurred in Flatrock township when Tunis Quick was justice of the peace. A man who
                    lived nearly a half mile away, was in the habit of coming home drunk and whipping his wife. Tunis
                    Quick, who had remonstrated with him in vain, finally told him that people were too much disgusted
                    with his way of doing to allow it much longer, and that if he did not put a stop to it, somebody
                    else would be treating him just like he treated his wife.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards, in the dusk of a drizzly day, just as the evening "chores"
                    were all done, the abused wife was heard <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-017-1-080"/> screaming at the top of
                    her voice. Tunis Quick turned his coat wrong side out, drew an old broad-rimmed hat well down over
                    his face, and proceeded to administer justice in a most emphatic way, by giving the man a
                    well-deserved whipping. The wife interfered at last, and was in the act of pulling the hat off the
                    head of her deliverer, who immediately started away, in a different direction from his home, adding
                    as he went that next time he would give the culprit more of the same kind. The next morning the man
                    came down "to swear out a writ before the squire", but as he was unable to tell
                    who "assaulted and battered" him, the case was dismissed.</p>
            <p>In those days, letters were like angels' visit–few and far between, and highly
                    prized. They were written on large sheets of paper, one page of which was left blank. The letter was
                    then carefully folded, with the blank side out, properly addressed, and sealed with a wafer, but was
                    sent without postage. No letters could be delivered, however, until 25 cents postage was paid by the
                    would-be recipient.</p>
            <p>One day in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> postoffice, Tunis Quick saw two sisters crying. They had recently been married in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and had come with their husbands to settle in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>. When asked the cause of their distress, they replied that a letter was there from
                    their old home, and they had no money to pay the postage. It was only a neighborly kindness for one
                    who had 25 cents to pay the postage and deliver the letter. Tears were dried, earnest thanks were
                    expressed, and though the money was soon repaid, sincere gratitude found expression, through
                    different members of these families, for more than one generation.</p>
            <p>Before any railroads were built through the country, the pioneers hauled the products of their farms
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and brought home necessary commodities of different kinds. Quite a number of men
                    usually went together, with wagons and four-horse teams. They camped over night by the way,
                    sometimes sleeping in their wagons, and sometimes on blankets, spread on the ground, under the
                    trees. The journey was long and tedious, but there were compensations. Some of the men had a fine
                    sense of humor, <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-017-1-081"/> and a good relish for jokes; so the time
                    generally passed very pleasantly.</p>
            <p>It was "the rule of the road" that empty wagons should always "turn
                    out" for loaded ones; but a man whom they sometimes met, boasted that he never had
                    "turned out" for anyone, and that he never would "turn out". As
                    the party of men around the campfire one night, were talking about the surly one they expected to
                    meet the next day, Tunis Quick said, "He will turn out for me,
                    tomorrow"–and he did. Soon after the party of men started on their journey the
                    next day, they saw the churlish one approaching with his empty wagon in the middle of the road. As
                    soon as he was near enough, Tunis Quick fixed his eyes upon him, and called to him that if he did
                    not "turn out" of the road, he might expect just such treatment as was given to a
                    man the day before. When the loaded wagon came alongside the empty one, the man said: "How
                    did you treat that man yesterday?" "I turned out, myself", was the reply
                    amidst hearty cheers from the rest of the party.</p>
            <p>The roads at that time were bad in many places, and it was almost impossible for loaded wagons to
                    travel outside of the beaten track. No vehicles except wagons were obtainable in the new country,
                    neither could they have been used in but few places; so travelers went either on foot, horseback, or
                    in wagons.</p>
            <p>Tunis Quick liked to relate the experience of himself and his wife when they visited her parents. At
                    first, they both rode on a little Indian pony and if Flatrock was high, they crossed it in a canoe
                    with the pony swimming behind. As their family increased they each rode a horse, carrying a baby in
                    front, and as the children increased in numbers and size, the larger ones were mounted behind. Once
                    the wife's horse laid down in the water, and when she was rescued by her husband, she was
                    holding her baby boy in such a close embrace that he was almost unconscious. Later, when there were
                    more children, if the whole family went visiting, the horses were hitched to the wagon, chairs were
                    set in for the parents, and the children were seated on straw in the bottom of the wagon.</p>
            <p>Men who rode on horse-back when it was muddy, wore <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-017-1-082"/> leggins, made
                    of thick, heavy cloth, and reaching from the tops of the feet to the knees. They were buttoned or
                    tied securely, and were quite a protection from wet, cold and mud. The men also carried saddle bags,
                    which held changes of clothing, or other necessities.</p>
            <p>The women wore riding skirts to protect their dresses. These riding skirts had large pockets on the
                    left side, and were very convenient for carrying necessary articles.</p>
            <p>Tunis Quick and his wife kept abreast of the times. They interested themselves in having the best
                    teachers for their children and in keeping up religious services in the Baptist church, and other
                    places of worship. They also encouraged the teachers of singing schools, or any other specialties
                    which they thought would be for the good of their family or the neighborhood.</p>
            <p>They bought improved utensils to use in their home and on the farm. They bought one of the two first
                    cooking stoves that were brought from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Also one of the first bureaus, bedsteads, tables and chairs of various shapes and
                    sizes.</p>
            <p>Their library was very small at first, but was gradually increased, as occasion demanded. A few law
                    books were necessary, and to these a book of history or biography was occasionally added; and
                    besides they had the Bible and the hymns of Isaac Watts, each of which is a library in itself. Isaac
                    Watts was a favorite poet with some of the pioneers, and they read or sang his hymns with pleasure
                    and enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>The first newspapers for the two political parties in Indiana were the <hi rend="i">State
                    Sentinel</hi> for the Democrats and the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal,</hi> later the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal,</hi> for the Whigs. Both papers were published in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and both were read with much interest; for the pioneers were patriotic and political.</p>
            <p>Tunis Quick was a Whig until the Republican party was founded, when he became a member of that party.
                    But he was never a bitter partisan and always treated his opponents with courtesy. He was always
                    interested in public affairs, and was often asked to write wills, settle estates and be guardian for
                    orphan children; in all of which he was honest, <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-017-1-083"/> capable and
                    trustworthy, winning the respect and gratitude of the interested parties.</p>
            <p>At that time there was a probate court "for proving the genuineness and validity of wills,
                    their registry and such other proceedings as the law prescribed, preliminary to the execution of the
                    will by the executor." For this court there was a judge called "a judge of
                    probate", or "probate judge". This office was satisfactorily filled for
                    six years by Tunis Quick.</p>
            <p>He was also a member of the state legislature for two terms. Some of his letters, written to his wife
                    during that time, in 1840, '41 and '42, are still cherished by members of his
                    family. These letters are written in a firm, plain hand, and in the dignified style of a gentleman
                    of the old school, reminding one of the letters of George Washington. He addresses his wife in most
                    endearing terms, and sends messages to each of his children, counselling them to be obedient to
                    their mother. He shows the most tender concern for the entire family, including the parents of his
                    wife, who were members of his household.</p>
            <p>He mentions the business of the legislature as "necessary work for the good of our
                    country", involving some hardships and sacrifices, and especially the absence from home,
                    adding that he does not wish to make such a sacrifice again. He is determined, however, to do his
                    duty to the best of his ability while there, and speaks of his colleagues with respect and
                        admiration.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was much interested in having the railroad built from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as he was tired of riding forty miles on horseback, through the mud, from his home to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>; and hauling grain and goods with a four-horse team, back and forth from his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName> home to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some members of the legislature very bitterly opposed building the railroad, and
                    declared that it would never pay expenses; but the "ayes had it", to their great
                    satisfaction, and inexpressible benefit to their posterity.</p>
            <p>The characters of such men as Judge Quick were invaluable during the pioneer work of the county and
                    state. One who knew him well said: "Judge Quick had his full share <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> See letters at close of this article.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="78" id="VAA4025-017-1-084"/> of the pleasures, responsibilities and hardships of pioneer
                    life, did his whole duty as a citizen; and as much as any other man in developing the county from
                    its primitive state to its present condition." To this was added by another admirer:
                    "His courage, activity, intelligence and uprightness have never been questioned."
                    His wife was a true helpmate, and in every way worthy of such a husband. They lived happily together
                    for more than sixty years on the farm which was bought at the "land sale" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1820.</p>
            <p>They had eleven children, eight of whom lived to maturity. It was one of Judge Quick's
                    ambitions to give to each one of these children "a quarter section" of good land,
                    which he accomplished, besides accumulating some other property. One farm of more than eighty acres,
                    which he owned, is now all inside the corporation of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a part of it is known as "Quick Heirs Addition."</p>
            <p>But the accumulation of property was not the chief aim of Judge Quick and his wife. They lived
                    honest, industrious, Christian lives, both being members of the Baptist church. Theirs was a
                    successful life in the truest sense, and they "entered into rest" full of years
                    and honors, and affectionately cherished in memory.</p>

            <p>James Quick, desiring to see the great west, moved near Circleville, O., on the <geogName>Scioto
                        river</geogName> and remained there a few years, then went down the river to the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1817. His son Tunis, in company with Isaac Pancake, with their guns and
                    ammunition and knapsacks, started out to explore the country and find a good farming location. They
                    followed Indian trails, traveling in a northwesterly direction over the route that afterwards became
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> state road. They passed through what was later known as the Hawpatch in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, they went as far north as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then returned to the Hawpatch and took a squatters right to 160 acres of land, built a
                    cabin and commenced "a clearing" to plant in the coming spring. They then returned
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and in the early spring assisted James Quick and family to move to the new cabin which
                    was destined to be their permanent home.</p>
            <p>Quite a few families arrived this year (1819) and the people went for miles to assist each other in
                    rolling logs to clear the ground and build their meager homes.</p>
            <p>William Chapman built the first house in the county seat. Jacob Hauser and Joseph Lochenour, from <placeName>
                        <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>
                    </placeName>, and Tunis Quick, helped him with the building in 1820 or 1821. There was quite an
                    increase in the population of the county. The land in this part of the state came into market by the
                    government and was sold at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. James and Tunis Quick bought their 160 acres at this time. It has been owned
                    and occupied continuously by them and <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-017-1-090"/> their descendants without
                    the title going out of the family and not a mortgage, judgment or lien of any kind against it. It is
                    a rare occurrence that a farm is owned and occupied with a clear title for one hundred years by the
                    same family.</p>
            <p>Tunis Quick was made justice of the peace of Flatrock township and served for several years in that
                    capacity. Later he was elected representative to the legislature for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown counties</region>
                    </placeName>. Later still, he served for many years as judge of the county court. Probably he
                    settled more estates than any man in that county at the time and was known as an able jurist. He
                    owned a good library for that early day and was widely read to the degree of being a student.</p>
            <p>He gave the ground and was instrumental in having the township build a school house with regular
                    school sessions. His house was the center of the community and he took an interest in the welfare of
                    everyone. He pulled their teeth, settled their disputes, performed their marriages. He annually
                    brought into his family a tailor and shoemaker who made and repaired the family wardrobe.</p>
            <p>His home was always open to the teacher who must board around, not always finding comfortable
                    quarters; the itinerant preacher who traveled through the country always found a warm welcome and a
                    place to relieve the burden of his soul. Judge Quick would put his several boys on horseback and
                    send them as runners through the country announcing there would be preaching at a certain time. The
                    audience was never failing as all seemed anxious to hear the word of God. The lecturer, too, always
                    had his interested audience with his knowledge of the outer world, on spiritualism, hypnotism,
                    ventriloquism and other isms of the day.</p>
            <p>The politicians knew him far and wide and called at his house frequently remaining over night. Henry
                    Clay was one of his special friends and was in the group of enthusiasts that rode on horseback to
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> Battle Ground in the Harrison campaign in 1840. This same year Governor Metcalf,
                    Senator Crittenden and Henry Clay stopped at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Whigs from the surrounding country went in to hear them speak. Metcalf and
                    Crittenden could not satisfy the crowd, who wanted to hear <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> who was at the <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-017-1-091"/> hotel resting. They sent a committee
                    after him consisting of William Herod and others, Herod being well acquainted with <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> while serving in congress. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> made a wonderful speech, but one fellow yelled "hurrah for Jackson". <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> straightened himself up, looking a foot taller and in his drastic manner said:
                    "You say, ‘Hurrah for Jackson’. I say, ‘Hurrah for my
                    Country.’" The unlucky fellow was the cause of the audience hearing one of the
                    most eloquent, scathing and tremendous speeches ever uttered by man. He denounced Jackson and his
                    administration. His words were so burning, his audience so in sympathy and the excitement so
                    intense, that it was with difficulty that the Jackson man was taken from the room by his friends.
                    Clay spoke for half an hour, and when he finished his admirers followed him to the hotel cheering.
                    The next morning the noted Kentuckians started for their homes traveling in their private
                    conveyances.</p>
            <p>William Henry Harrison was nominated for president of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and Tyler for vice-president The country was wild with its "Hurrah for
                    Harrison and Reform" and "<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and Tyler Too".</p>
            <p>This campaign was known as the hard cider campaign. At that time <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew counties</region>
                    </placeName> elected state senators and representatives together. The democratic candidates were
                    Maj. Tannehill for senator and Col. T. G. Lee for representative. The Whigs were William Terrell, a
                    Methodist minister for senator and Tunis Quick for representative. It was a hot campaign, the
                    candidates stumped the two counties, traveling horseback. At that time the majority of the people
                    voted at the county seat. Tunis Quick lived on the most public road leading to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had a large apple orchard and he had made a great many barrels of cider to be given
                    away on election day which was held on the first Monday in August.</p>
            <p>The emblems of the hard cider campaign were buckeye log cabins, coon skin caps with a buckeye cane.
                    The morning of the election he had several barrels of cider rolled out to the large front gate at
                    his home, the gate post being decorated with log cabins and coon skins. The barrels were so arranged
                    that his little boys could draw the cider in tin cups and give it to all who passed.</p>
            <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-017-1-092"/>
            <p>There were a great many barrels of cider taken to the courthouse yard at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The heads were taken out of the barrels and tin cups placed so that all could help
                    themselves. Cider was free for all.</p>
            <p>The Democrats in order to compete with the Whigs bought barrels of corn whisky, which was very cheap
                    at that time, and placed it in the courthouse yard near the public well and also placed a barrel of
                    sugar, with the head knocked out and tin cups near, so that all could help themselves and make their
                    own "grog". Towards evening a great many were drunk. They said it was too much
                    trouble to make and mix their own "grog", so they poured the barrel of whiskey and
                    the barrel of sugar into the well and then "grog" was ready on a large scale and
                    was pumped freely for all.</p>
            <p>I was twelve years old then and it was my first time to see or know anything about an election for
                    president. The wild yelling, singing, fisticuff and fighting, the bloody noses and faces, all made
                    an impression on me never to be forgotten. Harrison and Tyler were elected president and
                    vice-president, and my father to the legislature.</p>
            <p>One of the first water mills in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName> for grinding com into meal for the pioneer's use, was on <geogName>Flat Rock
                        river</geogName>, about six miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> near the present county bridge, leading from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Taylorsville through the Hawpatch. This mill was a hand mill that some pioneer had
                    brought with him. It was hard work and slow work to grind by hand. This man conceived the idea of
                    running it by water so that it might run day and night to accommodate all who might come. Before
                    this no one was allowed to bring more than one bushel of corn at a time which they generally carried
                    in a sack on the shoulder. When they arrived at the mill they had to await their turn and then turn
                    the mill by hand themselves. During the waiting time they would visit, crack jokes, etc. Nathan Bass
                    who was quite a joker and wit, said "the mill was the most industrious little thing that he
                    ever saw, that when one grain was ground it would jump right on to another."</p>
            <p>There was a place where the water ran very swiftly. The miller cut a small tree that was quite tall
                    and with the help of his neighbors placed it across Flatrock. He put one end in <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-017-1-093"/> the fork of a tree and the other end on a post that had a crotch or
                    fork similar to the one on the opposite side of the river. In the center of the river were paddles
                    or wings that extended into the water so that the current of the water would roll the log and would
                    keep it whirling over and over. On the end of the pole next to his mill he put a pulley or large
                    wheel for a belt and from that to his mill, so the rolling of the pole by the water would run his
                    mill day and night if necessary. With this modern improvement customers did not have to wait so long
                    for their meal. This crude water power was the forerunner of a dam being built across the river near
                    this point and a flour-mill, woolen factory and saw-mill located here. This became quite a little
                    manufacturing center at one time, a village of about three hundred people but when the railroad came
                    the factories were all moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> near the station. So the village soon became deserted.</p>
            <p>The community changed rapidly. Many country schools of fifty to sixty pupils are entirely out of
                    existence. The land has been bought by the wealthy men and converted into large farms. The children
                    now attend some district center or go to town to school. The timber has been nearly all cut away,
                    the fields are large and cultivated by machinery–they produce more to the acre now than
                    they did fifty years ago, and it is more easily cultivated as the stumps and roots are all gone; the
                    country is all in cultivation and produces three times as much as it did, with less labor. The land
                    now is selling for $200 or $250 per acre. When I first recollect it sold from
                    $2 to $10. My father bought a farm of 100 acres for $10 per acre
                    amounting to $1,000. He also bought the first farm that sold for $50 per acre,
                    one hundred acres for $5,000. Francis J. Crump who was the wealthiest man at that time in
                    the county, owned more land than any one else, said to my father "My God, Judge, what do
                    you mean by paying such a price for farm land, you nor I will never see it worth any more".
                    They both lived to see it sell for $100 per acre. My father's home place of 160
                    acres bought at the government sale in 1821 cost $1.25 an acre. It is still in the Quick
                    name. Father deeded it to my oldest sister Hannah Quick who never married and is now eighty-two
                    years old.</p>
            <pb n="88" id="VAA4025-017-1-094"/>
            <p>At present it is worth $250 per acre. I have lived to see the price of land go from
                    $5 to $250 per acre. Then two-thirds of it was in timber, now vast fields of
                    golden grain abound.</p>
            <p>Formerly there was a family of ten to fifteen children on every 40 to 160 acres. It was an old saying
                    "that the more children the richer the farmer grew", the more land he could clear
                    and the more he could cultivate without hiring help. The size of the families was the cause of such
                    large schools all through the country. We only had three or four months of school a year. We had no
                    school funds. Each patron would subscribe as many pupils as he thought he could spare and would pay
                    for that many. In addition to that he had to furnish, cut and deliver a half cord of wood to the
                    school house for each scholar. The teacher collected his own money from the patrons. He boarded
                    around among the families–so long for each pupil. He carried his dinner with him.</p>
            <p>Some times we would have a summer school of a few months taught by a lady or some student who wanted
                    to make expenses. At such times the small children would attend the school. Our school books were
                    the elementary spelling book, that had from the A, B, C's to the grammar, Talbot's
                    Arithmetic, the English Reader, the Testament and the Lives of Our Great Men, Washington, Marion,
                    Benjamin Franklin, Daniel Boone, David Crockett and others. Our spelling, reading and grammar we got
                    from the spelling book. I have known children to go to school three months with no book but the
                    alphabet and their spelling lesson pasted on a paddle made of a shingle or piece of board. When it
                    would become soiled so that they could not use it they would have another one pasted over it. Many
                    of our best business men, bankers, jurists and judges only attended school six months at a time, yet
                    they were very successful, some even becoming millionaires and many accumulating their thousands,
                    men who could scarcely write a legible hand.</p>
            <p>When I was a boy there were three brothers by the name of Thayer who came to our country from the
                    east. They were called Yankees. Each bought some cheap land, Joseph on a small creek, called Tuft
                    creek, from the fact that it ran through a low swampy country and was miry so that cattle <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-017-1-095"/> could only cross it in certain places. He made his living principally
                    by hunting, trapping and making salaratus by burning a certain kind of timber and using the ashes,
                    and selling it to the housewives to raise the bread in place of soda. He dressed or tanned deer and
                    other skins such as otter, coon, mink or any furbearing animal. He also hunted the wild bees,
                    cutting the trees to get the bees and honey to sell and use. He found a bee tree on the Drake farm.
                    It was a large fine oak tree. The bees were in a large limb near the top. He went to see Mr Drake
                    about cutting the tree. Drake said, "No, it is a fine tree, I want it to make boards when I
                    build a barn, and I'm not able to build for a few years. If you can get the bees without
                    cutting the tree down you are welcome to them." He went away and Drake thought no more
                    about it. Some months afterward, while squirrel hunting in that part of his timber, Drake saw the
                    tree ruined by being bored full of holes and wooden pins driven in from bottom to top of the tree.
                    He had bored a hole about three feet from the ground, put a long heavy pin in it, gotten on it and
                    bored another and so on until he reached the limb that held the bees. This he went out on, sawed the
                    outer end off, then went back to the body of the tree, fastened a rope around the limb and tied it
                    to a pin, then sawed the limb off and let it down with the rope. Mr. Drake said he could not say
                    anything to Thayer, as he had told him he could have the bees if he would not cut down the tree. All
                    he did was blame himself.</p>
            <p>Thayer came by father's once in November. It had been raining for two or three days. He had
                    been to the east fork of <geogName>White river</geogName>, trapping and hunting. He led a small
                    donkey loaded with traps and skins. I saw him coming up the road. I told him that a coon lived in
                    one of the top limbs of a large black walnut tree just a little way back of the barn. I told him to
                    put his donkey in the straw shed where he would be in the dry and could eat straw. Then I showed him
                    a black walnut tree that was about three and a half feet in diameter and forty feet to the first
                    limb. I said, "I think the coon lives in the hole in that largest limb." After he
                    examined the tree he said that it had been climbing up and down and showed me the scratches. A
                    hackberry tree grew some eight <pb n="90" id="VAA4025-017-1-096"/> feet from the walnut and was very
                    tall. Thayer took off his outer coat, put his little axe in his belt and climbed the hackberry. He
                    cut off the very top and then trimmed the limbs off down to and opposite the large branch of the
                    walnut tree. When he could push the hackberry over on the walnut, he took his belt and fastened it
                    there. He walked over on it to the walnut and out on the limb to the hole, where he knelt and pushed
                    his axe handle into it saying, "Cooney here?" Then he cut a larger hole in the
                    limb, killed the coon with the axe, and threw it down, came down as he went up, put on his coat,
                    picked up the coon and was ready to go, but as wet as water could make him. I took him to the house
                    for something to eat, but he would not go in because his clothes smelled too badly of musk rats and
                    skins. However, I took him to the kitchen where the maid gave him a hot cup of coffee and let him
                    warm, for which he thanked me many times for years.</p>
            <p>His brother, Charles Thayer, bought a small tract of land and commenced clearing it after building a
                    cabin home and covering it with bark from dead trees. He climbed the trees and cut the top out, then
                    as he came down he cut all the limbs off. He said that was easier than to cut the trees down and
                    have the bodies of the tree to burn. Burning the limbs around the tree would kill the tree and it
                    was no more in the way than the stump would be. He finally concluded that it was easier to deaden
                    the trees by chopping around them in June when the sap was up. When dead they could easily he burnt
                    up. He never made a success as he was too lazy to work or hunt except when compelled to. The other
                    brother, Ira, got forty acres of land on Haw creek, built a little corn cracker mill, also a
                    saw-mill and made a fair living. He had but little education, was a great abolitionist and would try
                    to make abolition speeches. For a joke my father had him elected justice of the peace for Flatrock
                    township to defeat a man by the name of Hege who boasted that he had married into the McQueen family
                    which was a royal family and they could control the vote of the township; that no one could beat him
                    but Judge Quick for that office. Father spent a couple of days in the township, and elected Thayer.
                    He gave bond, took the office and a man from near Hope in <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-017-1-097"/>
                    Hawcreek township was the first to have a suit in Thayer's court. His name was Calvin
                    Bloom. When he came up for trial he saw that Thayer did not know how to try a case. Bloom got mad,
                    called Thayer a fool and said he would give him a dollar to resign his office. Thayer took the
                    dollar and resigned.</p>
            <p>Joseph Thayer, the hunter and trapper, made more money and a better living than either of his
                    brothers. He had a good farm and raised a large family. He learned how to dress fur pelts, also the
                    deer pelt for gloves and whang-leather for shoe strings and belts. I bought of him two very fine
                    otter skins nicely dressed for my wife to have her first set of furs, and when they were made up
                    they were very beautiful. The trapping and hunting of the fur-bearing animals was profitable in
                    those days, and it was also necessary in order to protect the corn crops, as the raccoons, opossums
                    and squirrels were very numerous. As many as 70 or 80 were killed in a day.</p>
            <p>The wild turkeys were also numerous, the deer would eat the corn at any stage of its growth to
                    maturity. The raccoons and opossums infested the corn fields by night, breaking down the stalks and
                    eating the roasting ears, or leaving it to go to waste. There was something to destroy the corn crop
                    from the time it was planted until it was matured and in the crib. The crow and the chipmunk would
                    pull it up when it began to come up, to get the grain, the muskrat would cut it down at any stage
                    where it was near the water, so that eternal vigilance was necessary on the part of the farmer. His
                    children and their dogs were continuously on the outlook for vermin, in order to have plenty of meal
                    for their johnny cakes, corn dodgers and to feed their hogs for meat or bacon for the coming season.
                    They gathered their corn by pulling the ear off the stalk, hauling and piling under sheds, then
                    husking at their leisure. They saved the husks for feed for the cows. Poorer farmers who did not
                    have sheds would put the corn in a large pile, make a corn shucking by inviting all the neighbors to
                    come at night and help. They would furnish them some whiskey to drink and after the corn was husked
                    give them their suppers and a dance.</p>
            <pb n="92" id="VAA4025-017-1-098"/>
            <p>In the fall and winter the farmer and his boys would have their turn. Then the raccoons paid for
                    their pilfering with their pelts. Snares, dead falls and steel traps were set about the corn fields
                    and in places where they frequented such as bayous and marshes, where frogs abounded which were
                    their natural food. In this way many coons and fur-bearing animals were caught.</p>
            <p>When the men and boys wanted a night of sport they went coon hunting. A number would get together,
                    some with axes, others to carry the old fashioned tin lantern, or torches made of hickory bark,
                    which could be replenished at any old shell bark hickory tree. All the coon dogs, always including
                    the lop-eared hounds, followed. They would start soon after dark and go along the creeks, marshes or
                    pawpaw thickets, and when the dogs would strike a trail music would begin. Then the hunters would
                    rush through the woods over logs through the brush or briers over the fences aiming to keep within
                    hearing distance of the dogs. When they ran the raccoon to ground or up a tree all would make a rush
                    crying, "They have him treed." If the tree was not too large or valuable the axes
                    were plied at once. When the tree was about ready to fall the members of the party except an axe man
                    and one torch man would scatter well out of the reach of the falling tree and hold the dogs until
                    the tree fell to the ground. Then the dogs would rush in and make short work of the coon. The party
                    would move on till the dogs struck another coon trail or treed a possum in a bush. A damp foggy
                    night was best as the scent of the animal was more perceptible and more animals were out on the
                    trail so that many fine coon pelts would be secured besides those of a few possums thrown in for
                    good measure. The skins were taken off at once and the next day they were carefully cleaned and
                    stretched and hung or tacked against the cabin to dry.</p>
            <p>There are always some funny incidents happen with all such hunting parties. I recollect that once on
                    a hunt we had a man with us who was slow of speech and stammered. The dogs treed a coon up a small
                    dead elm in a corn field. He said, "It will be hard to cut and I will climb it and shake
                    the raccoon out." He proceeded to climb, at once, with the <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-017-1-099"/> aid of the men boosting him until he could reach the first limb. He got
                    up quite a ways when he caught hold of a dead limb that broke. He fell to the ground, immediately
                    the dogs piled onto him and pulled at him as though they would tear him to pieces. He hollered,
                    "Gi-gi-git out–I'm n-n-no rah-coon," and the wit of our crowd
                    was a <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Dutchman who roared out laughing. Someone said, "What's the matter,
                    Charlie?" "Why, that fool can't say coon without putting rah to it when
                    he is being half killed."</p>
            <p>Our next catch was a fine, large, fat opossum which Charlie proposed to eat, building a fire to roast
                    it. He went home, which was not far, and got some bread, as his wife had baked a brick oven full
                    that day. One of the boys went with him and carried a torch. We soon had a fine fire and the opossum
                    roasting near it. Presently Charlie and his torch-bearer came with large loaves of bread and two
                    apple pies–we all gave him three cheers. We sat around the fire "and told
                    hunting experiences and jokes. When the opossum was done we had a feast not forgotten soon. All gave
                    Charlie's wife a vote of thanks for her bread and pie and passed a resolution:
                    "Resolved, that Mrs. Charlie Bruner was the best baker in the township." After
                    which we adjourned for the night and plodded our weary way homeward.</p>
            <p>The first railroad was built in this state from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> via <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
               </placeName>, Edinburg and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When it was completed as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, there was one train a day each way. Our roads through the state were unimproved and
                    principally through the woods without bridges across any of the water courses. My mother was very
                    sick and my father wanted Dr. Todd from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There were no telephones, telegraph or daily mail. The quickest, best and only way was
                    to send someone on horseback for the doctor–a distance of twenty-five miles. It was ten
                    o'clock at night when father called me, saying, "Get up and get ready as soon as
                    you can, you must go to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> for the doctor." He then called my older brother and told him to go and get
                    Jock saddled and bring him out for me to ride, he being the best traveling horse we had. When I was
                    ready to start, father said, "Don't spare the horse, you must get there by six in
                    the morning. Go to Dr. Todd's home <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-017-1-100"/> and, tell him to
                    make the morning train at eight a. m. I will meet him at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After you have done that take your horse to the livery barn, water and feed him, then
                    get your breakfast. Ask the landlord for a bed and tell him to call you in four hours, then you
                    start home and give the horse his time."</p>
            <p>My commission filled to the letter, by ten o'clock I was on the way home. After riding some
                    distance I heard my name called. On looking down the stream I saw a man with a bucket. I asked what
                    he wanted. He said, "Come take dinner with me." I was tired and hungry, so quickly
                    replied, "Alright." I rode down into the woods a short distance to a little old
                    log cabin, with a mud and stick chimney and puncheon floor. Here my friend introduced me to his
                    wife. He told her I had come to dinner with him. She said, "Wood Herod, you ought to be
                    ashamed of yourself–you know that we have nothing to eat but corn meal and the mussels
                    you have gathered." "That's all right," he said, "he
                    will enjoy them–you get things ready while I feed his horse." He then went to
                    his fathers corn crib, not far from there, and got corn enough for the horse. His wife built the
                    fire in the fireplace and made corn bread and baked it in a skillet. He fixed the fire to put the
                    mussels on. We had a good dinner and I enjoyed my first mussels. As I was tired and hungry, the
                    novelty of it also made it enjoyable. The menu was corn dodgers, mussels on the half shell and water
                    from the creek for dessert. The furnishing of the cabin was unique and home-made. The seats were
                    wooden stools, the table was boards laid across a couple of benches, the bedstead was holes bored in
                    the logs, a rail put in them, the other end in a post at right angles and boards gathered from the
                    driftwood laid on the rails and extending to the cracks between the logs. There was a straw mattress
                    on that. With a box or two for their clothing, this constituted the furnishing of the house. Mine
                    host was only seventeen–his wife twenty-three. They had married against his
                    father's will, so this was the cause of their living where they were and the way they were.
                    His father, James Herod, was well to do, owned a good farm and was sheriff of the county. The
                    hostess had no relatives in Indiana but a sister, who was her father-in-law's <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-017-1-101"/> second wife, whom she called on at times. She finally-picked up courage
                    and called on her father-in-law and told him "that if he would help them some they could
                    make a living." He asked her how and she told him that she had been to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> and found a house on the street near the courthouse square that they could rent
                    furnished. If he would rent it for them, they could make a living keeping boarders and giving meals.
                    Woody could peel potatoes, wait table, wash dishes and she could do the cooking and they could make
                    a good living. He consented. This was the beginning of quite a good hotel, the second in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They continued in the hotel business all their lives, raised quite a family of
                    respectable children who acquired a good common school education, some of them married very well and
                    were good citizens.</p>

                    of the children. William walked beside the ox-team with his father, Millie and Elias were on
                    horseback a little to the rear while the remainder of the children were in the travel-stained,
                    dust-covered wagon. Joseph Cox was armed with a gun and the older boys carried axes. They halted on
                    the bank of the creek and took a survey of the place. The children peeped from the wagon and later
                    tumbled out, two of them engaged in a wrestling match. Mary left the wagon, being solicitous about
                    Millie and Elias. Cox said, "Well, Mary, we have traveled a long way since we left Carolina
                    and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and we have seen all kinds of country, but I tell you, I haven't seen any
                    country in all this time that I <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-017-1-102"/> like as well as this around
                    here. I don't think that we will find a place that is any better to settle than right here.
                    What do you think?" "Well, if you are a mind to stop here, I am willing."
                    "I was just thinking as we were riding along here that this is the land that flows with
                    milk and honey. The hunting and the trapping ought to be mighty good here and we can soon clear a
                    field." "You are right, Mary, the mountains of old <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> are pretty enough to look at, but this land along this valley is a better place to get
                    a living." "Yes, Joseph, God will bless us here and other settlers will soon be
                    coming along this wagon track that we have cleared out. I allow this will be a good place to bring
                    up our children; you know we have a fair sized family, Joseph, and we want to do the best we can for
                    them." "Yes, Mary, that's so and they are all girls but ten. We are the
                    first here, but others will come. About our graves in this county, cities and towns will spring up
                    and crowd the farms that we are to clear. In the generations yet to come, some may be curious to
                    know who was the first white woman that came into this land which has upon it the smile of the Lord.
                    Then, people will be happy to know that your name was Mary and that a woman bearing that name was
                    their Pioneer Mother."</p>

                        <p> Most affectionate and loving companion:</p>
                        <p>I now take my pen in hand to inform you that I am in good health at present. Hoping
                                    that these few lines may find you enjoying your health much better than when I left
                                    home. I have had much uneasiness for you but through the mercies of an allwise
                                    Creator I hope to hear of your recovering your health together with your family
                                    enjoying peace and satisfaction or at least so much so as possible. I have taken
                                    boarding at Mr. Lingenfelter's the same place that I was last winter. I
                                    should have written sooner but the mail has not left here for <placeName>

                                    </placeName> since I came on account of bad road. The members are all in health at
                                    this time. I expect to come to see you next Saturday no providential accident
                                    occurring, when I hope I shall find you with your family enjoying the blessings of
                                    life. I wish you to spare no pains nor money for the recovery of your health and

                                    Attend to keeping good fires. Attend to feeding all stock and watering in due time.
                                    I would just say to my little daughter that I wish you to behave very pretty and

                        <p>I again take my pen in hand to inform you that I am well at this time and hope when
                                    these few lines come to hand they will find you with yours and mine in health. I
                                    have not received any letter from you since I was at home. I heard from you by Mr.
                                    J. F. Jones and by him sent you a letter but have not as yet received any answer.
                                    The mail had missed coming for three days but came in this morning, but nothing for
                                    me from my beloved of all. There is some sickness here, mostly bad colds. There is
                                    at this time some five or six of the members confined to their rooms. Hugh Barnes
                                    departed this life yesterday morning, age sixty-nine years. He was the sergeant at
                                    arms in-our House. There was a resolution adopted that the legislatures should wear
                                    crape on the left arm ten days in honor of that venerable old man and also that the
                                    members of both houses meet at the place where the corpse lay and march in double
                                    file after the corpse to the Methodist church, where the Rev. Mr. Good preached his
                                    funeral. I went in that procession and then went to the place of interment to pay
                                    the last respects. George Boon also departed this life last night, age fifty-seven
                                    years, who has been eleven years a representative, a man much respected. It is
                                    supposed that his friends will take him home which is about one hundred miles. A Mr.
                                    Hannah is at this time not expected to live. Those men were all complaining when
                                    they came here and have possibly exposed themselves too much for their situation,
                                    sitting in a warm room and then going out without their overcoats on, which I
                                    believe to be very injurious to health. I have been very careful myself and have
                                    enjoyed as good health if not the best health I have for several winters. I am
                                    getting quite fleshy. I can't <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-017-1-104"/> tell you
                                    when I will be at home. I expect the House will not adjourn before the 8th of
                                    February, but I don't think that I can stay here until then without coming
                                    to see you once in the time but if business is so that I can't come you
                                    must all take the will for the deed. I should be very glad to see you all but as it
                                    is I must attend to the business of the country. In your next letter write how your
                                    father and mother are and all the children and father and mother and the neighbors.
                                    I should be glad to hear of their welfare and give my respects to those who inquire
                                    after me and tell them that I send my respects to them.</p>

                        <p>My dear wife:</p>
                        <p>I now am sitting in my room and thinking about her I love and although I have nothing
                                    strange to inform you of yet if I could know that you could even be as much
                                    delighted to read my poor dry letters as I am to read those interesting
                                    communications I received from you written with your own hand, I should be tempted
                                    to write every day. My dear, I see from your letter that you have had a bad spell
                                    since I left home. Oh, if I could have been with you to have administered to your
                                    necessity it would have been a comfort to me to have the satisfaction of waiting on
                                    you, as I expect you needed my assistance. I hope when these few lines come to hand
                                    they will find you in better health than when you wrote to me. I have had my health
                                    very well since I left you. I wish you to take special care of yourself and if you
                                    need anything at all that money would bring, I wish you to have it gotten for your
                                    benefit and if you need a doctor send for him as soon as possible, but I hope you
                                    will not need one. I hope for your better health. I should be very glad to come home
                                    before we adjourn, but the business is so pressing that I don't think I can
                                    come home until we adjourn except your health gets worse than when you wrote to me
                                    and I hope the Lord will bless you in your affliction. I hope you will be as much
                                    reconciled as the nature of the case will permit. Although we be at a distance at
                                    this time I hope it will not be long until we shall have the pleasure of conversing
                                    with each other face to face and not by letter. Tell my little daughter, Hannah,
                                    that her Pop is well and wants to see her very much and Josiah, my sweet little son,
                                    you must be a very good boy and obey your mother and Pap will bring you and Hannah
                                    some candy. I think my son Gorrell will be a good boy. My son, you must obey your
                                    mother and mind your work. I don't think you will be bad. I want you to be
                                    a very smart boy so that when I come home I can have your mother tell me how good
                                    her little boy was while I was gone. Morgan, I wish you to attend to business like a

                                    your little brothers and above all take care of your dear mother and obey her in all
                                    her commands without murmuring and also your grandparents and you, my sons, Spencer
                                    and James, I want you to obey your mother in all she may be pleased to tell you to
                                    do. Do it without any murmuring. Mind your work but be good boys. 1 shall be at home
                                    before very long, say two weeks. Nancy, I want you to be very smart and good so that
                                    when I see you that I may have the pleasure of hearing that you have been a very
                                    good girl and I will buy you and Hannah each a new frock, if you will be good girls.
                                    My dear, it is now after ten o'clock and I have been up every night this
                                    week until after this time. I shall have to close this letter as I want to put it in
                                    the office very early in the morning before the mail leaves. I would be glad if you
                                    would write to me once a week anyhow and oftener if you think proper. When I have an
                                    opportunity to take your letter and read it over it appears like some faint
                                    murmuring conversation compared with that when we are in each other's
                                    embrace. My dear, I sincerely crave your happiness and your special company but as
                                    we are at this time at a distance I hope the Lord may bless us severally as we need

                        <p>Most affectionate and loving companion:</p>
                        <p>I now take my pen in hand to inform you that I am well at present, hoping that when
                                    these few lines come to hand they will find you and ours in health. I received yours
                                    of the 11th inst., which informed me that you were much better than when you wrote
                                    to me last, which I was glad to hear that you were still mending. This was a great
                                    satisfaction to me. I was at the postoffice late this evening, but no letter. I did
                                    hope to get one but I was disappointed. I call at the postoffice every day. I shall
                                    be glad to hear from you. It does me a great deal of good to read your letters,
                                    knowing the confidence you place in me and to think of conversing with each other by
                                    letter it does me much good though we be at a distance from each other. Yet when I
                                    read your loving letters it gives me a great deal of pleasure hoping that ere long
                                    we shall embrace each other again and have each other's troubles. I would
                                    fain hope that when these few lines come to you they will find you up and at least
                                    up and going about the house and your pretty little daughter Hannah by your side or
                                    fondling on your knee. What a satisfaction this is, my sweet little daughter and my
                                    companion, I hope to see you all in health the 31st day of <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-017-1-106"/> January, 1842. I shall start for home, I think, on
                                    Sunday, the 30th inst. I want to see you and all very much. I hope the Lord will
                                    bless you all and give you peace and health, and fortitude to you, my dear, to bear
                                    up under your affliction so that you can say, "Thy will, Oh Lord, and not
                                    mine be done," for we learn that all things work together for them that
                                    love God. My dear, I should have come before now, if I could have left my business,
                                    but it appears to me that my presence was needed every day and is still needed but I
                                    think now that I never will spend another winter in the legislature, but spend the
                                    rest of my time at or about home where I can have the pleasure of my family which is
                                    the greatest pleasure to me of any other way that I have ever tried. You wrote to me
                                    that the children all behave very well which pleases me. I hope they will continue
                                    to be good children and I believe they will and obey you, their tender mother. My
                                    sons, I want you to attend to your work like little men. Mind and do your work in
                                    good time and take care of all the creatures and don't have any grumbling
                                    but mind your work night and morning and at all other times when needed and above
                                    all mind and obey your mother and be good boys. I shall soon be at home. I wish also
                                    to write you again next week and after that I think I shall talk with you at home.
                                    You told me that Amos Crane said that Russ had one hundred dollars for you and you
                                    did not know whether to take it or not. Don't take any money from any
                                    person, that is paper money, except it be on the State Bank of Indiana. I wrote to
                                    Amos Crane concerning the money he owes us and told him that I would receive it when
                                    I came home. Noah Sims wrote to me saying that Russ had five hundred dollars for me
                                    and he, Noah, wanted to borrow it for one year. I wrote to him that he could not
                                    have it under any consideration. I don't want to loan money to any person
                                    at all. I must now close my letter with all tender affections to you and my loving
                                    and tender companion.</p>

            <p>The biographical part of the volume consists of 33 pages, a brief straightforward account of a rather
                    uneventful life. Mr. Harding comes of a plain American family, nothing sensational either in the
                    family history or his own. His life is easily understood because he has always done the sensible,
                    practical thing.</p>
            <p>The twenty speeches given cover a rather wide range, but running through all is the moderation,
                    sanity and caution that characterize the man. Speech of acceptance, Safeguarding America,

            <p>The annual meeting of the Indiana Historical Society, on December 30, was marked by the resignation
                    of Judge D. W. Howe, who has been president of the society for twenty years, but who withdrew on
                    account of failing health. The resignation was accepted with regret, and a testimonial resolution as
                    to his services adopted. Officers for the ensuing year were elected as follows: President, Chas. W.
                    Moores; first vice-president, J. A. Woodburn; second vice-president, W. E. English; third
                    vice-president, Harlow Lindley; treasurer, Chas. E. Coffin; recording secretary, J. P. Dunn;
                    corresponding secretary, F. B. Wynn; executive committee, John H. Holliday, Logan Esarey, Mrs. Frank
                    Athon Morrison, Lee Burns, and Eliza Gordon Browning.</p>
            <p>The society decided to make one meeting of the Indiana Historical Conference next December a public
                    meeting of the Indiana Historical Society. Harlow Lindley and Lucy M. Elliott were appointed to
                    prepare the program. Resolutions asking the legislature to make provisions for preserving the battle
                    flags of Indiana troops in the Spanish-American and World wars were adopted. Dr. Wynn, Mrs. Morrison
                    and Miss Elliott were appointed a committee to prepare plans for securing the cooperation of all
                    societies interested in Indiana history, and report to the executive committee.</p>

                    was marked by a number of interesting papers. The three main topics, considered at some length,
                    were: Historical team-work; Patriotic and war history; and The centennial spirit. Dr. Benjamin F.

                    time in the late spring or summer. The county seat was first named Tiptona. The county was organized
                    January 8, 1821, and it has been suggested that the county and city celebrations be held at the same
                    time. George Pence of the State Board of Accounts has been asked to prepare an historical address.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Science, division of anthropology, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> last December, it was stated that almost nothing was known of Indiana archaeology.
                    Since that meeting George R. Fox, director of the Edward K. Warren Foundation, at Three Oaks, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, has been making an investigation of what has been done in Indiana. He finds that
                    beginning in 1869, a survey <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-017-1-116"/> was made county by county, by the
                    state geologists. He is very enthusiastic about the results of his investigation and says that the
                    state has no reason to be ashamed of what has been accomplished. These archaeological remains have
                    been located in part, at least. Now it is for the people of Indiana to see that more publicity is
                    given to their archaeological treasures and that these remains are saved. A real state museum with
                    adequate quarters would attract thousands and thousands of such relics.</p>

                    <p>Of all the historic Lincoln spots the least known is that area where Lincoln lived from his
                        seventh to his twenty-first years. The people of southern Indiana are urging Governor McCray to
                        reroute the proposed state highway from <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                        </placeName> to French Lick so it will pass through <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln City</settlement>
                        </placeName>, through the old Thomas Lincoln farm, past the home site of the Lincolns, past the
                        grave of Lincoln's mother, and all the other Lincoln landmarks. If this is done, a real
                        Lincoln Home Trail is built, then the automobile tourist passing that way may see, as he comes
                        from the east, the monument marking the hearthstone site in the Lincoln one-room cabin home, and
                        as he drives southwest-ward he will pass along the land Lincoln cleared and plowed. He will come
                        next to the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Memorial park, in the center of which is the monument erected by
                        Lincoln lovers to the memory of Lincoln's mother, who died when he was ten years old.</p>
                    <p>It seems strange, but Indiana has one of the most beautiful small parks in America there, with
                        fine roads all through it, and no way to get to the entrance other than over a dirt road
                        impassable over half the year. Passing by the park one comes to Little Pigeon church, primitive
                        Baptist. The original church was built 100 years ago; Thomas Lincoln helped build it, out of
                        roughly-hewn logs. This was the first church Lincoln attended; his father was one of the
                        officers. Long after the Lincolns moved to <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> the building was moved toward the road 100 feet, and the logs were boarded over on
                        the outside, the inside then being plastered. Inside are rough board benches, a home-made
                        pulpit, with kitchen chairs for the preacher. Immediately back of this church is the grave of
                        Lincoln's sister, Sarah Lincoln Grigsby.</p>
                    <p>Then, following the trail that Lincoln trod, one comes to Gentryville, the village nearest the
                        Lincoln farm a century ago. It was there Lincoln went to do odd jobs for townspeople, and to
                        read a <placeName>

                        the Gentryville store that Lincoln did his first debating, arguments swapped round the stove.
                        There he first became noted as a story teller. On farther is Boonville, where Lincoln found the
                        first [?] law books he read, and which gave him the foundation for a legal career. To the south,
                        in <placeName>
