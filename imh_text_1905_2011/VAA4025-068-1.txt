            Few members of President Benjamin Harrison's administration traveled so complicated a route
                    to political preferment as Stephen B. Elkins, secretary of war from 1891 to 1893. Elkins’
                    pivotal role in the Republican national convention of 1888, when he acted as a broker between
                    Harrison's managers and the followers of James G. Blaine, was well known at the time and
                    has since been documented by historians.1 What is less well known is why Elkins
                    took on the role of a Warwick and what reward he expected for his pains. The answer is simple:
                    Elkins wanted to be a 
                        United States
                     senator from West 
                        Virginia
                    . The problem was that he did not live in the Mountain State; thus, he naturally faced
                    competition there from native Republican leaders. These considerations forced him to adopt a
                    complicated strategy of maneuver in state and national politics. Harrison, for reasons of his own,
                    eventually fell in with Elkins’ strategy, but not before giving him some anxious moments,
                    first during the preconvention campaign of 1888, then during the period of Cabinet making and
                    remaking after he entered the White House.
            Elkins began his political career in the territory of New 
                        Mexico
                    , but he won national prominence as the manager of Blaine's several campaigns
                    for the presidency. Elkins’ ideas about a senatorial career dated back at least to 1879
                    when Blaine promised to make his protege "Senator from New 
                        Mexico
                     in two years," at which time, presumably, the Plumed Knight expected to place
                    the weight of the presidency behind a New 
                        Mexico
                     statehood bill acceptable to local land speculators.2 But Blaine
                    failed to win the presidential chair in 1880 or again in 1884, when Elkins acted as the architect of
                    his narrowly

                            Elkins’ senatorial ambitions can be inferred from his actions surrounding the New

                            delegate-cum-senator pattern in a letter to Elkins in 1891 and who in time became New

                        Cleveland
                    .3 In the meantime he turned to a post in James A.
                    Garfield's Cabinet as a suitable position for his friend but again ran afoul of the problem
                    of Elkins’ "domicile."4 In 1877 Elkins abandoned
                    New 
                        Mexico
                     as a residence but not as a political address; he settled first in 
                        Washington
                    , then in 
                        New York
                    , where he managed business interests extending to several states and territories.5 In a day when geographical considerations counted for much, Elkins sorely
                    needed a new political home. He also needed a new political patron after Blaine sailed away to
                    Europe in the summer of 1887 making uncharacteristic noises about retiring from politics.6 West Virginia supplied the first need; Harrison, the second. The key man in
                    each transaction was Elkins’ father-in-law and principal business partner, Henry Gassaway
                    Davis.
            It was not Blaine but Davis who sponsored the initial Elkins-Harrison political discussions in 1887.
                    A former Democratic senator from West Virginia from 1871–1883 with extensive mining and
                    railroad interests in the state, Davis had seen his own political career disrupted by factional
                    conflicts at home and his business interests threatened by the rising tide of tariff reform
                    sentiment in the national Democracy.7 By the spring of 1887 he concluded that
                    the interests of West Virginia coal producers would "be better served ... by a liberal
                    Republican [senator] than by a Free trade anti improvement Democrat."8
                    After repeated and unsuccessful attempts to distract President 
                        Cleveland
                     from the spell of the tariff reformers, he seems to have reached similar conclusions
                    regarding the presidency.9 At no time did Davis openly oppose candidates of his
                    own party; rather his strategy was the covert withdrawal of funds and
                    followers—"passiveness in certain quarters" as Elkins later

                             in 1864 at the age of twenty-three and had served successively as territorial
                            legislator, territorial attorney, federal attorney, and delegate to Congress. After he
                            retired from Congress in 1877, he remained in the East, although New 
                                Mexico

                     explained it to Harrison. Given the narrow balance of partisan
                    power in the nation and West 
                        Virginia
                    's recent elevation to the status of a "doubtful state"
                    thanks to impressive Republican gains in the 1884 and 1886 elections, Davis’ potential
                    influence was not inconsiderable.10 A long standing personal friendship with
                    Harrison made him all the more eager to cooperate with Elkins’ design if
                    indeed—as Elkins later hinted11—he did not instigate it.
                    Harrison and his family were frequent visitors at Deer Park, the Davis summer home atop the Maryland
                        Alleghenies.12 The Hoosier's 1887 sojourn at Deer Park was
                    different, however. In addition to the usual rich mixture of political gossip and mountain air,
                    Harrison's hosts offered the prospect of the presidency. Blaine, Elkins told him, might not
                    stand for renomination and if he did, might not get it. In that case Elkins could think of no one
                    more likely to win support of the "Blaine Legion" than Harrison. Davis advised his
                    guest to encourage any presidential boom that might develop and hinted at his own willingness to
                    support him.13 Harrison replied to these overtures with the modesty appropriate
                    to this stage of the campaign; but the idea had been broached, and none of the principals forgot the
                    conversations during the months that followed. By December, when 
                        Cleveland
                    's message to Congress lent powerful support to the tariff reform movement,
                    Davis was at work among disaffected Democrats while Elkins kept tabs on the growth of presidential
                    fever at 
                        Indianapolis
                    .14 By February Elkins was ready to resume with Harrison their
                    "several conversations last summer at Deer Park about the presidency."15
            
            On March 1, 1888, Blaine lent his approval to Elkins’ presidential strategy although he
                    said nothing and probably knew nothing about the West Virginia angle in the affair. In his
                    "Florence Letter" of January 25, the Plumed Knight had publicly renounced designs
                    on the presidential nomination, and subsequent private elaborations to Elkins discounted the
                    possibility of a draft.16 Blaine also cast a

                     shrewd eye on the remaining Republican hopefuls. John Sherman and
                    a clutch of favorite son candidates were "unavailable at critical points"; they
                    were hostile to Blaine and Elkins (Sherman), unattractive to business interests (Walter Q. Gresham
                    and William B. Allison), or could not be elected ("Evarts, Hawley, Phelps, Alger, Cullom,
                    Rush, et id omne genus"). The "one man remaining" was Harrison.17 Elkins passed on these assurances to Harrison as they arrived from Europe. He
                    did not write off the possibility of a draft nomination for Blaine and discussed it frankly with
                    Harrison. "I know he wants to escape the turmoil and excitement of another campaign, but it
                    is possible yet that the Convention may if it finds a sharp division between the other candidates
                    without result, go to Blaine by acclamation." Elkins thought that the best strategy was to
                    promote Harrison as a second choice candidate among the Plumed Knight's followers, thereby
                    reducing the chances of a stalemate.18 He had already passed the word around in 
                        New York
                     and would, he said, make the Indianian the heritor of Blaine's strength,
                    "At the proper time & when I think it will best serve your interest."19
            
            Elkins’ approach to Harrison was quite explicitly that of a Warwick. The "Blaine
                    element," he wrote, "will largely determine the result at 
                        Chicago
                    , and probably go where Blaine friends decide it is best to go."20 This was a clear invitation to bargain: what would Harrison do for Elkins in return for
                    his support in the nominating convention? Harrison's answers were disappointing.
                    His replies to Elkins’ advances were an adroit mixture of diffidence and encouragement.
                    He was profuse with reciprocal declarations of friendship and promptly responded to
                    Elkins’ inquiries as to his record and the political situation in Indiana. Beyond that
                    there were "some things I would say & some things I would ask you to say if we were
                    together, but about which I do not care to write."21 Elkins too had
                    confidences too deep to entrust to a letter but repeated attempts to draw Harrison east for a
                    conference proved futile. Harrison never really declined to come, but the obligations of his law
                    practice always managed to interfere with his coming, even when Davis offered suitable
                    "cover" for a secret meeting at Deer Park.22 Thus from the
                    beginning Elkins got a taste of that disdain for the byways of "practical
                    politics" that in time would isolate Harrison

                     from the bulk of Republican chieftains.23 For
                    the moment, however, Harrison's behavior could be passed off as the coquetry expected of
                    any potential nominee. While avoiding commitments, he was careful to respond encouragingly to
                    Elkins’ advances. Following Elkins’ advice, he spoke admiringly of Blaine in
                    public and did not oppose the selection of Blaine men as delegates to the convention.24 He detailed Louis T. Michener, attorney general of Indiana and the manager of his home
                    state "boom," to act as liaison with Elkins and other Blaine leaders.25 Eventually Michener went to 
                        New York
                     in late May to satisfy Elkins’ desire for a meeting. While he too was
                    instructed not to make commitments, his earlier hints of the benefits to be won by the engineers of
                    a Blaine-Harrison fusion left little to imagination. "General Harrison will be nominated
                    and elected," he assured Elkins; in which case "no good friend of Mr.
                    Blaine's will have any occasion to regret it, and I do not use this language lightly, for I
                    understand its full import, and mean it to be understood in that light."26
            
            Whether Elkins himself placed all his cards on the table at this point is open to interpretation. His
                    strategy required dangling the possibility of a draft before Blaine loyalists, and this necessitated
                    some deception of his Indiana friends. For example, around the end of April James S. Clarkson of 
                        Iowa
                    , Richard C. Kerens of 
                        Missouri
                    , and other "old time workers" came to 
                        New York
                     for a series of conferences with Elkins. Kerens subsequently sent word to Harrison that
                    he and Elkins had used the opportunity to press the Hoosier's candidacy and that
                    Blaine's prospects had hardly been mentioned. This last reference was patently untrue if
                    Clarkson's version of the talks is accurate.27 At the same time Elkins
                    told Harrison that he had laid the basis for cooperation between the latter's forces and
                    those of 
                        Iowa
                    's favorite son, William B. Allison.28 Possibly this was true. Through Clarkson and other friends on the national committee Elkins was
                    able to control the arrangements at the convention down to and including the ticket printing and
                        carpentry.29 There would be no unfriendly gallery such as had harrassed the
                    Blaineites 
                  
                     23 The literature on Harrison's personality and political
                            style is conveniently summarized in Morgan, From. Hayes to McKinley,

                     during their terrible struggle with Roscoe Conkling in 1880. At
                    the same time Elkins kept tabs on Blaine's old followers as they sought election as
                    delegates. "In general," Clarkson reported to Elkins after a leisurely tour on his
                    way back to 
                        Iowa
                    , "I may say that I find our old line of friends everywhere ready to act
                    together, and to unite at last. I carried everywhere the word you gave me, and the whole line is
                    thoroughly informed and ready to respond."30
            
            The "word" Elkins gave Clarkson may not have been the same one he gave Harrison.
                    But Harrison's managers recognized that Elkins’ usefulness to them depended on
                    his keeping the Blaine element in united and manageable condition. When Michener visited 
                        New York
                     on May 25, Elkins gave him advance notice of a second letter from Blaine reiterating
                    his declination.31 This ended the threat of a Blaine draft so far as Michener
                    was concerned, and he was convinced of Elkins’ loyalty. "With your
                    help," Michener wrote Elkins on his return to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , "we shall be able to get the greater part of the Blaine delegates, and thus
                    nominate our man."32
            
            Although Elkins continued to play his double game between Harrison and the Blaineites almost to the
                    moment of the final ballot, by the eve of the convention he appears to have been working mainly for
                    Harrison. Besides marshalling the Blaine forces and holding them in readiness for a switch, he
                    persuaded several influential eastern conservatives to regard Havrison as Blaine's legatee.
                    Among the converts he claimed were Benjamin F. Jones, the steel magnate, Whitelaw Reid of the 
                        New York
                    
                    Tribune, Charles Emory Smith of the 
                        Philadelphia
                    
                    Press, John King of the 
                        Erie
                     railroad, and Frank Thomson of the Pennsylvania railroad.33 A more
                    delicate problem was presented by the powerful 
                        New York
                     and Pennsylvania bosses, Thomas C. Platt and Matthew Quay. Jones reported Quay ripe for
                    inclusion in a Blaine movement, but as far as second line candidates were concerned, he was
                    conducting a flirtation of his own with Sherman. Jones suggested getting at Quay through Platt.34 Elkins had gone to work on Platt in March, but the approach of the convention
                    found the "Easy Boss" still "in a doubtful state."35 Although the struggle between organization and antiorganization forces in 
                        New York
                     was by no means over, Platt had established his

                     control sufficiently to secure a united delegation at 
                        Chicago
                     and was anxious to exploit this resource to advantage.36 He would
                    not spend his seventy-two votes hastily, however, and he promised to wait until Elkins had seen
                    Harrison before making up his mind. This lent a note of urgency to Elkins’ attempts to
                    arrange a conference with Harrison. But again the latter declined to come to Deer Park or to take
                    part in a furtive interview between trains that Elkins proposed for 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               .37 Elkins’ extreme reluctance to be
                    seen at 
                        Indianapolis
                     suggests a fear of compromising his authority in the eyes of those Blaine men who, like
                    Clarkson, were committed to one of the other favorite sons. However he was able to arrange suitable
                    precautions for secrecy and went to the Hoosier capital to visit Harrison on June 15.38 Again he was unable to secure an explicit commitment, either on his own account or on
                    Platt's. But what he got was enough. As he later reminded Harrison, "I made use of
                    your expressed determination to stand by your friends and my knowledge from our acquaintance that
                    you would surely do so," to convert the doubtful.39 Vague assurances
                    like these, transformed by the enthusiasm of intermediaries into all but explicit promises, were the
                    stuff of which presidents were made.
            The Republican convention of 1888 fascinated contemporaries and quickly became part of the political
                    lore of the age. The memoirs of the time focus on the critical weekend recess of June
                    23–24 and tell of midnight intrigues in 
                        Chicago
                     hotels, of messengers to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and telegrams to 
                        Washington
                    .40 There is no need here to go into details, except to note that
                    one of the more famous items concerned a Sunday morning carriage ride during which Elkins and Platt
                    were said to have determined upon Harrison's nomination. Whether Platt needed much
                    persuasion is a debatable point; most of the 
                        New York
                     delegation had broken to Harrison on the fourth ballot the previous

                     day.41 Thus it is probable
                    that—whatever may have been implied in their conversation—the Elkins-Platt
                    outing had mainly to do with the mechanics of swinging the convention into line, not a
                    "corrupt bargain."42 In any event 
                        New York
                     decided on Monday morning to vote as a unit for Harrison and to carry his standard on
                    the convention floor.43 Elkins was further armed with a cable from Andrew
                    Carnegie, Blaine's current host in the Scottish highlands, giving incontrovertible evidence
                    of the Plumed Knight's "unavailability" to lay before those of his
                    followers who were still on the fence and stating Blaine's preference for Harrison.44 The convention responded smoothly on the seventh ballot. The movement to
                    Harrison began with 
                        California
                    , the only delegation hitherto casting its vote solidly for Blame. Clarkson moved Iowa
                    into the Harrison column, and Quay delivered 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . The previously badly—one suspects deliberately—scattered
                    delegates of the New 
                        England
                     states and West Virginia went overwhelmingly for Harrison. 
                        Tennessee
                    , also previously divided, clinched the nomination with a nearly solid vote, a result
                    for which insiders gave Elkins credit.45
            
            The important thing about the convention was the difference between appearance and reality. From all
                    appearances it was an open convention, deliberating eight days and choosing the nominee from among
                    no fewer than nineteen candidates. In reality the result was dictated by a handful of men who
                    nominated Harrison, not because there was a widespread demand for his nomination but because they
                    wanted victory in the fall and the rewards that went with it; that required an uncontroversial
                    candidate in a campaign in which the tariff issue was expected to predominate over personal
                        appeals.46 Elkins played a critical role in producing the result; he
                    hastened to congratulate the nominee and left to Davis a direct statement of his claim on
                    Harrison's gratitude. "Perhaps it ought to come from some one else,"
                    Davis wrote Harrison on June 25, "but I know you will agree with me—that Elkins
                    did much to bring it

                            Elkins’ promise of the Treasury portfolio, which Elkins and Harrison always
                            denied. The matter is discussed in Louis L. Lang, comp. and ed., The

                     about."47 Harrison may be pardoned
                    for misunderstanding the nature of such claims. Having made no explicit promises, he believed that
                    he owed the nomination to no one and took it as a personal triumph. The opposite was closer to the
                    truth, but the misunderstanding was to cause Elkins in particular and the Republican party in
                    general no little grief during the next four years.48
            
            Although preoccupied during the preconvention period with his courtship of Harrison, Elkins had not
                    neglected the West Virginia side of his double campaign. With Davis’ help he arranged a
                    bipartisan protectionist rally at 
                        Wheeling
                     on February 29. At this rally, which was thinly disguised as a promotion of industrial
                    development, Elkins made his maiden political speech in the Mountain State. He also bought into the
                    leading Republican newspaper, arranged for the construction of a summer residence near the mountain
                    village of Leadville (shortly rechristened "Elkins"), and made a nonpartisan
                    address at the state university.49 After Harrison's nomination Elkins
                    concentrated on the West Virginia campaign. Aside from Davis’
                    "passiveness," for which Elkins claimed credit and which contributed to a
                    Republican gain of some one thousand votes in the upper Potomac mining region,50
                    Elkins’ most important achievement was the nomination of Representative Nathan Goff as
                    the Republican gubernatorial candidate. Brought about by a mixture of cajolery and pressure
                    organized by Elkins’ newfound newspaper allies, Goff's reluctant acceptance of
                    the honor promised to remove the foremost local claimant to the senatorship to which Elkins
                        aspired.51 In these circumstances the first results of the fall election
                    occasioned much joy among the members of the Deer Park circle. The unofficial vote showed Republican
                    victories in state and nation. "Your election is a source of great personal gratification
                    to the Davis family including myself," Davis wrote Harrison on November 8. To a West
                    Virginia protectionist who had remained loyal to

                     he noted: "The tariff question is one that hurt [the Democrats]
                    most." Blaine sent the President-elect "special felicitations" on the
                    result in West 
                        Virginia
                    . He asserted that it was "the beginning of the break in the Solid
                    South" and would insure the election of a Republican senator.52
            
            The next few days brought second thoughts, however. Harrison had indeed won the national electoral
                    vote but not West 
                        Virginia
                    's. 
                        Cleveland
                     carried the state by a margin of 500 votes out of 159,000. And there were further
                    complications, this time concerning Elkins’ own career. Contrary to Elkins’
                    hopes the election failed to take Goff out of the way. He continued to lead in the gubernatorial
                    count by 110 votes, but the narrow result invited a Democratic contest which was soon forthcoming.
                    The incumbent governor, a Democrat, refused to certify a winner, throwing the count into the
                    legislature. The composition of the legislature itself remained in doubt, but it eventually showed a
                    stalemate, with the balance of power belonging to three Union Labor delegates.53
                    Thus no one could be certain how the gubernatorial matter would be settled, to say nothing of the
                    impending senatorial contest. In these unpropitious circumstances Davis and Elkins met in 
                        New York
                    , probably on the week end of November 16.54 They decided to rely on
                    their friendship with Harrison to carry Elkins over the shoals. Davis wrote the President-elect
                    recommending himself as "a discreet friend in whom you have confidence" and
                    requesting an interview that would be "of value to you & the country."55 Partly because protocol demanded that the vice president-elect pay the first
                    call, partly to give the visit more "social" surroundings, Davis delayed his
                    journey to 
                        Indianapolis
                     until the Christmas holidays, December 23–25.56
            
            Some confusion developed as to just what Elkins wanted Harrison to do. With his gubernatorial status
                    in doubt Goff remained very much a live senatorial candidate. Did Elkins want Goff taken into the
                    Cabinet, thus clearing his senatorial path; or did he want a Cabinet post himself, abandoning to
                    Goff the unpromising situation at 
                        Charleston
                    ? After talking with Elkins in 
                        New York
                     and Richard C. Kerens in 
                        St. Louis
                    , Russell Harrison reported to his father that Elkins favored the former course:
                    "he preferred the position of Senator to that of a member of the cabinet and [thought] that
                    if he had a clear field he would enter the race earnestly and he believed

                    the reason being that "he could get the labor votes where Goff could not."57 It is interesting in this respect also that Davis requested interviews with

                    .58 On the other hand Davis mentioned nothing of the Goff project to
                    Harrison according to his own accounts of the meeting, while Elkins’ correspondence
                    indicates that he had fixed upon a Cabinet post as early as November 23.59 A
                    delegation of West Virginia Republicans, led by Charles Burdette Hart of the 
                        Wheeling
                    
                    Intelligencer, further complicated matters when it followed Davis to 
                        Indianapolis
                     on December 26. Publicly, Hart's group was committed to Goff. Privately, Hart
                    assured Elkins that "only ourselves know what the programme is" and on his return
                    to West Virginia termed press reports concerning the visit to 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    "pure fabrications." In fact the press reports were probably
                    correct; Hart and his friends appear to have double crossed Elkins, challenging his claim to
                    represent West Virginia and supporting Goff.60 Early in January Goff scotched
                        his Cabinet movement by informing Harrison that he was not interested in a
                    portfolio. By this time, however, the impression had been created in West 
                        Virginia
                    —and apparently too with Harrison—that Goff sought to block all
                    paths to preferments, an impression that naturally redounded to Elkins’ favor.61 "We all love [Goff]," John M. Hagans of Morgantown told
                    Elkins, "but it is asking too much, is it not, to expect a total surrender in all
                    directions?" With other influential leaders in the party's traditional
                    northern West Virginia strongholds Hagans began organizing a local movement in support of Elkins for
                    the Cabinet.62 But so long as the Goff faction continued to dispute his claim to
                    residence in West 
                        Virginia
                    , Elkins could not afford to base his candidacy for a Cabinet position on geographic
                    credentials alone.
            Consequently Elkins had to use an alternative basis for appealing to Harrison. His earlier career as
                    a territorial politician and lobbyist, involving such well publicized scandals as the Star Route
                    mail frauds, dimmed his chances for a merit appointment; he therefore sought the undemanding War
                    portfolio in which he had no economic

                     interest, but there was still opposition on the basis of his
                        past.63 In any case apparently neither he nor Harrison nor any of their
                    friends ever discussed whatever qualifications for executive office he may have had. His appointment
                    would have to discharge political obligations, and, aside from geography, these could be of two
                    sorts: personal or factional. Elkins could be credited to Harrison himself if the President-elect
                    sought—as Blaine had described Elkins to Garfield in 1881—"a strong
                    and valuable friend ... useful at odd times."64 In this respect Elkins
                    was hampered by the hostility of some of Harrison's Indiana advisers, especially William H.
                    H. Miller, Harrison's former law partner and future attorney general.65
                    Elkins’ foremost qualification was thus as a factional leader. In the Cabinet he would
                    represent the Blaine wing of the party; his appointment would also recognize his role at the 
                        Chicago
                     convention. But before Elkins could play this suit, Blaine stepped forward to cash the
                    chips Elkins had so carefully accumulated.
            Earlier Blaine had led Elkins and many others to believe that he did not wish to return to office
                    except perhaps as a senator from 
                        Maine
                    . On November 8, however, Blaine wrote Elkins that he had changed his mind. He wanted to
                    be secretary of state and expected Elkins to undertake a campaign of pressure to secure his
                    appointment. Above all he wanted him to clear up any impression Harrison may have gained that he was
                    not "available." Elkins waited until after his conference with Davis before
                    complying with this request and then agreed to do as Blaine desired.66 Blaine,
                    however, declined to reciprocate when informed that Elkins, too, was interested in the Cabinet. If
                    he were to place himself behind Elkins’ candidacy, he argued, it might be
                    "prejudicial to both of us. ... at present silence is my imperative duty on all personal
                    politics." Blaine nevertheless insisted that there was no conflict between them if Elkins
                    presented himself to Harrison on a geographic and personal, rather than factional, basis. According
                    to the Plumed Knight, West Virginia was Elkins’ "great, fruitful, decisive
                    field," while the Davis family's "years of intimacy" with the
                    President-elect offered him an inestimable

                                of James Abram Garfield (2 vols.,

                     65 Elkins believed the hostility to be based upon a
                            "misunderstanding" of his maneuvers between Blaine and Harrison before the
                            1888 convention. Actually Miller's distrust dated from 1886 when he blamed Elkins
                            for involving Russell Harrison in a speculative Montana land and cattle enterprise,
                            endangering Miller's own funds and those of other 
                                Indianapolis
                             citizens. Other investors blamed Russell more than Elkins for the affair.

                     advantage. These factors would do more, Blaine concluded, than
                    such "distant recommendations" as he or others might make. In short, Blaine was
                    accepting no riders in his own drive for preferment and was leaving Elkins to make it on his own as
                    best he could.67
            
            In view of Blaine's attitude and the uncertain picture in West 
                        Virginia
                    , Elkins elected to present his candidacy to Harrison on the basis of his personal
                    devotion and his political indispensibility to the new administration. Davis’ role was to
                    convert their long standing social relations with the President-elect into a political asset. In
                    this respect Davis’ December trip to 
                        Indianapolis
                     was moderately encouraging. The visit was a social success. Politically, he wrote,
                    Blaine's chances were good. "As to Elkins he stands well with the Gen[eral]
                    & family they talk nicely about him but Gen did not commit himself." On his return
                    to the east Davis imparted three important pieces of news: Harrison would make no decision for
                    several weeks and no announcement until the eve of the inauguration; he anticipated trouble in
                    meeting the claims of 
                        New York
                     Republicans; "Mrs H" and the family generally were favorable to
                    Elkins and Blaine. On his part, Davis had informed the President-elect that "No man
                    succeeded in business or politics by passing old friends for new ones."68
            
            The friendliness of the family was a useful counterweight to the hostility of Harrison's
                    political advisers. Elkins’ "services at 
                        Chicago
                     were greater than you imagine," Russell informed his father. "I am
                    the only one whom he really trusted as to his real position and what he was trying to do. All our
                    Indiana friends were mislead [sic], "69 The West Virginians also
                    appealed to the nepotism for which Harrison was later noted.70 Elkins held out
                    the prospect of a newspaper job for Russell, while Davis found a place for J. Robert McKee,
                    Harrison's son-in-law, in the West Virginia Central Railroad hierarchy, offering him
                    $2,500 a year and stock in one of the Davis-Elkins coal companies. Davis even offered
                    money to Harrison himself—a "draft for a few thousand to be return [sic] when it
                    suits you"—to tide him over preinaugural expenses. Probably this was going too
                    far. It appears that nothing more was said of the money, and McKee shortly thereafter turned down
                    the proffered employment.71 Harrison was willing to accept small favors,
                    however. Davis undertook to arrange for the inaugural train and got McKee a pass on the

                    cottage at Deer Park and made plans for a postinaugural tour of the South by members of the two
                        families.72 Meanwhile the Presidentelect's family remained useful
                    to Elkins for transmitting letters that he did not want Harrison's political advisers to
                        see.73
            
            While Davis worked to cement personal ties, Elkins set out to display his political usefulness to
                    Harrison. "I am keeping quiet and out of the way of Cabinet making and cabinet
                        makers,"74 he told the President-elect, when, as a matter of fact,
                    he was right in the thick of things. Following Davis’ return from 
                        Indianapolis
                     Elkins wrote to Jones of 
                        Pittsburgh
                     and other Republicans to get backing for his own campaign.75 More
                    vital to his success, however, was his intervention in the confused situation in 
                        New York
                    . There Boss Platt was endeavoring to collect on his alleged promise of the Treasury
                    portfolio and to insure to his organization control over patronage in the Empire State. Harrison was
                    willing to concede a share in the spoils but refused absolutely to include "State
                    bosses" in the Cabinet and insisted that Platt come up with a Cabinet appointee acceptable
                    to all 
                        New York
                     Republicans, including a rival faction headed by ex-Senator Warner Miller.76 Because of his presence and contacts in 
                        New York
                    , Elkins afforded an ideal "medium," as Harrison put it, in the
                    negotiations. The conflict in 
                        New York
                     also afforded Elkins an opportunity to demonstrate to Harrison "the interest I
                    feel in your success"77 and put the two men in direct communication
                    without breaching the facade of disinterest in his own advancement that Elkins was forced by custom
                    to maintain. Throughout January and most of February Elkins worked hard to secure the harmonious
                    result that Harrison hoped for. Eventually he came up with two potential appointees, Senator William
                    M. Evarts and Benjamin F. Tracy, a 
                        Brooklyn
                     lawyer, who were acceptable to both Platt and his rivals. Harrison gratefully seized
                    upon Tracy as his secretary of the navy.78 He also followed Elkins’
                    advice on the Treasury post, allotting it to the West and appointing William Windom

                        Minnesota
                    , another old friend of Davis and a frequent visitor to Deer Park. Another hopeful sign
                    was the appointment of Blaine as secretary of state, which position Harrison quietly tendered on
                    January 17.79
            
            Despite these signs of his growing influence, Elkins grew alarmed as the inauguration neared and the
                    pattern of Harrison's appointments began to emerge. With the exception of Blaine none of
                    the secretaries thus far designated were men of national experience, and none had taken a very large
                    role in the politics of 1888. It became apparent that Harrison was paying close attention to
                    geographic distribution and was seeking out men whose uncontroversial records and characters were
                    conducive, so he believed, to party harmony—men very much like himself, in other words,
                    which Elkins was not.80 He was ignoring those considerations which made
                    Elkins’ success most likely. Thus in the second week of February the latter determined to
                    buck the trend and to press his own candidacy more forcefully. Davis again appealed to Harrison, and
                    Blaine again declined to stick his neck out. The Plumed Knight did agree to ask Harrison to come to 
                        Washington
                     with his Cabinet slate unfilled, which Harrison agreed to do.81
                    Elkins arranged for a conference with the President-elect on Feburary 27.82 On
                    February 18, however, he learned that Harrison planned to award the Interior portfolio to an unknown
                    Missourian, and this information spurred him to make a bold representation in his own behalf. By
                    letter he lectured Harrison on the danger of overlooking "the claims of friends who have
                    felt that the proprieties would not be served by forcing themselves to your attention. ... To
                    abandon them in the formation of your Cabinet would, to my mind, reach the verge of
                    injustice." Blaine's silence notwithstanding, Elkins now brought forth his
                    qualifications as a factional leader. "The appointment of Mr. Blaine was wise," he
                    stated. "But it should not follow that Mr. Blaine, standing as an individual in the
                    Cabinet, should be held to satisfy the claims upon you of all of those who have heretofore been his
                    friend, and who were loyal to you long before and during the Convention, and who were strong and
                    brave enough to say to Mr. Blaine, in case he would not consent to be a candidate, you should be
                    nominated. ..." Furthermore, he argued, the appointees thus designated, though good men
                    all, had done little or nothing for Harrison when the chips were down. "[Blaine] was

                    the Convention ... Gen. Noble was quietly pursuing his profession and making money" in the
                    spring of 1888. Finally he urged Harrison to discount the advice of his Indiana friends. "I
                    am satisfied now that many things that should have reached you, and were written to Michener and
                    others for your ear, and spoken to your friends at 
                        Chicago
                    , never reached you, and to some extent you do not understand what has been
                    done." Lest Harrison miss the point of this outcry, Elkins advised that of the remaining
                    Cabinet places "two or three be taken from that number who stood by you in the East and
                    elsewhere when you needed friends ... who resisted all promises from other candidates, who answered
                    all arguments made against your claims, and who in the end made enemies for a life to serve
                    you." "All this happened," he concluded passionately,
                    "—you may not know it, but it did." As proof thereof he enclosed
                    extracts from letters of March, 1888, showing how Senator John Sherman had bid highly but
                    unsuccessfully for his services.83
            
            Asked to review a draft of this message, Davis advised against sending it,84 but
                    Elkins went ahead and was shortly in receipt of a reply. Harrison was equally frank. "I
                    have not set anyone aside because he was anyone else's friend," he stated; nor had
                    he "failed to think of my friends." He regarded Elkins’ loyalty as
                    proven and had paid no heed to hostile gossip. Rather it was "geographical and other
                    considerations not involving any lack of fondness or gratitude" that governed his decision.
                    Thus Harrison made it clear that Elkins’ push for the Cabinet had momentarily failed, not
                    because of factional complications or because he had failed to win Harrison's confidence
                    but because his West Virginia credentials were still too weak. Elkins would not go away empty
                    handed, however. "It is my hope," Harrison concluded, "that some of these
                    things may be accomodated [sic] in other ways. ..."85
                    On this ambiguous but encouraging note Elkins’ drive for office came to a temporary halt.
            As of inauguration day, 1889, the Davis-Elkins political combination had produced mixed results. The
                    tariff on coal was secure in the hands of Representative William McKinley and the Fifty-first
                    Congress. Harrison was in the White House. Davis was content to bask in reflected presidential glory
                    and to oversee Deer Park's blossoming as a summer capital. Elkins was still out in the
                    cold, however, and West Virginia still had two Democratic senators and no legally elected governor.
                    The mess at 
                        Charleston
                     continued to exercise a baneful influence over Elkins’ future. The Democrats
                    had managed to reelect Senator John E. Kenna over Goff by a single vote

                     after a month of balloting. But they were not yet ready to risk
                    their unstable majority on a solution to the gubernatorial quarrel. They appointed a legislative
                    committee to examine the returns; meanwhile the incumbent clung to his chair.86
                    With Democratic control of the state courts and militia there was little Goff's supporters
                    could do short of violence except wait out the Democratic maneuvers in the almost certain knowledge
                    that he would eventually be counted out. In these circumstances Goff became something of a national
                    partisan hero. When the Democrats, by further discreditable proceedings, managed to seat their
                    candidate in February, 1890, Goff became a popular feature on the Republican banquet circuit.87 With Republicans across the state and nation calling for his vindication it
                    became all but impossible to dislodge him in West Virginia until some appropriate means of
                    compensation became available. Harrison therefore found it advisable to delay the ultimate
                    recognition of Elkins’ demands indefinitely.
            However the President did not hesitate to make good on his promise to take care of Elkins
                    "in other ways." In supporting the latter's struggle for the West
                    Virginia leadership he stopped short only of moves that could be publicly interpreted as an affront
                    to Goff. During the first weeks of the administration Attorney General Miller promised Goff the
                    final say in West Virginia patronage,88 but Harrison promptly overrode him. The
                    first important local appointment made, that of district attorney, went to Elkins’
                    nominee. Goff and his friends presented another man, Harrison confided to Elkins, "but I
                    told them they were too late."89 Other West Virginia appointments
                    reflected Elkins’ influence, and even Davis took precedence over Goff when he extended
                    his protection over a Democratic officeholder whose place Goff wanted for one of his own followers.
                    Recognizing "the ex-Senator's kindly feeling toward our party in West 
                        Virginia
                    ," Secretary Windom informed Goff that it would not be "good
                    politics" to contravene his wishes.90
            
            Had Elkins been in a less desperate mood he might have been grateful for these omens of eventual
                    success. But his career had been stalled too long and his expectations aroused too sharply for
                    patience to prevail. He endured Harrison's first year in office with a

                     mounting sense of frustration. Shortly after the inauguration he
                    informed the President that the nature of his Cabinet appointments "has produced a chill
                    that is already felt, and it is feared will be followed with the same results that Hayes’
                    course brought about."91 When the administration encountered difficulty
                    securing the confirmation of Whitelaw Reid and Murat Halstead as ambassadors, Elkins traced the
                    problem to "several members of the Cabinet ... who are without experience in public
                    affairs. ..."92 "Many people think Harrison will have to look
                    out for Blaine in 1892," he remarked to Davis in August. "Had he stood by his
                    friends he would not have this to bother him." While Davis hosted the presidential
                    entourage during a two month visit to Deer Park in September, Elkins sulked in 
                        New York
                    . He feared the President was tiring of him, he said. In October he vented his injured
                    feelings to Davis in a discussion of whether there was any point in further representations to
                    Harrison. "Not a day passes that some leading Republican does not speak of his injustice to
                    me," he stated; Elkins thought that Davis himself should feel aggrieved. "Suppose
                    the case were reversed and as your good friend I had urged you to support a warm democratic personal
                    friend—& you did it in a way that could not be denied & all with his
                    knowledge & consent—then suppose after success, he refused to make proper
                    recognition. It seems to me I would resent such conduct & treatment, & signify my
                        displeasure."93 Davis’ reply to this outburst has not
                    been found, but apparently he was willing to be more patient.
            Another who counseled patience was Blaine. He warned Elkins that Harrison was "a man with
                    whom nothing is gained by argument or urgency at the wrong time." Blaine had sufficiently
                    roused himself to express regret to the President over Elkins’ absence from the Cabinet.
                    "His single reply was that residence alone stood in the way—alone was quite distinctly expressed."94 It is doubtful that
                    Elkins was entirely reassured by this information; he could do nothing to strenghten his geographic
                    position until Harrison found something to do with Goff. Blaine was convinced, however, that
                    Harrison would act when the time was ripe. Meanwhile he urged Elkins to do nothing that would lead
                    to an open breach with Goff in West 
                        Virginia
                    : "Away and beyond the present contest & of far greater importance, lie
                    two Senatorships," one for each of them. In the meantime Elkins should take steps to make
                    his residence in the Mountain State appear more plausible, like voting there is the 1890

            Either the counsel of patience had its effect on Elkins’ relations with the
                    administration, or Secretary Windom, thinking to oblige Elkins, got his wires crossed, for the
                    spring of 1890 saw a conciliatory gesture toward Goff—the appointment of his brother,
                    Charles J. Goff, as treasury agent in the Pribilof (Seal) Islands of

                    . This was a post of dubious appeal, it would seem, but one of Elkins’ many
                    speculative ventures, the North American Commercial Company, had extremely delicate business
                    arrangements pending in the islands. With Elkins’ help the firm had recently secured a
                    twenty year license on the Pribilof fur seal fishery. Elkins thus took a lively interest in Alaskan
                    matters, but whether he gave advance approval for young Goff's appointment cannot be
                        determined.96 His subsequent disapproval would figure prominently in the
                    denouement of his West Virginia campaign.
            In any event Elkins did not allow the opportunity to turn a profit on furs to distract him from his
                    quest for a Cabinet post. When a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court in December, 1890, he urged
                    Harrison to elevate Attorney General Miller, then to reshuffle his Cabinet to afford recognition to
                    those "known as Blaine men, but who became Harrison men and brought about your
                        nomination."97 The President ignored this advice, but Elkins
                    offered it again when Windom's death in January, 1891, created another vacancy. Elkins was
                    put forward by 
                        New York
                     and West Virginia politicians as Windom's successor, but he was not interested
                    in the time consuming Treasury post. Instead he wanted Harrison to transfer Secretary of War
                    Redfield Proctor and so create the vacancy he really desired.98 The least he
                    could do, Elkins informed the President, was to give the Treasury portfolio to Whitelaw Reid or
                    someone else among those "early friends who joined the cause when doubtful and helped to
                    make success certain."99 Harrison took this much of his advice when he
                    reached into the Blaine wing for the new secretary of the treasury, Charles W. Foster of 
                        Ohio
                    , an admirer of Elkins who helped to promote both his Alaskan adventure and his Cabinet
                        prospects.100
            
            Following Foster's appointment, Elkins requested an interview

                    "family dinner" on Sunday, March 8, 1891.101 What the two men
                    said over their cigars was apparently not recorded, but on the President's desk were two
                    items that must have greatly interested his guest. One was Secretary of the Interior John W.
                    Noble's resignation, which Harrison apparently declined to accept.102
                    The other was an act recently passed by Congress establishing the new circuit courts of appeal, with
                    one new judgeship in each of the nine federal circuits.103 At this point West 
                        Virginia
                    's interest in the new judge-ships centered on William P. Hubbard, the
                    candidate of the 
                        Wheeling
                     bar, and Edwin Maxwell, a state judge and Goff's former law partner. Goff
                    himself was uninterested in the post, and in any case Virginia Republicans were said to have the
                    inside track on the fourth circuit appointment.104 Elkins, however, had seized
                    on the judgeship as the means of disposing of Goff. He discussed the matter with Davis before seeing
                    Harrison and possibly also talked with C. B. Hart, who sent up a trial balloon bearing
                    Goff's name in the 
                        Wheeling
                    
                    Intelligencer on March 6.105 Harrison evidently did not commit
                    himself, but by the end of March "incoming West Virginians" at 
                        Washington
                     were stating with assurance that Goff was available for the appointment: "He
                    has been the Republican gubernatorial candidate in the State at great financial sacrifice and is
                    said to be quite willing to let some one else bear the brunt of future battles."106 There was no mistaking who that someone else might be, particularly after a
                    series of developments in April pointed toward the eventual fulfillment of Elkins’
                    ambition. On April 8 Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont announced his resignation from the Senate,
                    to take effect on November 1. Within a few days speculation had it that Secretary Proctor would
                    resign from the Cabinet to succeed Edmunds and that Elkins would take Proctor's place as
                    secretary of war.107 This is indeed what happened, although Edmunds’
                    timetable postponed the conclusion for several months. On April 30, however, with the dismissal of
                    Charles Goff from his post in 
                        Alaska
                    , the clouds parted to reveal once and for all the outcome of Elkins’ drive
                    for supremacy in West 
                        Virginia
                    .
            Behind young Goff's removal lay the sordid complications typical of such politico-economic
                    enterprises. Goff's predecessor as treasury agent, a pliant Democrat named George Tingle,

                     employ of Elkins’ company, had for years contradicted
                    the claim of conservationists that the 
                        Alaska
                     seals were in danger of extinction.108 On his arrival in the
                    Pribilofs Goff discovered that the opposite was true. The time had come, he stated in his 1891
                    report to Secretary Foster, "when ... imagination must cease and the truth be
                    told"; the herd was dangerously decimated and further killing should be halted if it were
                    to be saved.109 Foster's response was to fire Goff and replace him with
                    Joseph Stanley-
                        Brown
                    , an old friend of Elkins and Blaine, who—in the words of one irate
                    conservationist—"never saw a seal or knew what one looked like until he was sent
                    up there in 1891..."110 The administration later designated Stanley-
                        Brown
                     as a "seal expert" on the American delegation to the Bering Sea
                    Tribunal in 
                        Paris
                    .111
            
            The whole story of Elkins’ seal bonanza was not known at the time, but enough was known of
                    his interest in the matter to lend Charles Goff's dismissal the appearance of a direct
                    Goff-Elkins confrontation, from which the latter clearly emerged the victor. The significance of the
                    incident was not lost in West 
                        Virginia
                    . The 
                        Wheeling
                    
                    Intelligencer cautiously admitted its bearing on state politics and then left
                    further discussion to the Democrats.112 Elkins sought to conciliate his rival,
                    blaming the hubbub on the Democrats and disclaiming to Goff responsibility for his
                    brother's removal. Goff accepted the explanation although he has been warned long before by
                    friends in 
                        Alaska
                     of what to expect.113 Actually Goff had already seen the
                    handwriting on the wall and had determined to accept the judgeship if Harrison offered it; after his
                    exchange with Elkins and an interview with him in 
                        New York
                     in May, his availability took on the aspect of a campaign to secure the appointment, a
                    campaign that had Elkins’ vigorous support. Some of Goff's friends felt it was
                    wrong for him to abandon the field in West Virginia without a struggle. But he was tired of the
                    political wars, and when Harrison finally tendered the appointment, he opted for the dignity and
                    security of the bench.114 With him went all significant opposition to
                    Elkins’ leadership of West Virginia Republicans.115

            The outcome of the Goff-Elkins rivalry was foreseen as early as April, but in drawing events to a
                    conclusion Harrison exploited all his talent for irritating delays—"conscious
                    non-action" as one irate Republican senator described it.116 The
                    President dawdled nine months and then nominated only six of the nine judges Congress had expected
                    to take office on January I.117 Eventually Harrison sent Goff's name to
                    the Senate along with the others on December 16.118 As for the War Department,
                    Proctor's resignation was announced in August. Elkins shortly afterwards visited the
                    President at Cape May, 
                        New Jersey
                    , a move that most interpreted as clinching the matter.119 Still the
                    weeks rolled by and Harrison failed to act. Something of Elkins’ former anxiety returned
                    in November when Proctor's resignation took effect. At Elkins’ request, Russell
                    Harrison, Secretary Foster, and other insiders renewed the campaign of pressure on the President.120 Another month went by, however, before Harrison revealed his decision. He
                    sent Elkins’ name to the Senate on December 17, the day after Goff's nomination.
                    The new secretary was confirmed on December 22.121 It was three years to the day
                    since Davis had set out for 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1888.
            While the significance of Elkins’ appointment for West Virginia was well understood,
                    observers at the time were more interested in its implications for the coming presidential campaign.
                    By 1891 dissatisfaction with Harrison among party wheelhorses and workers across the country had
                    produced a much talked about movement to place Blaine at the head of the ticket in 1892. The
                    favorite interpretation of Elkins’ promotion saw it as part of a deal between Blaine and
                    the President: Harrison had named Elkins as a favor to Blaine in return for which Blaine agreed to
                    support the President's re-nomination. The story was attributed to Russell Harrison and had
                    it further that Elkins had resisted the President's call to the Cabinet until his
                    acceptance was approved by both Goff and Elaine.122 However, one observer, the

                    appointment, although he dutifully reported it. "They [Blaine and Elkins]

                     are still good friends," he observed, "but I
                    have strong grounds for the statement that Elkins is no longer the zealous adherent of Blaine that
                    he was a few years ago. ... Elkins’ acceptance of the place means that he will bend all
                    his energies to the renomination of Harrison. ... I mean the renomination of Harrison against
                    everybody, even Mr. Blaine himself."123
            
            The 
                        New York
                    
                    Herald correspondent was correct, as the events of 1892 showed. Evidence abounds
                    of Blaine's and Elkins’ continued friendship, but its earlier warmth had
                    inevitably cooled under the disappointment and frustration of each man.124
                    Blaine had contributed nothing but advice to Elkins’ drive for the Cabinet; as late as
                    August, 1891, he was still unwilling to intervene actively in Elkins’ behalf.125 Thus Elkins attained his goal less because of Blaine than despite him and
                    had every reason to cast his lot with the President without reference to Blaine's future
                    plans. That is precisely what he did. When Blaine formally disavowed his candidacy in February,
                    1892, most of his supporters continued as they had done in 1888 to work for his nomination.126 But Elkins took him at his word and threw himself into Harrison's
                    campaign for renomination. Indeed it was said to be Elkins who carried an ultimatum from Harrison to
                    Blaine in June, 1892, instructing him either to repudiate his supporters or to get out of the
                    Cabinet. Whether or not this was true, Blaine's resignation three days before the national
                    convention and the pathetic attempt of his supporters to carry the convention by storm found Elkins
                    "sorry for his [Blaine's] sake," but his loyalty to the President was
                        unshaken.127 The price of his loyalty had less to do with the presidency
                    that with West 
                        Virginia
                    . Elkins assumed unchallenged control of the state Republican party during the losing
                    campaign of 1892, and when the GOP finally turned the corner to victory two years later, he went on
                    to become the first Republican senator from West Virginia since Reconstruction.128 By building the most powerful political organization in the Mountain State's
                    brief history, he retained the seat until his death in 1911, becoming a charter member of the
                    Senate's Republican "Old Guard." Harrison had won a "strong and
                    valuable friend" in exchange for the mastery of a single state.

                  124 One revealing development was the disposition of Davis’ and
                        Elkins’ private patronage. In the spring of 1890 Emmons Blaine resigned his position
                        with the West Virginia Central Railroad after a dispute with the partners. Later the job was

            The Civil War Letters of Charles Harding Cox
            
                    Contributed by Mrs. Caroline Cox Wyatt*
               
                
            
                    Edited by Lorna Lutes Sylvester
                
            It was raining "pitchforks" in 
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , on
                    October 30, 1863, and Charles Harding Cox had "to perform a flank
                        movement" around the table in his tent to find a dry spot on which to write. But
                    Cox’ letter to his sister in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, contained the usual questions concerning political affairs at home, comments
                    about the fun he was missing in the Hoosier capital, and requests for photographs, much needed
                    clothing, and more frequent letters; it did not reflect the gloom and discomfort of the Civil War
                    camp of the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry to which Cox belonged. In fact it is in part
                    Cox’ exuberance which makes his letters somewhat unique amid the plethora of Civil War
                    manuscripts which have been published. The Hoosier soldier thoroughly enjoyed his wartime
                    experiences, whether he was guarding railroads, squiring pretty southern girls to parties, fighting
                    under Major General Joseph Hooker at Resaca, 
                        Georgia
                    , or marching with Major General William T. Sherman from 
                        Atlanta
                     to the sea.
            Cox’ letters to his family are typical of much Civil War correspondence: they refer to
                    such aspects of army life as infrequency of pay, mail delivery, inactivity, foraging, disease, lady
                    visitors from home, fraternization with residents of the southern states, and dissatisfaction with
                    drill, reviews, and inspections. Yet they are not routine recountings of battles and camp
                    activities. Perhaps because of his youth Cox retained throughout the war the initial enthusiasm
                    which most Hoosiers had for the conflict. The underlying excitement with which he approached all
                    experiences permeates his letters home and makes them a delightful and different commentary on a
                    soldier's life during the Civil War.
            Cox is typically Hoosier in many ways. His letters reveal an unshakeable faith in and loyalty to the
                    Union and a determination to restore that Union regardless of personal sacrifice. He does not like
                    Negroes. He frequently mentions his disgust for the blacks, and his comments leave no doubt that he
                    considered them inferior. Like most Indiana soldiers he was not fighting the war because of a moral
                    aversion

                        United States
                    . Patriotism does not obscure Cox’ interest in Hoosier politics. His comments
                    about partisan political battles at home denote his preference for the Republican party and a
                    belligerency toward the Democracy. And in few places are the political machinations involved in
                    military promotions more clearly revealed than in his letters to his brother-in-law, Frank B. Lord.
            Cox "grew up" during his three years of military service. His final letter on June
                    1, 1865, is far more mature and perspicuous than his first boyish announcement that he has
                    "gone for a soldier." Cox fell in love with the South while serving there. He
                    describes the Seventieth Indiana's camp near 
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , as
                    surrounded "on all sides by the finest country & scenery in the world."
                    Later he writes his sister during his stay in Gallatin, 
                        Tennessee
                    : "The weather is fine, and the climate and scenery around here is the most
                    pleasant & beautiful I ever saw ... and I ... have placed my land mark, upon which if luck
                    permits I am in hopes of some day ‘squatting.’ " Although Cox
                    sometimes complains that he has not received a letter from the "girl he left
                    behind," he also asserts: "If I ever intend to marry I shall most assuredly come
                    down to Tennessee for my Bride as there ... [are] more handsome looking young ladies ... than I ever
                    met before." In the years following the Civil War Cox realized both his wish for a southern
                    bride and his ambition for a home in the South.
            Cox joined the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer Infantry regiment in August, 1862, shortly before his
                    eighteenth birthday. The regiment, commanded by Colonel Benjamin Harrison—who later was
                    to become President of the 
                        United States
                    —and composed almost entirely of men from 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was officially mustered into service on August 12, 1862.1
                    Cox’ first duties with the Seventieth Indiana were those of company clerk and orderly
                    sergeant of Company E, which was commanded by Captain William M. Meredith.2
                    Shortly after its muster the regiment moved to 
                  Bowling
                        Green, Kentucky
               , where it was
                    assigned the "disagreeable, vexatious and inglorious work of guarding trains and chasing
                    the ubiquitous [Confederate Colonel John Hunt] Morgan," who was raiding throughout the
                    Bluegrass State in the fall of 1862.3 While on duty in Kentucky Cox was promoted
                    to sergeant major of Company E. In November the Seventieth Indiana marched to Gallatin, 
                        Tennessee
                    ; there it defended the 
                        Louisville
                     and

                        Murfreesboro
                    , and finally to 
                        Nashville
                    , where it was engaged in guarding trains to Stevenson, 
                        Chattanooga
                    , and other points and in picket and fatigue duty within 
                        Nashville
                    . While home on furlough in June, 1863, Cox was commissioned second lieutenant of
                    Company E but was not mustered into that position until he returned to the regiment. In 1864 as part
                    of the First Brigade, Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps, the Seventieth Indiana participated in
                    the 
                        Atlanta
                     campaign in 
                        Georgia
                    , being engaged in battles at Resaca, New Hope Church, Kenesaw Mountain, Peach Tree
                    Creek, and the siege of 
                        Atlanta
                    .4 At Resaca in May, 1864, the regiment led the assault on the
                    Confederate right, and Colonel Harrison, brigade commander, cited Cox in his official report:
                    "Lieut. C. H. Cox, acting adjutant, was conspicuous for his coolness and his efforts to
                    rally the men."5 Cox’ friend, Lieutenant Edward B.
                    Colestock, died of wounds received at Resaca, and Cox was commissioned first lieutenant of Company E
                    on July 1, 1864. Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton commissioned him captain of Company E in August,
                    1864, but he was never mustered into this position. After the fall of 
                        Atlanta
                     in September, 1864, the Seventieth Indiana marched with Sherman through 
                        Georgia
                     to Savannah, then northward through the Carolinas to 
                        Raleigh
                    . After General Robert E. Lee's surrender in April, 1865, the regiment moved to
                            
                  Richmond, Virginia
               , and on to 
                        Washington
                    , D. C., where it was mustered out of service on June 8, 1865.6
            
            Colonel Samuel Merrill's history of the Seventieth Indiana also mentions Cox’
                    bravery at the Battle of Peach Tree Creek in 1864: "Acting Adjutant Cox, beautiful as a
                    girl, brave as a lion, rushes through the left of the Illinois regiment to the hilltop, his form as
                    he reaches the crest outlined against the sky, waves his hat exultantly, and beckons a command
                    ‘Forward!’ for no voice could be heard in the uproar."7 Merrill says of Cox’ Company E: "A gayer lot of lads, with merriment
                    more contagious, never carried the colors."8 But a member of another
                    company describes E as a "rowdy company, made up at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , always taking the lead in everything questionable."9 And
                    the company's captain writes:

                        The company became the scapegoat of the regiment, and it was blamed for many an escapade of
                            which its members were not guilty; in which they had no share. The Captain of Company E
                            became ... ‘the regimental hell catcher’. ... If there was a
                            disturbance in any part of the camp, the Colonel, or the officer in command, would come
                            charging down or send the Adjutant to see what the devil was the matter in Company E. The
                            company next on the right, Company D, was a noisy company, and the one on the left, Company
                            F, was not an example of quietness, but E company had to catch it just the same; had to come
                            in for a good share of the blame for the noise and confusion, the fuss and the fun in other
                                companies.10
                  
                    Perhaps the antics of Company E in part explain Cox’ complete satisfaction with
                    army life.11
            
            When Cox joined the Seventieth Indiana in 1862, his family had been residents of 
                        Indianapolis
                     for approximately thirty years. His father, Charles, and two uncles, Jacob and David,
                    had immigrated to the Hoosier capital from Pennsylvania around 1833 and engaged in the manufacture
                    of tin and sheet iron ware and also dealt in stoves. Jacob Cox later gained prominence as an artist
                    and withdrew from the firm around 1863. Charles Cox continued to do business at the shop located on
                    West 
                        Washington
                     Street during and for many years after the Civil War.12
            
            Charles Harding Cox was born in 
                        Indianapolis
                     on December 12, 1844; his mother, Caroline Augusta Cox, died when Charles was not quite
                    two years old. His father later married Catharine Leila Fitter, the "Ma" to whom
                    Cox refers in his letters. Both before and after his military service he worked as a clerk and
                    bookkeeper in his father's business. After his discharge from the Seventieth Indiana in
                    1865 Charles returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where in October, 1866, he married Hulda Jones, also of the capital city. He and Hulda
                    had two children, Harry and Katie. The Coxes lived for a time in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , then moved to 
                  Decatur, Georgia
               , where Hulda died in 1882. After his wife's death
                    Cox went to 
                  Cincinnati, Ohio
               , and left his two children in the care of his sister,
                    Catharine Ward Cox (Mrs. Frank B.) Lord, four years his senior and the "Katie" to
                    whom most of his Civil War correspondence was written. In 1884 Cox returned to the South to
                            
                  Atlanta, Georgia
               , where he worked as an engraver and married

                        Carolina
               , and eventually back to Ball Ground, Cherokee County, 
                        Georgia
                    , in search of gold. Although Cox’ mining ventures apparently never proved
                    particularly profitable, the Coxes and their three children, Emma Caroline, Fred Ward, and George
                    Hays, remained in Ball Ground for a number of years. Cox was appointed postmaster of this city by
                    President William McKinley. In 1920 the family moved to 
                        Atlanta
                    , then to 
                  Marietta, Georgia
               , where Cox died in 1928. He was buried in the 
                        Marietta
                     National Cemetery.13

                    12, 1863. Most were written by Cox to his sister Katie and to his brother-in-law, Frank B. Lord, who
                    was associated with the 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                     Railroad. The Lords lived in both 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     while Cox was in the service, and letters were sent to them in both locations. The
                    remainder of Cox’ Civil War correspondence, that from January, 1864, to June, 1865, is

                                    full and 500 [have] been refused in the last few days. We expect to move in a few
                                    days. I think for the Army of the Potomac or for some school of Instructions east
                                    somewhere. I will send you a morning paper which contains a list of our company
                                    officers. Among which I have a slight one, besides I have been detailed into the
                                    Quartermaster's office, on extra duty, to write for him, with extra pay.3 I am exempt from Guard, and drill. Ma made me a very handsome
                                    present, this morning, it was an officers portfollio, and a toilet box. they were
                                    very nice. I received your kind letter yesterday, and am very sorry I have not time
                                    to write you a lenghty letter for I am very busy just now as the regiment is not
                                    fully equipped, but will be this week when I will have more time. We expect to move
                                    next week. It is said we have the best regt that has been raised in Indiana. Ben

                                            Spacing of headings, salutations, and closings has been standardized, but
                                            the punctuation originally used in these portions of the letters has been
                                            retained. Sentences added in the margins or crosshatched across the letters
                                            have been included after the closing. Cox seemingly used commas, periods,
                                            dashes, and equal signs interchangeably, whether at the end of or within
                                            sentences. Although an effort was made to determine Cox’ intent,
                                            complete consistency was impossible, and the editor has been somewhat
                                            arbitrary in transcribing commas and periods in an attempt to make the
                                            letters easier to read. Equal signs at the end of sentences and paragraphs
                                            have been changed to dashes. It was frequently impossible to ascertain
                                            whether Cox meant to use capitals or lower case letters, to begin new
                                            paragraphs, or to write certain words as two words or one, i.e., today or to
                                            day. In such instances the editor has attempted to conform to
                                            Cox’ intent or, when a decision could not be reached, has
                                            followed modern practice. Superior letters have been brought down to the
                                            line; flourishes and obviously unintentional repetitions have been omitted;
                                            incorrect spellings have been retained and have not been indicated by a
                                            [sic] or a correction, except for a few proper names and for words which
                                            might be misunderstood.

                        I write so frequently Katie Darling that I feel privileged to say but little on this
                                    occasion. I am now about to direct this to 
                                        Hanover
                                     on account of your certainty—as to your stay at the Pool and
                                    I feel that you will get it more readily.6 It contains very
                                    important news, that of your Brother joining the army. He begged so hard that we
                                    could not refuse him. Papa makes a great sacrifice in parting with him as he depends
                                    so much on him of late. You know he not only supports himself by his profession as
                                    he calls it, but is Papa's book keeper, collecter and general clerk. Allen

                                    situation for one so young he is Quartermasters clerk, as allso company clerk, but
                                    he does not have any hardship to endure he is exempt from guard duty and eats with
                                    the officers, and sleeps also with them, but he is kept busy at his books writing he
                                    was in camp yesterdy and says he enjoyed his dinner so much, nice
                                        chicken pie and desert and he could not think of any thing else, he sleeps
                                    at home until the regiment mooves I cannot tell when they will moove, but it is now
                                    full, and the Officers are nearly all elected8 There are more

                                            actually exceeded its quota of volunteers and thus no draft was needed in

                                    tired Did I tell you I sent Sarah away for her impudence to Aunt Anna. Well I have
                                    no one as yet to assist in my work, but will have one by the time you come to see
                                    me, so we can talk and walk to our hearts content. I told you in my last my Boy was
                                    going to get a shot at "Secesh" Now I must tell you he has gone.

                                    now the loved one of his company, and bids fair to be the favourite of the Regiment
                                    We did not know our Dear Boy until he was placed in a situation calculated to bring
                                    him out. As soon as he joined the Company, he was made Company Clerk, had the Books
                                    to keep and all soldiers names recorded, he was kept writing the greater part of the
                                    day. He was then made Quartermaster's Clerk, with additional pay, befor the
                                    Regiment left he was made ordinance sergent. That is to give out the guns and such
                                    stores to the regiment, and went off in that capacity, he is now one of the staff,
                                    but has a promise of somthing higher in a short time He was in great demand, every
                                    body wanted him at the same moment, he has made me fair promises, and I know he will
                                    keep them When he was going, he says ‘Never Mind Ma’. You
                                    shall never regret the step I have taken, and I believe him, he will never dishoner

                        My dear Sister!
                        Your kind letter came enclosed in one from home, on last Saturday, which were the
                                    first I have received since I have left for the wars. Our regiment is very nicely
                                    situated here at present, we have a pretty camp, and a fine set of men. it is
                                    pronounced by all the finest looking regt that has ever left Indiana, the 11th is
                                    nowhere. The streets thro camp on both sides, have been planted [with] fine large
                                    cedar trees, taken from the top of a hill on which we are encamped, and makes the
                                    camp look beautiful.
                        What I have seen so far of soldiers life, suits me very well, of course there are
                                    some privations and hardships, but when you get used to it, you are as much at home
                                    in camp as any where else.
                        I should have been very happy to have seen you before I left, but we were called away
                                    so suddenly that it would have been impossible. There are a good many folks from
                                    Ind'polis here visiting which helps make our camp in livelieness. I suppose
                                    you are aware before this that I have been appointed "Sergeant
                                    Major," of this regiment, one of the nicest positions in the reg. I would
                                    rather have it than 2nd Lieut although the pay does not amount to so much. All I
                                    have to do is to detail Pickets and Guards and keep the regimental
                                    books. Most of my bussiness is with the Adjt who is one of the finest men I ever
                                    saw, his name is James L 
                                        Mitchell
                                    , a friend of Franks.

                        My dear Sister!
                        We just returned this morning from an expedition up to 
                                        Elizabethtown
                                    , Mumfordsville [Munfordville] &c, [Ky.] after John Morgan, who
                                    has been up there burning bridges &c, but he is too well mounted for
                                    infantry to capture. Our Regt has been up to Mumfordsville for a couple of days, as
                                    they were expecting an attack there, but yesterday noon hearing Morgan had burned a
                                    bridge just 50 miles this side of 
                                        Louisville
                                     on the L & N. R.R. we were ordered up there, but he had fled
                                    before we reached the place, and as he was mounted it was useless to pursue. So we
                                    returned to Mumfordsville last evening, and as the rebels had burned the bridge over
                                    Green River several weeks ago, we unloaded the men, forded the river and returned to 
                                        Bowling Green
                                     on another train this morning, after being gone 3 days, on a wild goose
                                    chase, after J Morgan, but I tell you we were glad to get back to 
                                        Bowling Green
                                    , and get something to eat, and somewhere to sleep. We have been here so
                                    long that this place seems like home. I dont suppose there is a spot in Kentucky
                                    within 50 miles of 
                                        Bowling Green
                                    , that the 70th Ind has not been, for they keep us on the move all the
                                        time.20

                                        participated in a number of skirmishes in and around 
                                 Russellville, Kentucky
                              , while they were stationed at

                                    yesterday noon while at Mumfordsville, (and in the fortifications where our Ind boys
                                    fought so well and had to surrender to Bragg several weeks ago), 21 they came along with the first mail we have reed since Sept 10, just think,
                                    we were 6 weeks with out a paper or a word from home. I also reed two letters from
                                    home, but the latest of them was dated Oct 5th we are expecting another mail through
                                    this afternoon when we hope to hear later from home &c. We have gone into
                                        winter quarters here, and the Adjt and I have our tent fixed
                                    up in fine style and as comfortable, as most any house, we have a tight floor bed
                                    stead, mattresses, stove, writing desk, stools &c &c. You should see
                                    us, we have with the exception of Col Harrison, the finest and best quarters in the
                                    regt.
                        I do not think there is anything at all I need at present, and am much obliged to
                                    you, for your offer to attend to my wants.
                        You will excuse me from writing at lenght today, as I have written so much my hand is
                                    perfectly lame. Our regt is in fine health and I suppose it is the best drilled and
                                    disciplined reg that has left Ind.
                        Have they drafted any in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                     any person I know. I have just written home. All the news I can write
                                    about I suppose you read in the papers every day. I will write a few lines to Frank
                                    this week. Remember me to all enquiring friends. I am in fine health and really
                                    enjoy the life of a soldier. In my next I will give you a description of camp life
                                    in the 70th if I think of it. So good bye.

                                    this morning being at leisure, I will have to inform you we are still in the land of the living, and have gone for a soldier, and am enjoying the pleasures, hardships &c of
                                    one. Our regiment has been kept on the move ever since we have been here, running
                                    around the country after guerrillas &c, and there is very very few spots in
                                    this part of Kentucky that we have not scoured. Col Bruce has commanded the forces
                                    stationed here, but he does not amount to much, and he is not at all in favor with
                                    the men of the 70th Gen Rosecrans army is here now, reorganizing and preparing for
                                    the move south. Our regiment intends joining in with them, and going along, we are
                                    going into Daumonts Division and will probably leave in a few days.22 The road is expected to be open through to 
                                        Nashville
                                     in a week or so. If our regt winters here we will be put guarding this
                                    railroad and the regiment divided, but if we go along with the army we will have to
                                    leave at least 150 sick here, and at least 1/3 will get sick along the road. So you
                                    see it is a pretty hard choice, whether stay or go, but the "Field and
                                    Staff" have concluded to go, and we will have to leave all the comforts, we
                                    have collected here, and probably not see a tent again for a month. It is pretty
                                    hard for us to leave this place, as we have been here so long, it seems like home,
                                    besides we have our quarters fixed so comfortable for winter, it seems a shame to
                                    leave them, to tag along with this army.
                        We have not seen a paymaster since we have been here, and are all dead broke. I have
                                    not seen a red for 6 weeks.23 We muster for pay every 2 months
                                    but thats all the good it does. Frank! I wish you would loan me a few dollars until
                                    Uncle Sam sends his money bags around this way. I send to you instead of home,
                                    because they have sent me so many things that I do not feel like sending there. We
                                    are all in fine health, the Lieut Col and Adjt send thier kindest regards, but as I
                                    am not in a humor for writing this morning you will excuse me from writing any news.

                        Your welcome letter of Nov 19th was reed just this morning, after a two weeks
                                    journey.
                        We left 
                                        Bowling Green
                                     for Scottsville on the evening of Nov 10th we footed it through in 2
                                    days, being 25 miles, we remained at S[cottsville] (the most miserable hole in all
                                    Ky) until the morn of the 25 when we again took up the line of march for this place,
                                    (33 miles.) the first day we marched 20 miles, which stiffened the boys legs, so
                                    much, that they were scarcely able to swing them the next morning,
                                    but on we had to go and we arrived here at 3 P.M. on the 26th.
                        The boys are over thier tire [dness] now, and ready to be on the move again,
                                    notwithstanding we are now camped on one of the most bueatiful grounds to be found
                                    anywhere, and is named after my "pard" the Adjt, (Jim) who well
                                    deserves it.
                        We expect to leave here this week. I think for 
                                        Lebanon
                                    , Tenn, although probably we shall go to 
                                        Nashville
                                    . We are not only 3 miles from the 
                                        Cumberland
                                     River, which we will have to cross if we strike for 
                                        Lebanon
                                    , the heavy rains we have had for the past few days, has swollen the
                                    river so much, that it is not fordable, which will give our Bridge
                                        builders an opportunity of showing thier skill.
                        The train due here from 
                                        Nashville
                                     3 hours ago has not arrived, and it is feared it has been captured by
                                    rebel guerrillas, or that a bridge has been burnt detaining it
                                    about 200 rebel cavalry came within one mile of our pickets last night, as all our
                                    cavalry were absent on a foraging expedition, they were allowed to escape, it is
                                    rumored to day that a large rebel force was advancing on this place, so the forces
                                    here are kept constantly on the alert. Genl Thomas is in command here.24 I suppose there are 20,000 troops here. Our Regt has been assigned to

                                    are better clothed, as well fed, and as contented, and in as good spirits, as any Regt we have come
                                    in contact with. Lt Col and Jim are all O.K. and send regards to you. It is probable
                                    that Col Harrison will be put in command of a Brigade before long, as he is the ranking Col in the division, if he is, Jim will
                                    be appointed on his Staff, and I will no doubt, get some position under him. There is some talk of our being paid off before
                                    long, but the rumor is so old, that I do not believe it. Tell
                                    Katie it is not my turn to write as I have already written two,
                                    without an answer, but will write again at the first opportunity. My health is good,

                        My dear Sister,
                        Your kind and long looked for letter of Nov 30th arrived only a few minutes ago. I
                                    intended writing you to-day anyhow, enquiring the cause of your delay. I wrote to
                                    Frank several days ago, has he reed it.
                        When we arrived here we expected to stay only a day or so, but here
                                    we are yet, with no knowledge of when, or where we are going, this is one of the
                                    most Secesh places we have been yet, every one is a rebel, and it is a positive fact
                                    not one Union man have I seen or heard of. This is one of the most bueatiful
                                    countries, we have seen, since our departure from the Hoosier State, although war has shown its ravages in many places. Gallatin which at one
                                    time was a bueatiful and prosperous place, is now almost deserted and bussiness
                                    entirely suspended, with the merchants the only bussiness done at all, is by such
                                    men as Jews, Sutlers, Sharks, &c, who sell thier articles at scandalous
                                    prices, to such as have to buy. The Field & Staff had an Oyster supper last
                                    evening The Oysters we had, were of the first lot brought into Tennessee this
                                    season, it was quite a treat to us, and we went into them with a will.
                        There are some very large plantations around here, there is one of 2000 acres about 2
                                    miles from here, which has 250 slaves on it. I never saw so many niggers in a huddle before. Over 75 of them were less than 8 years old. I
                                    could not turn around without tumbling over some little nigger,
                                    who were laying around loose, playing in the dirt.
                        Yesterday we had a nice warm spring day. we could hardly think we were in the midst
                                    of winter, but today we can say winter is upon us, for we have quite a lively snow
                                    storm this morning, and in about 3 hours we had 4 inches of snow, and the boys are
                                    having thier fun, snow balling. I now have a nice warm fire in our tent, the first
                                    one since our arrival here, as it has been so warm. I have not reed a letter from
                                    home since Mr

                                     came, although I have written to Ma 5 or 6 times. I suppose that long one she wrote is to do a month or so, but I am looking for
                                    another one in the morning.
                        
                        We receive the mail regularly every day while here, also the 
                                        Louisville
                                     papers the day of thier publication. We shall probably stay here some
                                    time although it is uncertain. Gallatin is on the L & N RR, 159 miles from 
                                        Louisville
                                     and 26 from 
                                        Nashville
                                    . Our Regt worked on the fortifications yesterday, which are being built
                                    along the rail road and depot at this place. 8 or 10 freight trains run each way
                                    daily from L[ouisville] to 
                                        Nashville
                                     also a passenger and express train. We are encamped within 50 yds of
                                    the railroad and the passing trains produce about the only excitement, in camp now
                                    days.
                        Those men who deserted this Regt. have mostly been caught, a number
                                    are here undergoing a court martial, and I think thier sentences will all be, to
                                    work out the balance of thier enlistment in the Government prison, with a ball and
                                    chain to thier leg, and not a cents pay.
                        We are looking for Capt Scott this evening25 he will bring 8 or
                                    10 more deserters back, to be Court Martialed & suffer punishment as thier
                                    crime deserves. My health is first rate, and the health of the regt improving.
                                    Katie! I want you to write to me oftner, I shall excuse your past negligence.
                        Remember me to Frank, and all acquaintances. Direct to me at Gallatin until you hear of our being elsewhere. With much love I remain Your affect
                                    Brother.

                        My dear Sister!
                        I recd last evening your kind letter of the 12th, and was very glad to see that you
                                    are becoming more prompt in your correspondence, and hope you will keep it up, and
                                    write to me often, at least once a week, it will be very little trouble to you, and
                                    a great source of pleasure to me to hear from you frequently.
                        I suppose you have heard of our regiment being in the railroad
                                    bussiness. well! it is so. We did not contract the job ourselves, but were forced to
                                    guard this Railroad from Gallatin to 
                                        Nashville
                                     26 miles, 
                              
                                 25 Henry M. Scott of 
                                                Indianapolis
                                             was captain of Company A of the Seventieth Indiana. Terrell,
                                                Report of the Adjutant General, II, 641.
                           
                                     against the will and wishes of all the officers
                                    and men. the Regt is scattered at 5 different bridges, from one to four companies at
                                    a bridge.26 Col Harrison is doing all in his power to have us
                                    reunited again, whereby we may enter the field and stand some
                                    chance for distinction, as it is glory can never
                                    be won or never has been, guarding "railroad
                                    bridges," and unless we are speedily brought together again I am afraid the
                                    70th has "played her hand."
                        
                        We have 4 companies here at Hd Qrs, and I must say we have the prettiest camp in the
                                    state of 
                                        Tennessee
                                    , it is 15 miles above 
                                        Nashville
                                     on the banks of a bueatiful stream, called "Drakes
                                    Creek" which affords plenty of good water, and sport,
                                    Fishing, besides we are in the midst of the wood and surrounded on all sides by the
                                    finest country & scenery in the world, the houses throughout the country are
                                    large and handsome, and the owners are invariably Secesh. they
                                    show us no favors at all, call us d—n Yankees, and are out
                                        spoken rebels of the worst kind, but we forage all we want from them, which
                                    makes them pay dear for thier whistle.
                        
                        We are kept in a constant state of alarm as the country is full of guerrillas, and a
                                    large rebel force is on the opposite side of the 
                                        Cumberland
                                     River which is only 2 miles from here, and now while the river is low
                                    and fordable we have to keep a sharp look out.
                        We have felled trees all around our camp forming an abatis through which no cavalry
                                    force can get, and which makes us secure from a cavalry charge, and the pickets
                                    which we have posted out, relieves us of all fears of being surprised.
                        There happens to be a water tank at the bridge here, where all trains stop for water,
                                    through which we are enabled to get daily the 
                                        Louisville
                                     & 
                                        Nashville
                                     papers and occasionally a Cin'ti paper.
                        As far as I am individually concerned, the dividing and scattering
                                    of our regiment along this railroad suits my style, it gives Jim
                                    and myself not a thing to do all day long, except on our own hook,
                                    and I am afraid if it remains so very long, we will become lazy, we have very little
                                    to read, and amuse ourselves principly with music. I have plenty of time for writing
                                    letters, but as we are away out here in the woods, it is with difficulty we can find
                                    any thing else than the stir of camp life to write about.
                        General Dumont having resigned on account of feeble health, our regiment and Brigade
                                    was assigned to Genl Paine's division, he is

                                            posted along the

                                            was engaged in this duty until February 9, 1863. Ibid.,

                                            "Companies A, B, C, and D were located at Drake's Creek; E

                        My dear Sister!
                        In a mammoth mail which was reed by the 70th this evening, (being
                                    about the only one we have had since the Holidays) was your kind letter, also one
                                    from home, both written Jan 16th. In answering I can but freely forgive all past
                                    delinquencies on your part, in consideration of your doing better in future. I also
                                    beg pardon for my neglecting to write you, when having plenty of
                                    time and no excuse whatever, but its no use to cry over the past, and I hope our
                                    correspondence will be uninterrupted after this.
                        The nice "Christmas dinners" which were sent us from home, arrived
                                    at Gallatin via 
                                        Nashville
                                     this evening, we shall get them tomorrow. My "box"
                                    must be a "sight to behold" by this time, but as you say the canned fruit will be all O.K. and will be enjoyed as much
                                    "under the circumstances" as if tho I could had all.
                        I was surprised to learn of Joe Stretchers being married so soon. Through what I have
                                    heard of her intended, he seems to be quite a worthless fellow,
                                    but hope he will make her a good husband, and she

                        Ma! in her letter says! all my young lady acquaintences are or will be married before
                                    my return. I can only say "go in", there are more pretty girls in
                                    this neighborhood than I ever saw before. Jim and I are invited out very often to
                                    spend the evening and have fine times. We were out last evening & took our
                                    instruments. I could soldier this way for ever, but I am in hopes of finding some
                                    kind friend on my return to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    , who will pilot me around and introduce me to a few of the new Hoosier
                                    girls, who should then chance to be.
                        Charlie Judson has written asking Jim to stand with him at his marriage, on March
                                    11th, but I do not think he can obtain leave.
                        Col Harrison is now at home on bussiness for the Regt. I could have gone home for a
                                    short time last week, if I had a mind to escort some rebel prisoners as far as 
                                        Louisville
                                    , but I did not like the bussiness. Lieut Ohr took the job and is now at
                                        home.28
                        
                        We are expecting to be ordered back to Gallatin before long, to be stationed there,
                                    but we much prefer staying where we are, as we have a healthy pleasant camp,
                                    comfortable quarters, plenty to eat & nothing to do, while Gallatin is one
                                    vast Hospital & of course very unhealthy, 2000 sick are at present there.
                        I go in every few days to make my reports, to Brig Hd Qrs.
                        After 2 weeks hard winter, spring has now opened, and the weather is really fine, the
                                    wheat is up and we look for the trees to blossom in a few days. We are encamped in a
                                        Sugar Grove, the boys have tapped all the trees, and we get
                                    all the Sugar Water we want, which conies very handy as the Govt has not furnished
                                    us any sugar for some time.
                        But, Katie it is getting late, I shall close, hoping to hear from you immediately on
                                    the receipt of this and with much love to all.

                        Dear Frank!
                        Being at leisure this morning, which is nothing new to me since we have been guarding
                                    this infernal Railroad, I shall write you a short epistle of the doings of the 70th
                                    in this wooden country.
                        
                           
                              28 Lieutenant Martin L. Ohr of 
                                            Indianapolis
                                         served In Company A of the Seventieth Indiana. Terrell, Report of the Adjutant General, II, 641.
                        
                        
                        We dont know whether to grumble or be thankful at being placed guarding these RR
                                    bridges. We have five bridges under our care between Gallatin and 
                                        Nashville
                                    . Four companies are stationed here at Hd Qrs four above and two below.
                                    We are having an easier time than ever before, a beautiful camping ground, plenty to
                                    eat, nothing to do and any amount of handsome young ladies in the vicinity, but are
                                    not satisfied altogether, we are anxious to go to the front and
                                    endure the hardships and privations, and share the honor of our brother soldiers who
                                    have been standing the blunt of battles.
                        Not that there is no glory to be had guarding bridges, for we are
                                    continually under greater excitement and more danger and manifest more care
                                    & watchfulness than if we were in a large army. We have no block house at this post, but each of the other posts have one. they are
                                    built of Sweet Gum logs (2 feet in diameter) in this shape [hand drawn figure] the
                                    logs are stood on ends about 12 feet high, the enclosure will accommodate 100 men
                                    and have 20 loop holes on each side.
                        One good company can hold it against any odds, until starved out. We have our camp
                                    surrounded by breast works and are perfectly secure against any charge of the enemy.
                        We have impressed about 25 fine horses which we use for scouting, a squad of us went
                                    out yesterday and captured 1 rebel Lt. Colonel 1 Surgeon 1 Capt and 1 private, they
                                    were an ornery looking set, we "took them in" about 12 miles from
                                    here, and sent them to Gallatin last evening to be turned over to the Provost
                                    Marshall there.
                        Four hundred rebel cavalry were encamped 7 miles up the creek, from here, last week,
                                    we were about to go for them when they skedaddled, they are trying thier best to cut the road again along here, but
                                    they will never do it while the 70th is around.
                        The Indiana Legislature has been playing thunder generally ever since meeting, the
                                    rebels here are highly tickled with thier proceedings, they are a meaner set of
                                    traitors than the rebs themselves, but you take care of such men at home and we will
                                    provide for them here.29
                        
                        We are looking for a pay master along, some time this month, that is! we are merely
                                    "looking", we have not yet had a red, and a few
                                    green backs will make our eyes water.30
                        
                        
                           
                              29 The Indiana General Assembly which convened on January
                                        8, 1863, was composed of a majority of Democrats in both houses. Bickering
                                        between the Democratic legislators and Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton and
                                        the Republican minority constituted most of the session. Democrats termed their
                                        opponents "tyrants and usurpers"; Republicans responded with
                                        accusations of treason. Democratic attempts to curb the power of Governor Morton
                                        resulted in his assuming financial control of the state government without
                                        legislative sanction. Brevier Legislative Reports (1863), VI,

                        My dear Sister
                        Having received your very kind letter of the 9th inst last evening, I answer
                                    immediately although being so busy getting up "Special Orders" to
                                    be read on Dress Parade this evening, I have but little time to write.
                        Our Regt is together once more, we marched in yesterday from our country residance to
                                    the city, leaving about 100 men along the railroad. We are now encamped about a mile
                                    north of Gallatin in the woods near the Sumner Co Fair Grounds, it is the prettiest
                                    camp we have had yet, just far enough from town to make it pleasant, we shall
                                    probably remain here 6 or 8 weeks, our whole Brigade is now here, consisting of the
                                    102, and 105

                        The mail is now running very regular we receive our mail every evening. I received 2

                                    "grand" wedding and the many parties, and the fine times they all
                                    were having—If I ever intend to marry I shall most assuredly come down to
                                    Tennessee for my Bride as there were more handsome looking young ladies in the
                                    vicinity of our last camp on "Drakes Creek" than I ever met
                                    before.
                        Katie! we have only 2 years and 6 months of our time yet to serve, but the time will
                                    quickly fly away and the experience we shall have gained soldiering will be of great
                                    value to us. I can see no chance of obtaining a furlough and make a short visit
                                    home, but shall en-devour to be at home to spend 4th of July—

                                        9, 1863, and remained there until June 1, 1863, doing provost and picket duty.

                                        OF FEBRUARY 13, 1863.
                        
                        
                        Jim has been unwell for some time, and is not at present with us. We left him at a
                                    private house in Saundersville, but will join us in a few days. I am now acting
                                    Adjutant and am kept pretty busy since the Regt is together again, having both his
                                    and my own duties to perform.
                        Our career as railroad guards was tended with a great deal more danger than you may
                                    suppose, or than being in the front, as we were scattered in small
                                    squads in a strong secesh country, where guerrilla bands were thick as hail, and the
                                    citizens would aid them against us at any moment, but luckily we escaped any contact
                                    with them, except some small skirmishes which our scouts had—
                        Our Quartermaster is issuing new clothes to the boys to day, which helps the
                                    appearance of the Regt a thousand o/o. Ma sent me a pair of high topped military
                                    boots and a shirt which completes my wardrobe and I shall not want for anything for
                                    some time—
                        Spring has now opened here and things in general are looking
                                    "green", the boys are becoming affected with the
                                    "fever", but are kept on duty and drilling most of the time very
                                    much against thier will.
                        I have very little to write that would interest you so beg be excused for the
                                    shortness of my letters.
                        I have no objections whatever in your sending my Phot[ograph] to the young lady that
                                    asked for it, and wish you would send me the photographs of Frank and your self if
                                    you have any. Ma sent me hers the other day.
                        My health is good—But I close with much love to Frank and yourself hoping
                                    to hear from you soon I remain

                                    Feb 23d 1863—
                                
                        My dear Sister—
                        Katie!
                        Just recd your kind letter of the 20th and answer immediately, being at leisure and
                                    wishing to be punctual in answering your letters.
                        I reed a letter from Ma written the 19th, merely stating the change in bussiness
                                    affairs at home, but giving no particulars. I am exceedingly anxious to hear how
                                    matters stand and should like to be home to assist Father in starting anew in
                                    bussiness.
                        I should be very glad to see Frank in with him, being confident  they together could build up a fine trade in the Iron
                                    line, being both expert and correct bussiness men.32
                        
                        In my last speaking of things being "green" in this region, I
                                    forgot to mention that "green things" like you sent are very scarce, but we expect to be flush with
                                    "green backs" after our next muster on the 28th
                                    February—
                        Col Harrison has been in command of our Brigade for the past two weeks, by reason of
                                    Genl Paine being ill, turned the command of the post over to Genl Ward and Genl Ward
                                    the command of the Brigade over to Col H. I have been assigned a position on Col
                                    H's staff, and am now detached from my Regiment. We have our Head Quarters
                                    in one of the finest residences in Gallatin, and are living in fine style. But Paine
                                    is almost well and will resume command some time this week, much to our
                                    disappointment as we should like to command a Brigade all the time, but I much
                                    prefer being in camp, as I feel almost lost living in a house again, after 7 months
                                    with nothing but tents over us.
                        The rebels are building pontoon bridges over the 
                                        Cumberland
                                     about 40 miles above here they intend crossing in force and giving us a
                                        brush. We have been waiting 2 days for a couple of gunboats up
                                    here from 
                                        Nashville
                                    , we intend loading part of one Brig on them, and go up the River to
                                    stop thier proceedings
                        Katie! I should like to write you a lengthy interesting letter, but things in general
                                    are so dull here, it would be impossible.
                        The weather is fine, and the climate and scenery around here is the most pleasant
                                    & beautiful I ever saw, it far excels that around 
                                        Murfreesboro
                                    ’ and I in like manner with the gentleman you spoke of, have
                                    placed my land mark, upon which if luck permits I am in hopes of some day
                                    "squatting".
                        Our scouts continue daily to bring to these Hd. Qrs. large numbers of rebel soldiers,
                                    whom they capture in this vicinity. They are a miserable looking set of humans, long
                                    haired, poorly clothed, filthy 
                              
                                 32 In 1863 when Charles H. Cox’ uncle,
                                            Jacob Cox, withdrew from the tin and sheet iron business in which he had
                                            been engaged with his brothers, Charles’ father reorganized the
                                            firm. A foundry was built on South Delaware Street and was apparently named
                                            the Hoosier State Foundry and Stone Works. Partners in the new business were
                                            Charles Cox, Charles H. Cox’ father, Prank B. Lord, his
                                            brother-in-law, and a man whose last name was Peck. This may have been E. J.

                        Katie!
                        My dear Sister!
                        This being Sunday and as I answer most of my letters on that day, your last of the
                                    11th inst will be answered first and foremost of all, which are due from me and to
                                    be answered by me to-day.
                        It being such a common thing in persons writing letters, to speak
                                    of the weather, &c, that I try to say as little as possible—but
                                    writing from the "sunny south" where we
                                    "Northerners" think there is one continual streak of sunshine and warmth,—a few remarks might be beneficial to
                                    your mistaken ideas. The winter here is short "but sweet", and
                                    comes during February and the last of Jan. when it was
                                    
                              
                                 33 Republicans repeatedly accused the Democratic
                                            majority in the Indiana legislature of treason and southern sympathies.
                                            Similar legislative problems in other northern states as well as alleged
                                            traitorous activities of so called secret societies such as the Knights of
                                            the Golden Circle and Sons of Liberty brought fears—real or
                                            imaginary—of possible rebellion in the North. For a complete

                                     cold at all! it was
                                    "awful" cold, with several falls of snow from 2 to 5 inches deep.
                                    At present it is very pleasant spring has opened and a pic-nic in some of these
                                    beautiful groves would not go bad,—the only trouble
                                    with all this fine weather is the rain which we have every third
                                    day, and the hardest rains I ever saw, from morning till night without interval,
                                    which makes the mud knee deep, and every think [sic] is dead until it dries up,
                                    which the sun can do in about half a day.
                        Resolutions were drawn up and adopted by our Regt last Thursday, they being the sense

                        A lot of our scouts were captured and paroled last week, they were out scouting about
                                    25 miles from here, and were surrounded and "taken in" by about
                                    150 guerrillas, thier horses, guns, clothing &c were taken from them and
                                    they set loose, with paroles which do not bind them, as prisoners
                                    have to be regularly exchanged or paroled either at

                         a flood of remarkably similar memorials and resolutions poured into 
                            Indianapolis
                         vilifying the "traitorous" Democratic General Assembly of 1863.
                        The petitions demanded that the legislators cease partisan quarreling and support the war
                        unqualifiedly or Hoosier troops would return from the front to put down rebellion at home. See,
                        for example, 
                            Indianapolis
                        
                        Daily Journal, January 9, 16, 17, 26, February 3, 7, 12, 13, 1863. Democrats
                        claimed that the petitions did not represent the majority opinion of the regiments and/or that
                        Governor Oliver P. Morton had solicited the resolutions. For a discussion of these memorials and
                        petitions and their effect on Indiana politics see Sylvester, "Oliver P. Morton and
                        Hoosier Politics," 187–91. The petition of the Seventieth Indiana was
                        published in the 
                            Indianapolis
                        
                        Daily Journal on March 20, 1863. It warned troublemakers at home that
                        "all attempts of political conspirators in the North to alienate portions of the
                        country now standing firmly by the Government, and sending their sons together to die in its
                        defense, are as treasonable as the armed efforts of the South to destroy the Government, and
                        deserve the same execration at the hands of loyal men. ..."
               
                  35 "Franking" originally meant affixing a signature to a
                        letter, package, or telegram so that it might be exempt from charge for postage. In the 
                            United States
                         the franking privilege was abolished in 1873 but was in great measure restored a
                        few years later.

                        My dear Katie,
                        I just received your welcome missive of the 24th inst, and as it is raining very hard
                                    & I nothing to do, and "punctual" my motto, hear goes an
                                    apology for an answer from your "sojer boy" brother. My last two
                                    letters home were short uninteresting affairs, as usual. My abilities as a letter
                                    writer are limited, as you know I was always a miserable hand at telling the news,
                                    but as all my letters are of the same stripe I hope you will not retaliate by
                                    answering in the same style.
                        I have been reading all day a novel "Lady Audley's secret"
                                    and pronounce it fine, if you are at a loss for something to read try "Lady
                                    Audley's Secret" and I am sure you will enjoy it. We have so
                                    little to read here that I have read the Regulations through most a dozen times.36
                        
                        Col Burgess left for home last Tuesday I had an opportunity to go as far as 
                                        Louisville
                                     with him and could have run over to Ind'polis for a few days,
                                    but I was so busy at the time drawing up depositions, writing muster-out rolls
                                    &c and my stay home would be so short, I concluded not to go. but I shall
                                    try (not promise) [to] be to see you by 4th July. Tom 
                                        Campbell
                                     just came into my tent, and told me that Otis and West had been beat
                                    for their respective offices at the recent nomination. I should have been glad for
                                    Geo to [have] been successful, as he always seems to have been an unlucky person.37
                        
                        There is as much interest manifested in the regiment by those from
                                    Ind'polis, as to the nominations, elections &c at home, as there is
                                    among those in the city itself.
                        The title of the new firm Cox, Lord and Peck seems very appropriate, and my wishes
                                    for thier success, as I can lend no help to the institution. I should like
                                    exceedingly well, to be home just at this time, not that I am tired soldiering, or
                                    am homesick, but that I express as much interest in bussiness at home, as I do in my
                                    present situation. I am confident this war will not last more than 12 months longer,
                                    the rebs are "playing out" fast in the south. Rosecrans will have
                                    a lively skirmish before long, and it will be the fight of the season,

                        Dear Frank!
                        Have been intending writing you for some time but circumstances prevented. I am glad
                                    to hear you have associated yourself with the firm of Cox Lord and Peck, and should
                                    like very much to be home myself to have a hand in the muss, but the good time is
                                    coming and I am in hopes a few months may find me lending a helping hand to the
                                    institution. I see occasionaly in the [
                                        Indianapolis

                                    new firm, and hope in short notice you may be in full trim and good running order,
                                    eclipse all your opponents, and wish you all the success imaginable.
                        Col Burgess arrived at the Regt this afternoon and received the most hearty welcome
                                    that could be given, the boys seeing him coming made a rush for him, and as soon as
                                    he entered the guard lines he was taken from his horse and the boys carried him on
                                    their shoulders to his quarters, they were so glad to see him that they sent up cheer after cheer in welcome.
                                    He is the idol of the Regt. and a kinder hearted man cannot be
                                    found, he is sociable and his rank does not stick him up, and when
                                    off duty is a ringleader for the boys in their sports.
                        He speaks very highly of you and is a gentleman and soldier. Many thanks to you for
                                    those splendid cigars you sent, they are quite a treat, along side the
                                    "Half Spanish" our sutler sells. We were paid off last week up to
                                    the 28th Feb. I drew $140. only, it took $60 to pay my debts
                                    and I sent home $50. It is pretty tough 21 a month. I
                                    do not aspire to a higher position but hope before the war is over, to obtain
                                    something better if there are to be any promotions in my line, by good behaviour and
                                    meritorious conduct. My present position is one of no little consequence. I fare as
                                    well as any officer in the Regt and have a good time generally, the whole bussiness of the Regt devolves on me, and not to brag
                                        on myself, I know more of the doings, bussiness &c of this Regt
                                    than any man in it. Jim is as good a man  as I
                                    want any thing to do with, and treats me as a brother, but leaves the whole
                                    bussiness of the "adjutants office" to my care. I cannot write you
                                    any news from this quarter as the Telegraph comes in so far ahead, we are daily
                                    expecting an order to march to front, to help Rosey [Major General William S.
                                    Rosecrans] in his next fight, but no more, as I must write several letters yet to

                                    may find leisure enough to write me a few lines.

                        Dear sister Katie!
                        Your letter of the 4th & 6th came to hand a few minutes ago. I was very glad
                                    to hear from you as I had been looking for your letter several days. I did not get
                                    Ma's letter acknowledging the receipt of the Lithograph I sent. I have lost
                                    a great many letters lately, from my numerous correspondants, but they will a [11]
                                    come to hand some day, as they are miscarried and go to the front, or 
                                        Nashville
                                     where they lay in the hands of some negligent Postmaster until he sees
                                    fit to send them to the Regt.
                        I am glad the Foundry is progressing so nice, and that the new firm are so pleased
                                    with their enterprise, hoping this war may soon close, when I may be permitted to
                                    assist them in some capacity or other.
                        Col Burgess, Maj Vance and Maj Reagan (our Surg) all arrived to the Regt this week
                                    after a few weeks sojourn in the North. They report the
                                    "Butternuts" have greatly subsided and that
                                    things are going on smoothly again at home, which is welcome news for those in the
                                        field.38 I hope rebellion at home may never again come to
                                    such an alarming extent, but if it should happen and the Union men
                                    at home cannot attend to them, a few regiments which have been down in
                                    "Dixie," attending to professed rebels, should be called home and
                                        they would be dried up immediately. I hope
                                    we may never be called back on such a mission, but if it is necessary, we would willingly go and express to such scoundrels by ball & powder the sentiments of the Union soldiers.

                                     is fine and all in a bouyant spirit, the weather
                                    is fine and we are ready to strike out any place we are ordered.
                        The preparations Rosecrans is making indicates a forward movement.
                                    He has sent for all the Surgeons that can be spared at this Post, to attend to the
                                    sick and wounded who will be so unfortunate, to be so afflicted in the the coming
                                    engagement.
                        The 70th will anxiously await the result of the action or willingly
                                    take a hand in it, in the most approved style, as the "Hoosier
                                    boys" know well how to do.
                        I am glad to hear Father returned from his trip all safe and that his health is good,
                                    as well as all the rest. If you could enjoy the handsome weather we are having, you would think a person could live a thousand years and never

                        I should liked very much to have been home Easter sunday and seen the flub-dubs at church, we had quite a revival in camp on
                                    that day "Parson Goodwin" & our Chaplain conducted the
                                    exercises,—to a large audience seated on the ground and leaning up
                                    against trees—in the most approved foreign style.39 I believe I am about the only episcopalian in the Regt. and
                                    some pretty strong religious arguments occasionally arise. I have hard work
                                    batteling for my creed, but always hold my own. Maj Vance has
                                    tendered his Resignation and it will be accepted.40 all the rest

                        Dear Frank!
                        The mail is about ready to start and I shall write you but a few words. Major Vance
                                    has resigned been accepted and gone home. The aspirants for the

                                    . Merrill thinks because he is ranking Captain he is

                        The staff and 2/3 of the line officers have
                                    recommended Jim for the position. Col B is strong for Jim, and Col
                                    H rather favors him, but thinks he can not get around recommending Merrill without a

                                            the service as colonel of the One Hundred Thirty-Second Regiment. Terrell,

                                     general Muss, as promotion
                                    thus far have been made by rank in the 70th. Now Merrill is a good man, but Jim is
                                    by far the best of the two, Jim has a Commanding voice, is well drilled, has energy and is worshiped almost, by the entire Regiment, all of which Merrill is destitute of.
                        
                        And another thing if Jim gets the promotion your humble servant stands a fine chance
                                    to be Adjt, if the recommendation of the officers will be of any avail. My only draw back will be my age. Col B and Adjt are the only ones who
                                    have talked to me about it and will go their length for me.
                        Now you are a friend of Buck Terrills and have some influence over him, will you
                                    please see him and do your best for Jim and if the time should come also stick a
                                    word in for me.41
                        
                        Jim asked me to write you on the subject and if you can do any thing for us, you will
                                    have our ever lasting thanks.
                        Please do not say a word about this at home, as it is so uncertain, and if
                                    disappointed they will be none the wiser. I have a good pleasant position now and if
                                    disappointed, I will be none the worse off, only in pay. Col B is
                                    very ill has an attack of the pneumonia not dangerously. All the rest are O.K. Jim
                                    and Col Jim send respects to you. My health is good, will write again if any thing
                                    more transpires.

                        My dear Katie!
                        Your kind letter came to hand, I should have answered sooner, but my time has been so
                                    taken up with my duties, it was next to impossible, but this being a day of rest
                                    (although observed but little in the army) I cannot let it pass without writing and
                                    answering your kind favor.
                        You are all doubtless aware that the valise, jacket &c, arrived all O.K. are
                                    as nice as a pin and give entire satisfaction. We had a grand review at this post on
                                    yesterday afternoon, the troops reviewed were the (8th Brig) 70th Ind, 79th

                                    "melting" and the marching severe, which was inclined to make it a
                                    "bore" to us soldiers. Gallatin is quite lively with ladies from

                                    scorching sun. she says you were going to call and see her before she left, but
                                    failed to do so, but I cannot see what that has to do with my letter. The key and Ma's letter, arrived all safe, the key fits and
                                    Mas letter remains unanswered I shall answer my first opportunity. Am reading
                                    "Les Miserables" by Victor Hugo, think its fine, never was better
                                    pleased with anything.43
                        
                        I am glad they are progressing so well with the Foundry, should
                                    like to be there to assist, but am contented soldiering if it does not last "over 3 years". Saw a Mans leg

                        The news from Jo Hooker is so "mixed" I hardly know what to say
                                    about the proceedings on the Potomac, am in hopes it will turn out favorable to us,
                                    and our career as soldier boys will be shortened.44 Katie I have
                                    several letters yet to write, and am in a monstrous hurry, which
                                    you will percieve in this case by this miserable writing, nothing new under the sun,
                                    everything in Dixie looks charming and I think we will spend a pleasant summer,
                                    soldiering in this region. I reed a letter from Frank at the same time yours came to

                              42 Harvey [or Hervey] Bates came to

                                         in 1822 and was associated with many of the capital city's
                                        first undertakings. Bates gained a substantial fortune as a result of his
                                        numerous business ventures. In 1852 he began construction of what became known
                                        as the Bates House, "one of the foremost hotels of its day."
                                        His son, Harvey Bates, Jr., was also important in commercial and civic affairs
                                        in

                        Yours of April—came to hand, no thing of interest has transpired or I
                                    should have answered sooner. Jim and I return our thanks for the interest you
                                    manifested in, and trying for our promotion. The matter has been
                                    settled and we are satisfied.46
                        
                        The 70th is still in the same camp we were 3 months ago, & such a nice place
                                    it is, we are indifferent as to whether we stay here till the summer is
                                    o'er or not, although it would not surprise us to be ordered to the front at any moment. The boys are gay and festive, happy as larks, but think it is most
                                        too warm in Dixie to agree with them, especially on Brigade or
                                    Bat drill. Just imagine the 8th Brig in the field, the 70th (ranking Regt) on the
                                    right, and the command "on the left by file into line," "double quick" march, the sun coming down like
                                    an oven of one of Cox, Lord & Peck's cooking stoves, the boys sweating and cursing, and you will have a faint
                                    idea of what soldiering is. but I need not complain as I have no drilling to do (or
                                    never do any) and have an easy time in that respect, but I can sympathize with those
                                    who are so afflicted!
                        I suppose you must think the 70th is in love with, or interested in
                                    the welfare of Gallatin, judging from our long continued residence
                                    here. I cant say whether it is the attraction of the place, or the numerous handsome
                                    young ladies to be found here, that makes me feel so contented in remaining here,
                                    but am inclined to think it is the latter.
                        
                        I see by the Journal that the Foundry is in "motion" and
                                    that—if all "turns up" well—R-L & Co
                                    will have to "open their winkers"
                           47 I should like exceedingly well to take a stroll through the shanty, and peep at what you are doing, send me card, circulars
                                    &c.
                        I write to the women folks at home every few days, to inform them
                                    that I am still in the land of the living. My health is good, am perfectly
                                    contented, getting along hugely, have got so used to this life, I
                                    think I am better contented than I would be at home, although a short visit there
                                    would be by no means disagreeable. Furloughs are now being issued

                        My dear Katie!
                        A few words to you to day in answer to yours of 20th May 1863. I have so little to
                                    communicate that would interest you, that I am almost ashamed to write. I am also
                                    far behind in my correspondence and wish some thing lively would happen that I might
                                    write about.
                        Col Harrison, Adjt Jim and 4 of our companies crossed the [
                                        Cumberland
                                    ] River this morning, intending to remain several days and scour the
                                    country in the direction of 
                                        Lebanon
                                    . A number of rebels (several hundred) are reported in that vicinity,
                                    and we are expecting hourly of news of a fight between our boys & them. I
                                    did not go this morning for reason that I was out on a scout with about 100 cavalry
                                    yesterday, was in the saddle all day, rode very hard and to day am nearly
                                    "played out".
                        I saw Vallandingham to day as he passed thro’ here on
                                    his way to join the "Southern Confed" he seemed to be enjoying his
                                    trip South very much, but I am afraid he will have the blues
                                    pretty badly by the time he steps out side our lines, he said while here that the
                                    people of Ohio intended nominating him for next Governor and that he expected to
                                    gain the election. He is mistaken there !48
                        
                        Mrs H is still here but, I think, expects to start for home in about a week, she
                                    remains in camp all day and seems to enjoy herself very much. Col
                                    Burgess’ family are also here, and are all very sick, the Col is very
                                    much distressed, he is afraid he will lose his little girl.
                        The news from Grant to day is very flattering. Rosecrans is
                                    advancing on Tullahoma and I am in hopes we will wind the rebels
                                    up in the West, so as we may be able to assist Hooker this summer.49
                        
                        
                           
                              48 Clement L. Vallandigham, an Ohio peace Democrat, was an
                                        opponent of President Abraham 
                                            Lincoln
                                        's administration, the war in general, the curtailment of
                                        civil liberties, arbitrary arrests, the draft, and other implementations of the
                                        conflict. He advocated an armistice with the South, immediate peace, states
                                        rights, and "The Constitution as it is; the Union as it was."
                                        He was arrested in May, 1863, for alleged violation of General Order Number 38
                                        issued by General Ambrose Burnside who commanded the Department of the Ohio and
                                        who declared he would not tolerate "the habit of declaring sympathy for
                                        the enemy" or permit "expressed or implied"
                                        treasonable conduct. Tried and convicted by a military commission, Vallandigham
                                        was exiled by 
                                            Lincoln
                                         to the Confederacy. The Ohio Democrat proved somewhat embarrassing
                                        to the Confederate government, which was relieved by his departure for 
                                            Canada
                                         in June, 1863, via a blockade runner. On June 11, 1863, the Ohio
                                        Democratic state convention nominated Vallandigham for governor. He was
                                        resoundingly defeated by Republican John Brough in the October election. Frank

                                        , federal authorities urged Major General Williams S. Rosecrans to
                                        undertake an offensive against the southern general to hold Confederate strength

                        Dear Katie!
                        I wrote to Ma about a week ago, "noticing" my arrival at the Regt
                                    and our move to this post. We have been expecting every day to strike tents and move
                                    across the river (Stone river) inside the fortifications, but on account of the
                                    incessant rains we have not moved yet, but think by tomorrow we will get into a
                                    permanent camp and live in a little better style than we do now. I thought at first
                                    that my present position would be an unpleasant one, as the aspirants would try to
                                    make it so, but they have all got over their excitement and everything goes on as
                                    smoothly as can be.50

                        Meade's victory in the east was a glorious affair. Rosecrans driving Bragg
                                    out of Tennessee was ditto, but the raid Morgan has made into Ky and destroyed the L
                                    & N R.R. again is not quite so glorious.53 I am writing
                                    this having no idea you will receive it for a month, as the mails have not been
                                    regular and the tearing up of the railroad will spoil our letter writing for some
                                    time. I reed the letter Ma sent back to me, but have not heard a word from any of
                                    you. I reed the ring Ma sent me by Capt Scott he gave it to me in 
                                        Cincinnati
                                    .
                        I reed my box all safe & sound and the cakes & peaches were quite a

                        We expected to be paid off the first of July. I am afraid it will be some time yet as
                                    the paymasters will not risk their money over the L & N R.R. so long as
                                    Morgan is any wheres near it.
                        The weather is here is warmer than any I ever experienced, the sun comes down in
                                    regular "Dixie style" the Thermometer averages 110° in
                                    the shade. I have almost melted several times but by close confinement to my tent I
                                    am still alive. The inhabitants here say the month of August is 1/4 warmer than this
                                    month. I expect (or rather hope) by that time the 70th will be moving

                        If all the news we have heard today proves true, I think 1864 will find us back home
                                    again.
                        It was lucky I reed my furlough when I did as no more have been issued since and the
                                    system has been dried up. My health is good am getting fleshy

                        Dear Sister!
                        I received by mornings mail yours of 17th inst and as I had read 
                              
                                 53 General George G. Meade assumed command of the Army
                                            of Potomac two days before the Union victory at the Battle of 
                                                Gettysburg
                                            , July 1–3, 1863. On June 30, 1863, at the close of
                                            the Tullahoma campaign Major General William S. Rosecrans forced Confederate
                                            General Braxton Bragg to retreat across the Tennessee River, thus turning
                                            him out of his positions in 
                                                Tennessee
                                            . Early in June, 1863, Bragg authorized John Hunt Morgan to
                                            undertake a raid into 
                                                Kentucky
                                            —moving wherever he chose—in order to slow
                                            Rosecrans’ advance toward 
                                                Chattanooga
                                            . After several encounters with federal forces between July 2
                                            and 9, Morgan, against Bragg's orders, crossed the Ohio
                                                River into Indiana. His raid into the Hoosier State and on
                                            into 
                                                Ohio
                                            , though exciting, was unsuccessful, and Morgan was eventually
                                            captured. Ibid., 851, 539, 568–69.
                           
                                     but one letter from home since leaving, it came
                                    with extra pleasure. I wrote to Ma on last Sunday, hope she will get it. I have
                                    written to her 3 times since arriving at the Regt.
                        If the people of 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     are leaving to seek a colder clime I wonder what they would think of
                                    the warm weather if they were down here in Dixie. I never saw it half so hot at
                                    Ind'polis. it bothered us exceedingly at first but we are getting used to
                                    it, and are becoming quite attached to the Southern climate, at least
                                        we might as well be, ie while the war lasts. I cannot grumble that our
                                    nights are warm for they are bitter cold. I had to sleep last night with two heavy blankets over me. The coldness of the
                                    nights has no inducement for the Musquitoes and bugs to hunt their abodes but
                                    besiege us by thousands and torment unmercifully the entire night. I never passed
                                    such an awful night in my life as night before last while on Picket in the woods. I thought I would be literally eaten to
                                    pieces before morning by Musquitoes, gnats &c.
                        Col Harrison assumed temporary command of our Brigade this morning.
                                    Genl Ward has gone to 
                                        Nashville
                                     and will probably go home on a furlough (if he can get one) which I
                                    hope he can and will go home and stay, it would be for the
                                    "good of the service" if he should. He is the ranking Brigadier in this Dept, but by his incompetency, has been continually
                                    kept in the rear, and never assigned a responsible command. I wish the 70th was in another brigade, for we will never see a fight while under him. Genl James D Morgan releived Granger from command of this post this
                                        morning.54 Morgans Brigade arrived here on yesterday, and
                                        I will not be the least surprised if we are ordered back to 
                                        Nashville
                                     in less than 10 days. Confound such a General as Ward!

                                    H's staff. Genl Wards staff officers have been assigned to the Col, they
                                    being idle.
                        I was requested to act Adjt of the regt during Mitchells absence,
                                    but declined for the reason, that I have been with my company so short a time, it would look as though I was disinterested in it by leaving so
                                    soon.
                        Col Harrisons Orderly—Jerry Barker (the boy Ma took such a fancy to) went
                                    outside the Pickets on July the 3d to hunt a horse which had broke loose and has
                                    never been heard of since, only that he 
                              
                                 54 At this time the Seventieth Indiana was attached to
                                            the Second Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General William T. Ward; Third
                                            Division, commanded by Brigadier General Robert S. Granger; Reserve Corps;

                                                Cumberland
                                            . Brigadier General James D. Morgan commanded the Second
                                            Division of the Reserve Corps. Since, according to the official records,
                                            Morgan did not replace Granger as commander of the Third Division,
                                            apparently the Second Division merely replaced the Third at the

                                    Jerry belonged to my company, he was too reckless and head strong, and I have

                        The excitement in this Dept during the past 8 weeks has been unusually quiet, not a
                                    single skirmish and hardly a picket fight, it seems as though it were "the

                        Katie! only this morning did your kind letter come to hand dated Aug 7th 1863, I was
                                    aware of your absence from home and your trip to

                                    . Ma! wrote me just after you left. I was sorry indeed to hear of her
                                    sickness hope she will soon recover. I have had but two letters from her since I was
                                    home. She used to write so often I miss her letters very much.
                        I just arrived at the Regt from a visit to 
                                        Nashville
                                     of several days. I had a very pleasant time while there and had my
                                    leave of absence been 2 days longer I would have gone to 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    .
                        My health is very good, but the general health of the Regt is worse than it has been
                                    since we have been in the service. Our present camp is a very unhealthy one. The
                                    continual breezes we get are direct from the battle field, and you can imagine how
                                    poisonous they are when I tell you of the thousand, dead bodies of men &
                                    animals to be found half buried in every direction.56
                        
                        Our army commenced moving at the front this week, and I think we will soon wind up
                                    affairs in this Dept. We expect to move from this post in a few days, I care not how
                                    soon, or where, I am anxious to be Moving.
                        
                           
                              55 According to Merrill's history of the
                                        Seventieth Indiana, Jerry Barker was captured by Confederate soldiers near the
                                        beginning of July, 1863. He escaped and returned to the regiment on August 6,
                                        1863, having bribed a guard with his "lady love's
                                        ring" in order to effect his escape. Merrill, Seventieth

                                    belonged to that Corps, as we did last fall. It would suit me exactly to make a trip

                        My dear Katie!
                        On my arrival at the Regt from a short trip down to 
                                        Alabama
                                     I was the happy recipient of yours of Aug 21st 63. At present writing I
                                    belong somewhat to the tired list having been on the go for the past 4 days, and just arrived back to camp. This letter will
                                    probably find you at home after I hope, a pleasant visit to 
                                        Hanover
                                    . It must be pleasant to spend the summer in a colder climate. How I
                                    wish we had a little snow from the White Mts to cool us down in this melting region. We have suffered very much from the heat
                                    this summer, but providence is now favoring us with a little cooler times, in fact
                                    the past 6 or 8 night [s] has been uncomfortably cool making double covering, fires
                                    and winter duds in demand.
                        I hear from Ma several days since will write her again in a few days. I saw a Nigger Brigade this morning at Estell springs, Tenn clothed and
                                    armed, they made a splendid appearance (for niggers) and will probably fight. I do not like the niggers, and desire to see them all "put away" our first opportunity. I do not
                                    believe it right to make soldiers of them and class & rank with our white soldiers. It makes them feel and act as our equals. I do
                                    despise them and the more I see of them, the more I am against the
                                    whole black crew.
                        I expect to hear of our forces occupying 
                                        Chattanooga
                                     in a day or two, the rebs are reported evacuating.57 We have been shelling the place, when I was in that region shells were
                                    flying in the city thick and fast. Since my trip to the front I am not quite so
                                    anxious to be thar, the excitement would suit me
                                    "muchly" but 
                                        Nashville
                                     suits me 
                              
                                 57 Following William S. Rosecrans’
                                            successful Tullahoma campaign, federal authorities hoped to capture 
                                                Chattanooga
                                            , a vital communications hub. Prom August until September, 1863,
                                            the northern forces concentrated on occupying the town—which they
                                            did early in September—and gaining possession of the upper
                                            Tennessee Valley. These maneuvers set the stage for the Battle of 
                                                Chickamauga
                                             which occurred September 19–20, 1863. Boatner, Civil War Dictionary, 151.
                           
                                     well enough. We are not
                                    gaining much honor here, but are having a splendid time and not much danger of
                                    getting shot, still we never think of that wherever we are. 
                                        Nashville
                                     is a tiptop place I have felt more at home here than any place we have
                                    been station, city life is my preference. I do not want to move until I am tired of
                                    the place. You will know when that comes to pass by my grumbling.
                                    I hope I will not be disappointed in my expectations about the war being over by
                                    1864 I want to get home and out of this soldier business.
                        I am getting along in my new posish finely, have no trouble at all, all work well.

                        My dear Ma!
                        I just came in from Battalion drill and to my joy your welcome letter met me on my
                                    arrival! I am sorry indeed to hear you are down again was in hopes you had fully
                                    recovered by this time and making a trip in 
                                        Ohio
                                    , still my prayer is your sickness may be short and once again enjoy the
                                    comforts of health. Maj Merrill arrived all safe bringing my sash
                                    which was beautiful indeed. I will have an opportunity of wearing it this afternoon
                                    on a Grand Review of all the troops around this city. It will be a
                                    grand affair, eclipsing all 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     "doings" as a whole Division will be in the field.

                        I wrote to Katie at home last week as I expected she would be there by that time.
                                    Tell Father to write to me I would like to hear from him so much. I want to hear
                                    from the Foundry what they are doing, whether they expect to do much in the stove trade this fall & winter, and matters generally.
                        I am very much pleased at the Regt being stationed here. I like it better than any

                        Mary Stretcher is a great girl, she wanted me to write to her so much, which I did 6
                                    weeks ago and have never had an answer yet. Just tell her I am not so anxious to
                                    write to girls and get no answer and if she ever expects to hear from me again I
                                    shall requ[est] her to write me very soon begging my pardon &c for her
                                    delay.

                                    another drop during his connection with the service.
                        Col H still commands the Brigade and will continue to do so until Ward is relieved

                        Dear Frank!
                        You being somewhat of a "Military Man",59 I
                                    wish to lay a case before you, which has lately
                                    come to my knowledge, viz[:] You are well aware that I was commissioned 2nd Lieut Co
                                    "E" 70th Ind during my visit home, that I accepted the same and
                                    reported to my Regt and Company for duty in good faith. While at 
                                        Murfreesboro
                                    ’ I was unable to be mustered, as no Mustering
                                        officer was stationed there. On our arrival at 
                                        Nashville
                                     I neglected being mustered (or trying to be) until a short time since,
                                    when I found that the enclosed order (No 182) from War Dept had been issued which
                                    hit my case exactly by preventing me from being Mustered into the U. S. service as
                                    2nd Lt, as our company numbers only 75 men, and you will see that the order requires 80 men in an Infty Co to entitle it to a 2nd Lieut. By that
                                    operation I have been knocked out of near 3 months pay as Lieut,
                                    as I cannot draw pay until mustered and not be mustered until the
                                    rolls show 80 men or more. If I had reed my commission before June 20th/63 (date of
                                    order) I would have had no difficulty in getting mustered but I did not receive it
                                    until the 25th June. It is somewhat

                                     of a Dilemma, but Col H has
                                    determined to have me "fixed up" all O.K. and has made these two
                                    propositions
                        1st: A vacancy now exists in the 1st Lieutenancy of Co "F", he has
                                    offered me that position, if I will accept. I will rank higher,
                                    but think my present Co the preference of the two. I will have no trouble getting
                                    mustered in that position
                        2nd: He has offered to get an order for me to go home and Recruit
                                    enough men for our company to entitle me to be mustered. If I should come home I
                                    will do so immediately (in a week or so). I am dubious what to do. If I go into Co
                                    "F" I will rank as 1st Lieutenant ("something") and be in an equally as pleasant crowd as
                                    now, ie the commissioned officers, and my pay will commence the day I receive my
                                    commission as such. Should I go home to recruit I will loose a couple weeks more pay and never rank higher than 2nd Lt as my
                                    present Capt and 1st Lt will "stick till the last", but I would
                                    enjoy the pleasure of a trip home and be at an expense I am unable to stand on 21
                                    dollars a month should I come whats the prospect for 8 or 10 recruits (which is
                                    enough for my case) Write immediately what you and Father think I should best do. My
                                    health is good, fighting at the front

                        Since writing the above I have learned Col H has recommended me for
                                    1st Lt Co "F". I have concluded to send the above letter now as it
                                    is written.—it explains my situation
                        Frank, I want you to go to the Adjt Genls office and have the commish issued immediately and sent to me. My pay will not commence until I
                                    receive it in my own hands. Also please enquire if J. A
                                    Fitzgeralds commission as Asst Surg 70th Ind has been sent him,60 he is my own cousin and a private of my company, he has
                                    been recommended as asst Surgeon and I would like him to receive his commish as soon
                                    as possible. These matters are neglected at the Adjt Genls office unless some one
                                    stirs them up a little. By attending to this business for me at
                                    once you will greatly oblige.

                        I wrote you today countermanding my former letter about seeing
                                    after my commish, as 1st Lt in Co "F", since writing and mailing
                                    my letter, I noticed in Ind'polis Journal of the 15th inst that eleven (11)
                                    new Regiments are to be raised in Indiana, I was just talking to Adjt Jim and he requests that I apply for Adjutancy of one of
                                    them. Do you think it is possible and will you assist me. I can get the
                                    recommendation of the Field officers of the 70th and the Line officers if their
                                    names would do any good.

                                     is going to write Terrill about it tomorrow and will
                                    give me a good recommendation. As the Adjutant is one of the first Officers appointed in raising new Regts, the sooner an
                                    application is made the better. My experience in the Adjutants Dept of a Regt has
                                    been quite extensive and I feel competant to hold the position,
                                    as, I have conducted that dept in the 70th weeks at a time, during Mitchells
                                    absence. If I can get a commish as Adjt I will have no trouble to get mustered out
                                    of the 70th and return home immediately to accept it. Frank! as you have some
                                    influence around the Gov's office I will be under everlasting obligations
                                    if you will do your best in having me appointed and see about it immediately on
                                    receipt of this.
                        I send this by Tom

                        Dear Frank!
                        I have written you several letters during the past week giving a detail of my present
                                    situation, also asking your assistance in procuring me the position of Adjutant in
                                    one of the new Regts to be raised in Ind. Adjt 
                                        Mitchell
                                     has written Terrill about it asking his influence and
                                    Col Burgess sends a strong recommendation to the Gov, in the same
                                    mail with this, for my appointment.
                        I have not spoken to Col H about it as he is detached from the Regt on a Military Commission. I have not seen him for a week, but am confident he
                                    would cheerfully recommend me for the position. Col B is Comd'g the Regt
                                    and I think his recommendation is sufficient.
                        Now Frank! With your influence and the help Col B and Adjt have given me, I feel as
                                    though I could obtain the required place.
                        Give me all the assistance you can, by seeing the authorities &c, and I will
                                    return the favor.—As soon as the fighting is over at our front, I shall
                                        probably obtain leave to return home to recruit. If it is
                                    
                                    impossible for me to obtain an Adjutancy will you please try have
                                    a Commish issued me to return home to recruit for the new Regts I would rather recruit for one of them than the 70th. Write me
                                    soon what success, &c

                                    negligence was unavoidable. I reed a letter from Ma also this morning dated 19th,
                                    (yours was 22nd) it had been delayed on the road.
                        I sent a letter to Frank on day before yesterday, also a
                                    recommendation for me, to a position in a new Regt, was sent by the Col, to Gov
                                    M[orton] in the same mail. I am in hopes with Franks influence of obtaining the
                                    place wanted. I have no fears, but Frank will do his best for me.
                        You are doubtless aware of the severe fighting going on at our front, and are posted
                                    in all the particulars. Several thousand of our wounded have arrived here already
                                    and all that will bear transportation are to come.61 A great
                                    many of my acquaintances are amongst the killed and wounded. I noticed Col Chas
                                    Anderson of Cin'ti, here yesterday, wounded in the arm.
                        A large lot of Ind surgeons passed through here this week, a great many called out to
                                    see us. Gov Morton is first in everything, he is thought more of by the soldiers
                                    from all states than any man in the U. S.62
                        
                        I should like very much to be home to attend the fair [Indiana state fair, September
                                    29-October 5, 1863] this year, but so many of our officers are absent now and
                                    fighting in this Dept makes it useless

                                                Chickamauga
                                             on September 19–20, 1863, General William S.

                                            , and General Braxton Bragg laid siege. The skirmishes and
                                            battles which followed constituted the

                                 62 Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton early in the war
                                            established an elaborate system for supplying the needs of Hoosier soldiers
                                            and caring for the sick and wounded. The Indiana Sanitary Commission
                                            distributed clothing and sanitary stores, wrote letters for wounded
                                            soldiers, saw to the burial of the dead, kept registers of the names of
                                            Indiana soldiers in the various hospitals, etc. Following large battles
                                            corps of special surgeons were sent to the field to care for the Hoosier
                                            wounded. Such state activities of course proved a source of trouble for the 
                                                United States
                                             Sanitary Commission and caused much jealousy and
                                            dissatisfaction among soldiers of other states. Morton, however, relished
                                            his role as the "soldiers’ friend," and he was
                                            much revered for his activities in their behalf. Stampp, Indiana Politics during the Civil War, 123–27.
                           
                                     to apply for leave at present, even to recruit, we dont know how soon we may be ordered to
                                    the fight. The boys are very anxious to see a little of the elephant, and would jump for a chance to have the name of at least one battle inscribed on the flag, presented us by the ladies of 
                                        Indianapolis
                                    . 2/3 of our "Reserve Corps" was in the last fight and
                                    did excellent service.
                        If we had not had an old granny like Ward Comdg us our Brigade
                                    would now be mourning the loss of hundreds of our comrades.
                        I was at a large dancing party last evening and had a fine time indeed, the prettiest
                                    ladies of N [ashville] were there and I had a fine opportunity of witnessing
                                    southern style, the ladies here seem to choose their beaux amongst the army officers
                                    here in preference to the civilians. Col and Mrs Harrison are boarding in the city I
                                    never see them over once a week. The Col appears to be losing interest in the Regt
                                    since he has been detached. I guess he would like to exchange the [hand drawn eagle,
                                    designating colonel] for the [hand drawn star, designating brigadier general], it
                                    would better suit him.
                        It is very cold today, I have to wear my overcoat to keep comfortable. The boys are
                                    preparing winter Quarters as you must recollect they have no tents at all, all the
                                    shelter they have is a thin piece of cotton goods 5 ft square to
                                    each man, which he has to carry on a march. They dont do a particle of good in a

                                    company. If I have to stay here I am going to have Father make me a sheet iron stove
                                    for our tent. My health is excellent, my throat is almost well.

                                        short ropes attached to the corners to stakes in the ground. The patriots
                                        entered this dwelling on all fours. The single piece of muslin and a small
                                        oilcloth was carried by each man. ..." Merrill, Seventieth

                              64 When the Democratic majority in the Indiana General
                                        Assembly of 1863 attempted to curb Governor Oliver P. Morton's military

                        I wrote you on the 28th, also mailed the Gov a recommendation and request from Col
                                    Harrison that I be apptd Adjt in one of the new Regts. The Col
                                    also sent Wm Wallace Esq (county cl'k) a letter, requesting him to exert
                                    his influence in my behalf.65
                        
                        I could send a recm'd'n from every line officer
                                    in the 70th, but the Cols tell me it is useless and their recomdn
                                    is sufficient in a case like this. If it were not so late I would
                                    do it anyhow, but it would take two days to see them all, as 1/2
                                    are away from camp at a time, on duty, and stay 48 hours before returning, which
                                    would make it a week before it could reach Ind'polis. Col Hs and Bs
                                    recommendations were so very "strong", we all
                                    think they will suffice. I hope so at least.
                        Many thanks to you, for the interest you manifest in my welfare,
                                    should we succeed or not.

                        My dear Sister!
                        Your very kind letter was reed together with one from Ma on Sunday last, I answered
                                    Ma's letter and now a few lines to you.
                        We have had quite a hub-bub in camp the past few days, as a cavalry force (rebel) of
                                    some 10,000 are in this vicinity and we have 
                              legislators bolted the legislative halls, leaving the assembly with no
                                            quorum to do business. Since no appropriations bill had been passed for the
                                            succeeding biennium, Democrats expected Morton to call a special session in
                                            which they could continue their partisan efforts. Instead, the governor
                                            appointed a financial secretary, set up his own treasury, and proceeded to
                                            secure funds by various means to run the state for the following two years.
                                            While Morton negotiated for money with which to pay the interest on the
                                            state debt, Democrats kept up a constant barrage of criticisms and warning
                                            that a special session of the legislature must be called. The governor
                                            refused to heed their threats and administered the financial affairs of the
                                            state without legislative approval until the Republican dominated General
                                            Assembly of 1865 sanctioned his actions. Both Morton's and the
                                            Democracy's behavior reached the depths of partisan politics during
                                            these months of bickering. For a complete discussion of these events see

                                            of the Eleventh Corps, Army of the Potomac, early in 1863 because of ill

                                    here and they could strike a more severe blow to our army at this point than

                        This is a gloomy day in camp, a hard rain and cold wind, our tents are old and much
                                    worn, poor shelter in a storm. In the absence of a stove, we built a chimney to our
                                    tent, which does so well, I am almost predjudiced against a stove. Just imagine 3 of
                                    us in a tent 9 by 10, our bed, desk, valises, chest and a host of other traps, not much room to stir around, but we are in a palace, to what our

                        My dear Sister.
                        Yesterday evening yours of the 12th inst was reed by your little brother. Not being
                                    in camp but little now days, it is impossible for me to write often. I am in the
                                    railroad business again, running as Military Conductor and comdg train guard between
                                    here and the Tenn river in 
                                        Alabama
                                    , 123 miles. The trip is a very pleasant one, crossing the Cumb
                                    Mountains 100 miles below here and through a tunnel a mile in length, quite
                                    exciteing business as hardly a train passes without being fired into, or the track
                                    torn up or a bridge burnt. We are some times 5 or 6 days making the trip. Rosecrans
                                    whole supplies are carried over this road, which keeps at least 20 trains
                                    continually running.
                        I am glad to hear Frank is still trying for a
                                    "posish" for me, and verily hope he may succeed69 I have had 3 or 4 letters from Ma since she has been in 
                                        Salem
                                    , she appears to be enjoying the trip hugely and it will be some time before she will return. I must write her this morning as her
                                    last two letters are remaining unanswered. Katie! I have lost one of my young lady
                                    correspondents in the shape of Miss Jones, probably she has got
                                    married, as that disease appears to prevail amongst my fair correspondents, as only three have entered into the "holy bonds"
                                    since I have been in the service, but more likely I am
                                    "aus-ka-speil" as "soldier clothes" are getting
                                        too common, still I am not void of correspondents amongst the

                                            a promotion in the Seventieth Indiana at this time. Apparently, however, the
                                            dilemma relating to his muster as second lieutenant of Company E, Seventieth

                        My dear Sister!
                        Not being in camp for near two weeks long enough to snatch a minute to write you,
                                    until to day—you will excuse my silence. This is a gloomy day in camp,
                                    raining "pitchforks" and our tent being rather aged and worn it
                                    does not afford much shelter against the storm, making it necessary for me to
                                    perform a flank movement around my table occasionally to get a dry
                                    spot to write on. I am continually on the lookout for a letter from you and expect
                                    before this hardly gets dry yours will come to hand. It has been two weeks since
                                    Ma's last was received. I shall write her again today. She told me her
                                    secret do you know it yet, if not I shall not tell you, you will learn it soon
                                    enough.
                        Your visitors have doubtless come & gone. What progress do you make at being

                        My dear Sister;
                        Both letters of yours and Ma's written the 7th inst came to hand by this
                                    mornings mail. Not half an hour after I had written to Ma on Sunday last, I was
                                    taken sick with fever, and sore throat and I have been confined to my tent ever
                                    since. My fever has entirely disappeared, but my throat is still quite sore though
                                    rapidly improveing. It has been with the utmost difficulty that I could swallow the
                                    least particle of food and my appetite is greatly increasing as my throat gets
                                    better.
                        While writing this Maj Gen Hunter is making a tour of Inspection through our camp,74 about all we do now days in camp is preparing for Reviews,
                                    Inspections &c. Keeping the boys continually cleaning their guns, policeing
                                    quarters, streets &c and cleaning up their clothes. It is a good thing to
                                    make the men keep them selves and clothes clean and neat and the camp in good order,
                                    but "too much of a good thing becomes a bore" so with the 70th. It
                                    has required some labour but our Regt is now in better condition than ever before.
                        
                           
                              73 Cox is probably referring to a Sibley tent, a bell

                                        tent, equipped with a stove, the pipe of which passed through an opening in the
                                        apex, was designed for the accommodation of approximately one dozen men, but it
                                        frequently housed twenty or more. The men arranged themselves for sleeping in

                        Rumours are prevalent throughout our Brigade that we are to be ordered to

                                    . We are all eager for the move and are willing to make any change, as
                                    we have seen enough of 
                                        Nashville
                                     to last us during the war. Still we are not tired of it and only desire
                                    a change.
                        I have not seen Mrs Col Harrison yet as my sickness has prevented my calling.
                        I am glad you thought those phot[o]s good. Tell Ma I will send her two more in a few days, as I have ordered more to be taken.
                        The weather here has taken a change and it is quite mild this week. Every third day
                                    it rains and the other two it is clear and pleasant. I am well supplied with
                                    overcoats and clothing and only need a couple white shirts should

                                     is to be a grand affair from what I read of it, and the proceeds should

                                    the day after publication.
                        I have nothing strange to write to day. No news of any importance. I have no idea of
                                    another trip home until the close of the war as furlough's are
                                    "played out". I will write you at length when I get over my sick

                        I was somewhat surprised on yesterday when I received by mail an "Express

                                            December 21, 1863, through approximately January 5, 1864. Proceeds from the
                                            bazaars, auctions, donations, entertainment, etc., were to be used for the

                                     and myself.76 We have very
                                    fine eating (for the army) and plenty of it, though not so nice as to be had at home
                                    and are becoming quite aristocratic as we eat from

                        To-day is a miserable disagreeable rainy day and we are all confined to our tents,
                                    the camp very gloomy as is always the case on a rainy day. It is now 5 1/2P.M. and
                                    quite dark. Ed is out on Picket and Capt down in the company quarters playing
                                    chequers with the boys, I am alone in our tent, with a bright fire, writing at our
                                    desk, by the light of a star candle,77 and to tell all with a
                                        cigar in my mouth, to keep me company while I am writing to
                                    those I should like to be with, instead of here, still I am not homesick and only prefer the enjoyments of home rather than the army.
                        Our hero Maj Gen Grant is in the city at present and will remain several days. I have
                                    not had the honor of seeing the gentleman yet but will on Monday next as he reviews
                                    the troops at this post on that day, making the third review the 70th has
                                    participated in during one week.
                        You are doubtless aware through Katie's letter that I have
                                    been on the "Sick list" with fever but now have fully recovered
                                    and able for my rations. It is a nice thing for one to have his
                                    "big caz" a Surgeon in the Regt, for Dr F bestows extra attention
                                    to me when complaining.
                        A large collection of small "Haversacks" containing Thread, pins,
                                    Sewing Apparatus, Religious tracts &c were sent by the young ladies and
                                    little girls of Ind'polis to Chaplain Allen for distribution to the
                                    soldiers of the Regt, each bag contained a letter and some a photograph of the
                                    sender. I have seen several familiar faces and one sent to the Company was of Miss
                                    Sallie Habbard. The bag which I reed contained a letter, with an earnest appeal for
                                    the dear soldier whose receives it, to answer, not a very nice way
                                    to obtain correspondents but I think I shall answer, as I am well acquainted with
                                    her, and she had I am sure no idea it would fall into my hands.
                        I hear from Grand Cox occasionally, from the way he talks it appears he is the
                                    greatest business man in 
                                        Indianapolis
                                     and has to "steal time to attend to his correspondents. I
                                    wrote to Mary Stretcher some months ago (at her request) and have never reed an
                                    answer. I am not at all anxious to hear from her, but when you see her please ask
                                    her the reason she did not answer.

                        TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS MAY COME, GREETING:
                    
                    
                  WHEREAS, an understanding and appreciation of Indiana's history and
                        heritage are essential in order that Hoosiers may perform their responsibilities as voters and
                        citizens; and
                    
                  WHEREAS, the Indiana General Assembly in 1967 adopted a resolution asking
                        "That the month of April annually be declared Hoosier History and Heritage Month by
                        formal proclamation of the Governor"; and
                    
                  WHEREAS, it is important that students become aware of the democratic
                        achievements which have characterized state government since territorial days; and
                    
                  WHEREAS, from pioneer days to the present Indiana citizens have made many and
                        significant contributions to the cultural, scientific, economic, political, and religious life
                        of the state and nation; and
                    
                  WHEREAS, April is a particularly appropriate time of the year to visit
                        Indiana's scenic and historic places, its parks and natural areas, and to sponsor
                        programs and observances which encourage Hoosiers better to safeguard and preserve the reminders
                        of our rich legacy from pioneer times to the present;
                    
                  NOW, THEREFORE, I, Edgar D. Whitcomb, Governor of the State of Indiana, do
                        hereby proclaim the month of April, 1972 as 
                            HOOSIER HISTORY AND HERITAGE MONTH
                         in Indiana, and urge that during the month of April, schools, museums, historical
                        societies, libraries, women's clubs, civic groups, and other organizations make a
                        special effort to feature lectures, exhibits, pageants, tours, and other educational programs
                        which interpret Indiana's history and heritage. I further urge that Hoosiers augment
                        their efforts to protect the natural beauty of our State, to conserve our varied natural
                        resources and to reduce the pollution of our environment.

            Awards of Merit and Certificates of Commendation from American Association for State and Local
                    History
            All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and postmarked by not later than May 15, 1972. Each nominator must include a supporting letter
                    which is explicit in indicating why the award or certificate seems merited. Each nomnator is also
                    responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements directly to the state chairman. Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, and books. The views
                    and evaluations of various persons will be considered regarding each nomination.
            1. Certificate of Commendation. The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                    outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial, and
                    local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances rather
                    than on a basis of overall excellence in the 
                        United States
                     and 
                        Canada
                     as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                    which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area. The
                    certificate is a pat on the back and says to the individual or organization that receives it:
                    "We think you are doing a wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for
                    it."
            2. The Award of Merit. This was the original award of the American Association for
                    State and Local History and is still the backbone of its competition. It is given for excellence of
                    accomplishment or program in the field of state, provincial, and local history and is in no way
                    judged relative to local limiting circumstances. The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as
                    saying to everyone: "This is public acknowledgment by the American Association for State
                    and Local History that this accomplishment or this program, in comparison with all similar
                    accomplishments and programs in North America, deserves the adjective excellent."
            Nomination forms are available from Donald F. Carmony, Ballantine Hall 742, Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , Indiana 47401. Mr. Carmony is chairman for nominations from Indiana for 1972.

               Marquette's Explorations: The Narratives Reexamined. By Raphael N.
                    Hamilton, S. J. (
                        Madison
                    : The University of Wisconsin Press, 1970. Pp. xv, 275. Maps, notes, illustrations,
                    appendices, bibliography, index. $10.00.)
            Every schoolboy knows that Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit priest, accompanied fur trader Louis Jolliet
                    on the famous French expedition of "discovery" and exploration of the upper
                    Mississippi River Valley in 1673 and wrote a chronicle of their travels. But among scholars
                    (Catholic ecclesiastics at that) there is agreement only that Marquette did indeed make the historic
                    journey. Father Francis B. Steck, an ordained Franciscan, has argued that Marquette was not a member
                    of the Society of Jesus, that the narrative of the trip is actually Jolliet's duplicate
                    journal embellished by Claude Dablon (Superior of the New 
                        France
                     missions), and that Marquette has been accorded a greatly exaggerated role in the
                    expedition. According to Father Jean Delanglez the Récit was not based exclusively on
                    Jolliet's account but was fashioned by Dablon from a variety of contemporary sources.
                    Father Joseph C. Short has contended that Marquette was never ordained and thus confined his
                    missionary work to that of lay catechist. Such heresies have not gone unchallenged through the
                    years, but it has remained for Father Raphael N. Hamilton, himself a Jesuit and longtime student of
                    Marquette and the upper Mississippi frontier, to resolve the major points of contention.
            Much of the dispute stems from the quantity and quality of the historical record. The official log of
                    the trip and other firsthand reports were lost when Jolliet's canoe capsized; the surviving
                    evidence is scanty, vague, and at times contradictory. This is especially true of the lone extant
                    account of the expedition, the Récit traditionally attributed to Marquette. In order to
                    ascertain the authenticity and accuracy of the Récit and related documents, 
                        Hamilton
                     subjected every known piece of Marquette material to exacting internal and external
                    criticism, employing bibliotic and cartographic techniques in addition to rigorous content analysis.
                    The result is a work of impeccable scholarship that constitutes a resounding reaffirmation of
                    Marquette's renown as a Jesuit priest, explorer, and chronicler.
            Because of the nature of the problem at hand, Marquette's Explorations is
                    more a legal brief than an historical narrative. Specialists will find this fascinating piece of
                    detective work both entertaining and edifying, but the general reader will find it heavy going. This
                    narrowly focused and closely reasoned study assumes  much
                    familiarity with the competition among European powers for empire in North America, the intramural
                    rivalry between Jesuit and Recollect missionaries, the history of New 
                        France
                     under Jean Talon and Louis de Buade de Frontenac, and the structure and operation of
                    the Roman Catholic Church and the Jesuit Order. Although judicious English translations accompany
                    literal transcriptions of the original French and Latin, knowledge of seventeenth century French is
                    desirable since textual analysis is the warp and weft of 
                        Hamilton
                    's intricate scholarly tapestry. This reviewer's only substantive
                    criticism is the perhaps inevitable elevation by implication of Marquette to coequal status with
                    Jolliet when the fur trader was undoubtedly the prime mover of the pioneering enterprise. Be that as
                    it may, it is fitting that this impressive volume along with the recent biography of the
                    missionary-explorer by Father Joseph P. Donnelly assures Marquette of his rightful place in the
                    annals of history as the tercentenary of the French discovery of the Father of Waters approaches.

               Free Soil: The Election of 1848. By Joseph G. Rayback. (

            Joseph G. Rayback's Free Soil provides an excellent account of the
                    presidential politics leading up to the election of 1848, but it is much less successful in
                    explaining the politics of the free soil issue itself. Drawing upon a multiplicity of newspaper
                    sources to trace the development of the various careers of presidential candidates, Rayback is
                    especially good in describing the ebb and flow of their political fortunes and showing how even the
                    most ephemeral of occurrences can raise or dash political prospects. In the early summer of 1846 a
                    chance sentence in General Winfield Scott's correspondence with James K. Folk's
                    secretary of war apparently destroyed his candidacy. More significantly, the book makes clear that
                    it was Zachary Taylor's victory at 
                        Buena Vista
                     and the wild popular enthusiasm which it engendered, more than any political
                    consideration, that made him the Whig candidate in 1848.
            Rayback seems much less at home with the politics of the Democratic party, which was intimately
                    concerned with the issue of slavery in the territories in the period from 1846 to 1848. At one point
                    he confesses to being puzzled as to "why northern Democrats delayed so long in revealing
                    their [antislavery] attitude" (p. 60). Whatever their moral concern, politicians
                    infrequently take up an issue which  cannot be made to serve
                    their political interests, and in the 1840s the political interests of virtually all politicians,
                    Whig and Democrat alike, depended upon the maintenance of a party unity which the slavery issue
                    directly threatened. The issue emerged when an important faction of the Democratic party developed
                    interests which overrode its commitment to national party unity. Essentially it was the
                    Barnburners’ determination to use the slavery issue to advance their political fortunes,
                    coupled with the response which this evoked from John C. Calhoun and his southern Democratic
                    supporters, which precipitated the struggle over free soil.
            Rayback treats the Barnburners’ advocacy of the Wilmot Proviso as essentially an
                    idealistic enterprise. He maintains that "there was no evidence of an ulterior
                    motive" and goes on to say: "The Barnburners’ acceptance of the Proviso
                    was actually a logical result of their long-standing championship of the principles of freedom and
                    equality" (p. 298). The aim of their third party movement was "the advancement of
                    the principles of the Proviso" and not "the recovery of control of the party in 
                        New York
                    " which "had become secondary" (p. 298). Regaining control of
                    the party in 
                        New York
                     never became secondary to Martin Van Buren, as a careful reading of his correspondence
                    shows. This is not to say that Van Buren was not genuinely interested in free soil or that he was
                    unprincipled. But Van Buren was a politician par excellence, and he expressed his principles as a
                    politician does, by coordinating them with a drive for political power, in his case not his own but
                    his son's and that of his other close political associates.
            Rayback also misses the rhythm of the development of the free soil issue which flowed from the
                    efforts of the Democratic factions to advance their political interests. The issue emerged slowly
                    and then, after the Barnburners picked it up, developed as a series of dialectical exchanges between
                    the various factions, with the party regulars constantly seeking a synthesis which could accommodate
                    the different positions sufficiently to maintain party unity.
            Rayback apparently did not consult Walter L. Ferree's dissertation, "The 
                        New York
                     Democracy—Division and Reunion, 1847–1852," which
                    skillfully traces the role of Preston King and his Barnburner friends in thrusting the Wilmot
                    Proviso "firebrand" into politics. The author also mistakenly dates the appearance
                    of the idea that slavery could not exist in the territories without a positive law introducing it as
                    August, 1848. Actually this premise was as old as the Wilmot Proviso itself, having been advanced by
                    John 
                        Quincy
                     Adams on the same day that Wilmot introduced his amendment., It was specifically to
                    require the Democratic party to disavow popular sovereignty and the "positive law"
                    idea, as well as the Wilmot Proviso  that William Lowndes Yancey
                    introduced his Alabama Platform in February of 1848, not, as Rayback would have it, a year earlier
                    when these doctrines were undeveloped and posed no danger to the South. In his final chapter Rayback
                    describes the disintegration of the major parties which began in 1848, but one must look elsewhere
                    than in Free Soil for a complete explanation of this process.

               The Debate over Slavery: Stanley Elkins and His Critics. Edited by Ann J. Lane. (

                    paperbound, $2.95.)
            Stanley Elkins’ Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual
                        Life (1959) without question extended the examination of slavery into new areas, and, as
                    Charles Pinderhughes says, Elkins provided a "meaningful involvement of the reader in an
                    intellectual and emotional process which has obviously carried many readers far beyond the content
                    he makes explicit" (p. 104). But Elkins’ view that slavery was a closed society,
                    his use of the concentration camp as an analogy for understanding the effects of slavery on the
                    personality of the enslaved, and his assertion that "Sambo" was peculiar to the 
                        United States
                     have found several critics. Only Aileen Kraditor has challenged his attribution of an
                    anti-institutional bias to the abolitionists.
            The editor in her introduction adequately summarizes the major points Elkins made in his study and
                    briefly states the positions taken by most of the authors included in this volume. She also draws
                    attention to some works, not included, that would be helpful in assessing the total impact of
                    Elkins’ ideas. Eleven of the fourteen selections in this work have previously been
                    published.
            All the articles contain useful commentary and insight, but the volume contains little in direct
                    support of Elkins. A number of the authors convincingly contend that slavery was a much more open
                    society than Elkins states, some question the appropriateness of the concentration camp analogy, and
                    others present quite different points of view on the Sambo personality. Eugene Genovese says the
                    Sambo —or as he calls it, the slavish—personality existed wherever slavery
                    did, while Earl E. Thorpe thinks the Sambo personality was not the real slave personality. There was
                    much room, he says, for the development of a more complex, better rounded personality, and he feels
                    Elkins gives no real consideration to the great differences that result from being born slave and
                    being born free. Sterling Stuckey  maintains that, on balance,
                    folklore "decisively repudiates the thesis that Negroes as a group had
                    internalized Sambo traits ..." (p. 266). The supporters of Stuckey's assertion
                    that a large number of slaves were able to maintain their essential humanity may well be more
                    numerous than those who subscribe to Elkins’ thesis that slavery destroyed the adult
                    personality. It is probably safe to say that Elkins would not have been so sharply criticised if he
                    had contended that slavery prevented the development of the adult personality in
                    many blacks.
            George Frederickson and Christopher Lasch believe that prisons would have been a better analogy than
                    concentration camps and suggest the utility of Erving Goffman's various strategies of
                    accommodation that are possible in total institutions—but not in concentration
                    camps—in explaining responses of the slaves. These authors, however, quibble
                    unnecessarily over the meaning of "resistance," which to them is a political
                    concept. Roy Simon Bryce-Laporte's article (previously unpublished) uses Goffman's
                    concept of a total institution in his examination of slavery and believes the impact of the slave
                    plantation is "more appropriately understood in terms of alternative and varied behavioral
                    mechanisms used by slaves rather than [by the] prevalence of a fixed personality type derived from
                    the contrived dichotomy of choices between killing or being killed" (p. 270).
            These few remarks by no means do justice to this valuable collection which in many ways is more
                    illuminating than the work under discussion. Even so, Elkins should get reflected credit: it was he
                    who served as catalyst for these pieces. A new essay by Elkins concedes little to his critics. He
                    thinks the debate on slavery has taken on qualities similar to the one before his book, and he hopes
                    it may again be reoriented, this time along ideological lines.

                     was written as a letter to his brother under date of July 16, 1863. This long
                    "letter," approximately 40,000 words, was obviously intended for publication.
                    After Haskell's death (Cold Harbor, June 3, 1864) his brother submitted the manuscript to
                    Andrew 
                        Jackson
                     Turner, editor of the Portage Wisconsin State
                    
                    Register, who is better remembered for fathering Frederick 
                        Jackson
                     Turner. Editor Turner rejected it as being too long.
            Apparently Harvey Haskell took the manuscript to Pennsylvania where it remains as a part of the
                    collections of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Archives and History, 
                        Harrisburg
                    . About 1881 Harvey published an edited limited edition for private distribution. Daniel
                    Hall, one of Frank's Dartmouth classmates (1854), after eliminating some of the critical
                    passages, included the letter in a history of the Class of 1854 published in 1898. The Massachusetts
                    Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion reprinted the Dartmouth version in 1908. In the
                    same year the Wisconsin History Commission, which numbered among its members historian Frederick 
                        Jackson
                     Turner, issued the unabridged text in an edition of 2,500 copies. A second printing of
                    2,500 copies was issued by the commission in 1910, and it was included in that year in volume 43 of
                    the 
                        Harvard
                     Classics.

                        Titusville

                        Pennsylvania
                    ) Herald did a limited printing based on the Wisconsin History
                    Commission's edition in 1937. The work again appeared under the editorship of Bruce Catton
                    in 1957. It was reprinted from the original Haskell manuscript at 
                        Harrisburg
                     by the 
                        Titusville
                    
                    Herald in 1963. A paperback reprint of the Catton edition was released in 1969.
                    And now this long publishing history perhaps comes to a conclusion with the Byrne and Weaver
                    biography which includes the original Haskell letter of July 16, 1863.
            As a trusted member of the staff of General John Gibbon, commander of the Second Division at 
                        Gettysburg
                    , Haskell was in a strategic position to observe and participate in the defense of
                    Cemetery Ridge on the third day. According to Haskell's account he rallied General
                    Alexander Webb's Pennsylvania brigade at the crucial point of Major General George E.
                    Pickett's charge. "Acting General" Haskell also secured support from the
                    brigades commanded by N#2 J. Hall and William Harrow.
            Members of Webb's Second Brigade reacted bitterly to Haskell's account of their
                    retreat at Cemetery Ridge. Admirers of General Daniel E. Sickles also resented Haskell's
                    strictures. Some critics thought he magnified his own role. Yet, General Gibbon, who was in a
                    position to have an informed opinion, praised "his conspicuous coolness and
                    bravery" in his report and afterwards testified: "I have always thought that to
                    him, more than to any one man, are we indebted for the repulse of Lee's assault. His
                    personal gallantry in aiding the officers in reforming their overpowered troops was seen and
                    commented upon by many, whilst his quick judgment in using his authority as a staff officer of his
                    absent general in moving assistance to the critical point was admirable" (John Gibbon, Personal Recollections, 153).
            
            Major General Winfield Scott, commander of the Second Corps, joined in Gibbon's commendation
                    of Haskell. And, the final pragmatic judgment in military matters, Haskell was shortly given a jump
                    promotion to the colonelcy of a newly formed Wisconsin regiment.
            Haskell provided a detailed contemporary account of what was probably the greatest military
                    engagement ever fought in North America. It will remain a basic document in any appraisal of 
                        Gettysburg
                    . The editors have provided an excellent biographical setting which enables the reader
                    to see the man, the soldier, and the chronicler in perspective.

               Outcasts from Evolution: Scientific Attitudes of Racial Inferiority,
                        1859–1900. By John S. Haller, Jr. (
                        Urbana
                    : University of Illinois Press, 1971. Pp. xv, 228. Notes, illustrations, bibliographical
                    essay, index. $7.50.)
            
               Outcasts from, Evolution is a study of nineteenth century scientific racism in the 
                        United States
                    . In this slim volume John S. Haller of Indiana University Northwest discusses the
                    anthropometric research done during the Civil War on black and white soldiers (some deceased) which
                    "proved" black inferiority, the "proofs" of physical and mental
                    inferiority of black people provided by white southern physicians and northern insurance company
                    analysts, and racial views and studies of some leading American natural and social scientists during
                    the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
            Haller's expressed intent is to show the manner in which scientific opinion
                    "provided a vocabulary and a set of concepts which rationalized and helped to justify the
                    value system upon Which the idea of race rested in American thought" (p. x). Unfortunately,
                    he is often unclear in distinguishing "scientific" findings from opinions on race.
                    And one can question his decision to describe as scientists individuals whose opinions were backed
                    by virtually no scientific content. The statistical proofs of the physical and moral inferiority
                    which would lead to the eventual extinction of black people provided by insurance company analyst
                    Frederick Hoffman, for instance, is about as scientific (his major source was the 1890 census) as
                    the evidence marshaled by Hinton R. Helper for his well known racist monograph, Nojoque (1867).
            The author is also unclear about what he means by race, for many of his scientists are shown to have
                    held strong views on the inferiority of Irishmen and southeastern Europeans as well. His  discussion of Nathaniel S. Shaler (pp. 171–73) illustrates
                    this lack of clarity, for here Haller suggests that Outcasts is a study of
                    scientific support for cultural inferiority as well as racial inferiority. One becomes more
                    convinced of the dual nature of this study when some of the scientists, unable to prove the physical
                    inferiority of Chinese and having some knowledge of their past accomplishments, are shown to have
                    taken to theorizing about the inferiority of Chinese culture, thus suggesting racial inferiority,
                    too. In short Haller has failed to make clear that he is writing about men who used their standing
                    in the scientific community as a platform from which they could mouth what were in fact nothing more
                    than preconceived biases.
            It may be that Haller is correct that these "scientific" ideas influenced a
                    generation of Americans on race and set the foundation upon which "attitudes of racial
                    inferiority have continued to plague western culture" (p. xi) until today, but one would
                    appreciate documentation of this premise. For instance, it would be helpful to know what effects
                    these opinions had at the time on college courses, national and state legislation (he points out
                    that some of these men supported lynchings), civil rights cases, and upon the masses through popular
                    journalism. One particularly wants evidence to substantiate the allegation that the idea of the
                    ensuing extinction of black people was a widely held view and that "segregation and
                    disfranchisement were the first steps toward preparing the Negro race for its extinction"
                    (p. 210). Anthropologists and sociologists may find value in this book as an introduction to their
                    science during the nineteenth century, but it presents no new information or insights into
                    understanding racial prejudice.

               Transportation to the Seaboard: The "Communication Revolution" and
                        American Foreign Policy, 1860–1900. By Howard B. Schonberger. Contributions in American History, Number 8. (West port, Conn.: Greenwood Publishing
                    Corporation, 1971. Pp. xix, 265. Notes, selected bibliography, index. $10.50.)
            
               Transportation to the Seaboard focuses upon the struggle waged by industrialists,
                    farmers, and merchants to secure cheap transportation across the country and the effect of this
                    agitation upon America's rise to world power. Placing the transportation issue in a broad
                    politico-economic context, Schonberger divides his work into four parts: the first section, covering
                    the years 1860 to 1880, concentrates on western farmers’ and merchants’
                    demands for regulated  railroad shipping rates to widen their
                    share of the world market; part two illustrates how the transportation issue figured in the debate
                    during the 1880s over federal regulation of railroads; part three analyzes the role of three
                    railroads in carrying agricultural exports to the sea and opening new foreign markets; part four is
                    a brief conclusion.
            The author emphasizes the effect of agricultural depression upon farmer militancy and, in turn, upon
                    foreign policy. As early as 1874 the Windom report, revealing that demands for cheap transportation
                    and wider markets abroad intensified during depression periods, recommended better transportation to
                    facilitate competition with the Russians in the British grain market. Farmers demanded that Congress
                    pass legislation beneficial to overseas commerce, reduce freight rates, and make the Mississippi
                    River navigable with an outlet on the Gulf of 
                        Mexico
                    . Schonberger argues that they became economic nationalists dedicated to overseas
                    expansion long before the Spanish American War.
            Farmers were soon joined by railroad owners in the fight for wide markets. In the late 1870s and
                    early 1880s the railroads emerged battered from the rate wars and united with farmer and merchant
                    groups in calling for a subsidized merchant marine, reciprocal trade treaties, an isthmian canal,
                    and a strong navy to meet competition in European markets and to open new ones in Asia. Viewing
                    their economic survival and American expansion as inseparable, they believed that "if
                    America was to extend its economic and political interests abroad then it must lead in
                    transportation developments" (p. 239). While farmers, merchants, and businessmen agreed on
                    certain goals, they did not actively cooperate. The author never claims that the farmers’
                    and railroad barons’ search for larger markets led to the Spanish American War, but he
                    feels that their demands for governmental support in the world exchanges contributed to the growth
                    of America's empire.
            Schonberger has written a fine account of the American farmer in his transformation to capitalist
                    entrepreneur and of the railroads’ effort to become more than a link between Keokuk, 
                        Iowa
                    , and 
                        New York
                    . Adoption of an internationalist outlook by these groups contributed to the spread of
                    American influence, but the author has difficulty showing the tangible results. Selling cotton in
                    Liverpool or kerosene in 
                        China
                     may improve the trade balance but does not necessarily lead to imperialistic endeavors.
                    Schonberger does not show a direct connection between farmers’ demands for cheap
                    transportation and Caribbean bellicosity, but his build up leads one to expect it. Transportation to the Seaboard belongs chiefly in the realm of economic history, only
                    briefly touching diplomatic aspects;  but those who seek to
                    explain America's widespread involvement at the turn of the century will find much to mull
                    over in this work.

            Diplomatic historians have generally assumed that during the Gilded Age America's
                    preoccupation with industrialization and western settlement preempted a vigorous interest in foreign
                    policy. 
                        Milton
                     Plesur, professor of history at the State University of 
                        New York
                     at 
                        Buffalo
                    , believes such a view "needs serious qualification" (p. 13). He
                    contends that concern for domestic matters only veiled developments in foreign affairs and that
                    America's emergence as a world power did not catch the "national psyche off
                    guard" (p. 10). Rather there was a natural sequence of preparation for world involvement
                    and outward thrust that resulted from a "persistent commercial impulse" (p. 230).
            To substantiate this thesis Plesur explores the contemporary public attitude toward foreign affairs
                    as expressed in newspapers, periodicals, manuscripts, and official government publications. The
                    subjects selected highlight America's growing involvement overseas. Six chapters consider
                    trade and the need for markets, expansion of the State Department, literary cosmopolitanism,
                    protection of 
                        United States
                     citizens abroad, refurbishing of the navy and merchant marine, and travelers. Five
                    chapters deal with mounting American interest in Europe, Africa, Latin America, 
                        Canada
                    , and the Pacific. This organization by topic and geographic area produces less
                    repetition than might be expected. That which exists deserves only minor criticism.
            Plesur obviously believes the preparation for "America's outward thrust"
                    was economically motivated: "Business expansion and a maturing economy led to the
                    quickening of interest in America's overseas economic destiny" (p. 229);
                    "the commercial possibilities the Hawaiian Islands offered American businessmen continued
                    to pull the 
                        United States
                     deeper into diplomatic involvement in the Pacific in the postwar decades" (p.
                    205); "Shippers needed naval protection on the high seas, and real improvement in the
                    condition of the navy came only when it was successfully linked with commercial expansion"
                    (p. 95). This emphasis on commercial motivation is similar to that of Walter LaFeber's The New Empire (1963) and  William A.
                    Williams’ The Roots of the Modern American Empire (1969).
            Contemporary attitudes lead the author to conclude that the Gilded Age was a period of transition
                    between noninvolvement and involvement in world affairs. He admits America's preoccupation
                    with internal developments and its neglect of external affairs but maintains that a dynamic foreign
                    policy began to appear. The public's ambivalent attitudes reflected in his book warrant
                    this conclusion. Ideas do not change suddenly; instead old and new overlap during an intermediate
                    period. Thus, Plesur has thoughtfully, although not substantially, qualified the traditional view of
                    foreign affairs during the Gilded Age.

            David Healy has produced a reasonable, believable account of American foreign policy in the 1890s, a
                    task so difficult that few historians have come close to accomplishing it. The remarkably strident
                    language and ruffian behavior of the period has sometimes embarrassed its students or inspired them
                    excessively. Now and then the historian feels the need to apologize, calling the imperialistic age
                    an aberration, a single wayward step off the high road of American history. For those preferring
                    another sort of generalization, the period is described as a treasure trove of proofs and
                    precedents. Numerous special causes have been advanced, then ardently defended against other,
                    equally narrow interpretations. Some authors say that economic greed controls history, perfect
                    examples being the war with 
                        Spain
                     and the conquest of the 
                        Philippines
                    . These same events are also said to illustrate the destructive energy of
                    America's moralistic tradition, the power of the press, or the ever volatile condition of
                    democratic life. According to other writers the true cause of American imperialism was racism, or
                    Social Darwinism, or assorted psychic phenomena left over from the Civil War or produced by the
                    internal discontents of the 1890s.
            Healy argues with none of these interpretations. For him all have some validity; for history is
                    complex, and seven volunteers, converging on a recruiting office, might be propelled by an equal
                    number of reasons. Chapter length studies of James Harrison Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root,
                    Charles Denby, Charles A. Conant, and others show how a common policy—in this case a war
                    of  conquest—can result from pride, fear, desire for
                    financial profits, self-righteousness, boredom, insecurity, pugnacity, and other instincts, often
                    quite tangled in a single personality.
            While Healy does not attack previous efforts to explain why the 
                        United States
                     fought 
                        Spain
                    , he treats them as justifications (some shabbier than others) instead of causes; thus,
                    all lose some importance. The American people went to war and absorbed an empire simply because they
                    wanted to. Label it a physical urge, an animal instinct, or "nervous
                    intoxication," as Healy does on page 236. This, at least, is the implication of a work
                    wherein primitive urges are never successfully concealed by those who publicly proclaim that war is
                    necessary for reasons of commerce, security, national unity, biology, progress, or Christianity.
            Free of both political biases and computerized statistics, the book must depend—and most
                    successfully so—upon its author's comprehensive mastery of his period and of a
                    prose style which is clear, at times witty, and thoroughly civilized,

               The Higher Realism of Woodrow Wilson and Other Essays. By Arthur S. Link. With a
                    Foreword by Dewey W. Grantham. (
                        Nashville
                    : Vanderbilt University Press, 1971. Pp. xxii, 425. Frontispiece, notes, tables, figure,
                    index. $12.95.)
            This volume possesses three merits. It authoritatively delineates Woodrow Wilson's career,
                    effectively elucidates some intricacies of American progressivism, and conveniently collects
                    twenty-four major essays and papers of a distinguished historian. These articles demonstrate both
                    Wilson's and Link's development; yet, they are characterized by an implicit
                    continuity and coherence. What accounts for this unity is Link's plenary assertion that
                    Wilson represented "the apogee, of the Calvinistic tradition among all statesman of the
                    modern epoch" (p. 4).
            A surging sense of duty and destiny were not all that a passionate faith caused. Wilson's
                    Presbyterian inheritance instilled devotion to ordered, representative government, recognition of
                    God's sovereignty over the historical process, and repudiation of a hierarchic society
                    based upon birth or wealth. Calvinism, according to Link, "was one of the main causes ...
                    of equalitarian democracy" (p. 16) in the 
                        United States
                     and was for Wilson the animating source for the certitude that all men had an inherent
                    capacity for self-government. What is not directly attributable to Presbyterianism, in
                    Link's judgment, is the enlivened Christian social conscience distinguishing  Wilson's thought from 1907 through 1909. Link describes a
                    structural interdependence fusing Wilson's Christianity, social reform beliefs, and
                    political program. So that when the President "crossed his political Rubicon in
                    1916" by advocating and achieving a series of reforms and "a vision of the modern
                    welfare state," it was caused by his own "broadening political experiences and the
                    social gospel, which was then running at high tide in American Protestantism" (p. 18).
            One of the book's impressive features is the sustained, meticulous, and expansive analysis
                    Link has brought to virtually every aspect of Wilson's beliefs and behavior. His essays
                    refine our understanding of innumerable incidents and cogently demonstrate how apparently obvious
                    evidence can often lead to dubious or erroneous conclusions. This is especially evident in the
                    assessment of Wilson as a southerner. Link finds the South's reputed significance in
                    Wilson's formation tenuous. Wilson condemned sectionalism, held advanced attitudes towards
                    blacks, and frequently decried the South's political and social inertia. Other criteria,
                    including his theories on the nature of the Union and government's meliorative
                    responsibilites, indicate that Wilson's intellectual maturation was not molded in the
                    southern crucible.
            If the assumption that the author's published volumes on Wilson diminish the importance of
                    his essays over the last three decades, consider that this collection includes detailed evaluations
                    of Wilson's study of political administration, his governorship and Democratic party
                    activities, his diplomacy during the ordeal of neutrality, and a provocative critique of the
                    psycho-history of Sigmund Freud and William C. Bullitt. The essays are vital both for understanding
                    this formidable President and for interpreting early twentieth century American history.

               The Social Responsibilities of Business: Company and Community,
                    1900–1960. By Morrell Heald. (
                        Cleveland
                    : The Press of Case Western Reserve University, 1970. Pp. xix, 339. Notes, tables,
                    appendix, bibliographical note, index. $9.95.)
            The subject of Professor Heald's book is "the idea of social responsibility as
                    businessmen themselves have defined and experienced it" (p. xi) over the course of the
                    twentieth century. But Heald's work is no simple narrative of the growth of a new corporate
                    statesmanship. The reader is advised early in the book to discount "the popular contrast
                    between the socially conscious businessman of today  and his
                    supposedly self-centered predecessor of a century ago" (p. 2). What is at issue here is not
                    a change in moral tone but rather the search for definitions of a new social role of business
                    appropriate to an age of corporate bureaucracy and power held by large economic units.
            Heald has skillfully woven together the many strands of thought developed by twentieth century
                    business leaders in attempting to elaborate a rationale for the modern corporation. Their task was
                    to develop an explicit statement, meaningful in the context of twentieth century American society,
                    elaborating the positive social value of business institutions held implicitly in the nineteenth
                    century. In part, this attempt to define the social responsibilities of business was a response to
                    forces in the socio-political environment, such as the public attack on big business and the growth
                    of large scale government. But Heald argues that expressions of the business concept of trusteeship
                    were most widespread in the 1920s and again in the 1950s, when presumably government held a
                    favorable attitude toward business. Thus the author stresses the positive need to define and justify
                    the new social role of the manager of the modern corporation—a decision maker whose
                    economic power does not rest directly upon ownership of wealth as did the power of the old style
                    capitalist. "Managerial capitalism" implies relationships between business and the
                    community different from those characteristic of the individual proprietorship, as well as changed
                    relations among those within the business firm.
            Heald's treatment is critical, and he bases his discussion on a wide range of the literature
                    expressing the thought of corporation executives and others professing to speak for business. As the
                    author intended, his work suggests many approaches for future investigations of business thought
                    about social responsibility. Using the methodology of the intellectual historian, he recognizes that
                    the spokesmen on whose words he rests his case do not constitute a representative cross section of
                    the American business community at any time in the twentieth century. Now that Heald has defined so
                    clearly the progression of thinking of the most articulate corporate leaders, future investigators
                    may examine more carefully the penetration of new concepts of social responsibility into the
                    thinking of the rank and file among members of the business bureaucracy as well as independent
                    entrepreneurs. Even the most cursory glance at the business world today reveals a wide range of
                    thought and action regarding responsibility, including the ideas of men with a high sense of
                    professional purpose as well as of others who conducted their operations "with just
                    sufficient honesty to keep out of jail," to use the words of Aldous Huxley, cited by Heald.
            Heald's careful study should take its place on the shelf of significant  works dealing with this aspect of the history of the modern
                    corporation, such as James Willard Hurst's The Legitimacy of the Business
                        Corporation (1970) and The American Business Creed (1956) by Francis X.
                    Button et al. Heald's distinctive contribution lies in his tracing of
                    changes in the definition of role according to the categories of thought of intelligent businessmen.

            This volume contains some of the data and some of the stories about archaeology in the 
                        United States
                     which caught the author's interest as he read, studied, and conversed with
                    people. It was written in 
                        German
                     and then translated into English. The purposes of the book are to awaken interest in
                    American archaeology and to provide a framework and bibliography for readers who might be stimulated
                    to pursue various parts of the story.
            Kurt W. Marek (Ceram is a pseudonym) has given coverage to some of the important discoveries, frauds,
                    myths, personalities, problems, cultures, techniques, and sequences within the field of archaeology.
                    He has had the assistance of a number of notable American archaeologists who have given him guidance
                    and read his manuscript.
            The book begins with a short tribute to Thomas Jefferson's report of his excavation of an
                    Indian mound in Virginia and its significance in archaeological work. Next is a discussion of 
                        Columbus
                    , the Vikings, and the possible identity of the inhabitants of the east coast, followed
                    by a description of the sixteenth century Spanish penetrations into the southern part of the 
                        United States
                    , particularly the Southwest.
            Most of the presentation of 
                        United States
                     archaeology is about the Southwest area from the appearance of the first known
                    inhabitants, through the period from about A. D. 500 to 1500, and up to the present day. Along with
                    Marek's interpretation of southwestern cultural growth are comments on the nature of
                    archaeology, the development and importance of dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating, the problem
                    of the physical type, and the scarcity of early man.
            The author apparently likes to use the word "mummy"; thus, he refers to the
                    dessicated human remains from the southwest and other places as "mummies," which
                    they are not. His story about  "Little Alice"
                    should be updated to record that the subject really was "Little Al" and that he
                    was relocated and studied by Professor Louise Robbins of the University of 
                        Kentucky
                    . Marek also uses the word "pyramid" to refer to a pyramidal or
                    platform mound—they are quite different constructions. Marek, or his editors, evidently
                    prefers the spelling "shard" to the almost universally used
                    "sherd" in American archaeology.
            The personalities of archaeologists and stories about them are at least as important to Marek as are
                    the interpretations of cultural development made by archaeologists. Marek includes a chapter on some
                    of the sectarian and other unacceptable interpretations of the peopling of the New World, a
                    recounting of the Cardiff giant hoax, a version of the original development and spread of maize, and
                    even a brief mention of Piltdown man. A good yarn has a great attraction for Marek, and one of the
                    best which he recounts is the question of whether the Pueblo Indians domesticated the turkey or vice
                    versa. This reviewer found the author's tendency to shift from one subject to another after
                    a few pages distracting as well as diverting. It is, however, his style.
            Marek's volume has little or no coverage of the Pacific coast, the western area north of the
                    Southwest, the Plains, the Great Lakes area, or the area east of the Appalachians. The sections on
                    the Eastern 
                        United States
                     contain most of the author's misstatements, misinterpretations, and
                    misspellings. Careful reading of the proof by someone familiar with the East would have caught at
                    least some of them. The photographic illustrations and the drawings and maps are a fine addition to
                    the text. Footnotes are grouped together in fourteen pages near the end of the book.

                    Silver medals presenting the images of nearly all American Presidents from George 
                        Washington
                     through Benjamin Harrison were struck and given to Indian chiefs and warriors. In this
                    profusely illustrated volume Father Prucha explains their use by the federal government in its
                    dealings with the Indians and gives a brief account concerning their design and manufacture.
                    Consideration is also given to some nongovernmental silver medals including those produced by the
                    American Fur Company.
            
               Historic Houses of America Open to the Public. Edited by the editors of American Heritage; Beverley da Costa, editor in charge. Introduction by Marshall

                        New York
                    : American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc., 1971. Pp. 320. Illustrations.
                    $6.95.) This volume is a guide to historic houses 
                    within the 
                        United States
                     which are open to the public. As indicated in the introduction, there
                    are innumerable other houses of historic interest which can be visited only through personal
                    invitation. Indiana is well represented in this listing, having nearly fifty entries covering an
                    even larger number of houses. Fortunately the variety is substantial, including simple houses of
                    log, frame, brick, and stone as well as better and more elaborate houses. Hopefully this publication
                    will induce additional listings in subsequent revisions. The description of the Harmonist Museum
                    House at 
                        New Harmony
                     as "The only restored Rappite dwelling in 
                        New Harmony
                    " (p. 78) is a glaring inaccuracy, while the comment that a log house near New
                    Trenton, said to have been built about 1810, is "Possibly the oldest log house in the
                        Ohio River Valley" (p. 78) represents a generous amount of
                    historical embellishment. Complete accuracy in such matters may not be attainable, but authenticity is at least an important in historical commentary as in architectural
                    preservation.

                        United States

                    incomplete, the volume is nevertheless a helpful compilation to persons seeking information
                    available on tapes and/or transcripts therefrom.
            
               Letters of Louis D. Brandeis. Volume I (1870–1907): Urban
                        Reformer. Edited by Melvin I. Urofsky and David W. Levy. (
                        Albany
                    : State University of 
                        New York
                     Press, 1971. Pp. xlii, 610. Illustrations, notes, index. $20.00.) Louis D.
                    Brandeis, a native of 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , was by 1910, according to the editors,
                    "a virtual symbol of reform sentiment, a man universally respected and welcomed in
                    progressive circles" (p. xxxi). This volume of his letters takes Brandeis from the age of
                    thirteen into the midst of his career as a corporate lawyer and a progressive social reformer in 
                    
                        Boston
                    . The editors believe the life of a great man can be instructive and feel that
                    Brandeis’ letters can help account for his greatness. The bulk of the letters considered
                    for publication are in the Brandeis collection at the University of 
                        Louisville
                     Law School, but the editors have gathered together thousands of letters from other
                    collections and individuals. The letters selected deal little with the private man although this
                    volume contains excerpts from Brandeis’ letters to his wife during their courtship;
                    rather "the figure who stands revealed in these letters will seem, very often, the austere
                    and efficient public man" (p. xix). Overall, the collection of letters will serve as an
                    important record of reform activity in the early twentieth century, will provide some illumination
                    of American Zionism, and will provide new perspectives on Brandeis’ years
                    (1916–1939) as a justice on the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court. Judging from the present volume the editors have selected well and
                    judiciously. Their editing is clear, and annotation is generally quite sufficient—more
                    often too much detail rather than too little information. According to the dust jacket volume II
                    (1907–1912) will appear in 1972 and subsequent volumes annually. Pamela J.

               Early American Tornadoes, 1586–1870. By David M. Ludlum. The History of American Weather. (
                        Boston
                    : American Meteorological Society, 1970, Pp. 219. Maps, illustrations, appendix,
                    indices. $10.00.) The purpose of this series "is to relate the facts concerning
                    the development of the science of meteorology in the Americas and to describe the principal weather
                    events in our climatic past by a series of historical monographs" (p. ii). The present
                    volume chronologically within geographical divisions (New 
                        England
                    , Middle Atlantic area, Old South, Old Northwest) presents contemporary descriptions,
                    with discussion, of over 100 tornado like storms. The cut off date of 1870 is determined by the
                    establishment of "the first Federal weather observing and storm warning system"
                    (p. vii) and the greater systemization of meteorological reporting. The collection was limited by
                    lack of reports in sparsely settled areas and difficulty in determining whether a report really did
                    describe a tornado. One section, "Early American Thought on Tornadoes," presents
                    summaries of and excerpts from the works of early investigators such as Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                    , James P. Espy, and William C. Redfield. This part is particularly informative although
                    present residents of the regions covered will no doubt be interested in comparing the early storms
                    discussed here with more recent meteorological events. Pamela J. Bennett, Indiana

               The Decline and Abolition of Negro Slavery in

                    appendices, bibliography, index. $8.50.) Professor Lombardi gives a brief history of 
                        Venezuela
                     for the period indicated but centers his attention on the status and then the decline
                    of Negro slavery in this South American country. He suggests that slavery was never a basic and
                    deeply rooted institution in 
                        Venezuela
                    , which in turn suggests that persons interested in the history of slavery in the Ohio
                    Valley might find information and ideas of interest from this study.
