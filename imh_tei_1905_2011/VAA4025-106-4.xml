                <p>In the decades before the Civil War, the Reverend Lyman Beecher and his
                    accomplished children challenged the consciences and held the imaginations of
                    Americans as few others of their day. When Beecher left <placeName><settlement

                    he was considered the preeminent New England preacher, &quot;a general and a
                    statesman&quot; in &quot;the Kingdom of Christ&quot; and a leader of
                    Presbyterian reform. Under his leadership, Lane was charged with training
                    Presbyterian ministers as missionaries &quot;to hold the great West for
                    Protestantism.&quot; Beecher&apos;s sons and daughters followed in his venerable
                    footsteps as pastors, educators, and leaders in the struggle against slavery.

                <p> Within the Beecher family, Charles (1815-1900), the ninth of eleven children,

                    and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and their luminous father. An examination of Charles

                    helps us understand the changes within the denomination on the western frontier.
                    Finally, Charles&apos;s emergence in the early 1850s as a national spokesman for
                    abolition can be understood as part of a continuum begun during his years in

                    in May 1844 to take the pulpit of the newly organized Second Presbyterian
                    Church, he was an unlikely candidate for success. Twenty-nine years old, he had
                    only the previous year been licensed as a Presbyterian minister after a long
                    period of self-doubt and rejection of traditional Calvinism. Although every one
                    of Lyman Beecher&apos;s children diverged from their father&apos;s Calvinism to
                    some degree, Charles seems to have had the hardest time coming into the
                    Presbyterian fold. Following in his brothers&apos; well-worn footsteps by
                    entering the ministry ran counter to his temperament. Studies of Charles during
                    the decade before he arrived in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    portray him as extremely self-absorbed and given to adolescent affectations that
                    embarrassed his family. While his moody personality no doubt reflected an
                    extreme case of angst, Charles seems to have been ill-equipped to cope with the
                        world.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p>

                        <p>Charles Beecher, c. 1870. Known for his writings on theology and the
                            Bible and for his public opposition to slavery, Beecher established his
                            first pastorate in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"

                    passion for music was such that he declared he would earn his living from it—a
                    keen disappointment to his father, who assumed that all of his sons would follow
                    the deathbed wish of his beloved first wife, Roxana, that they enter the
                    ministry. Even more distressing to Lyman and the family was Charles&apos;s
                    rejection of fundamental Presbyterian theology. His interest in the popular
                    &quot;science&quot; of phrenology led him to doubt that human beings could
                    possess free will; his personal reading of Jonathan Edwards&apos;s theology
                    confirmed that belief. Charles further <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-106-4-012"/>
                    reasoned that the inevitable human condition—his own included—was that of
                    infidelity. In the words of biographer Marie Caskey, Charles now believed that
                    &quot;[w]ithout free will, there could be no such thing as religious faith or
                        hope.&quot;<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p>
                <p>Despite his doubts, in 1834 Charles returned to the Beecher fold after his
                    graduation from college. Controversy had followed Lyman from
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013445" reg="Boston"
                            >Boston</settlement></placeName>, even though he had moved west to avoid
                    theological dispute in favor of saving the inhabitants of the new western
                    frontier. By the time Charles arrived, Lyman had already survived a trial for
                    heresy, arising from the growing New School/Old School split within
                        Presbyterianism.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Lane Seminary had also lost fifty-one
                    students the previous school year, when the board of trustees had forbidden them
                    to express support for abolitionism. Despite Lyman&apos;s attempts to moderate
                    between factions, a large group of students had angrily withdrawn from the
                        seminary.<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>Other members of the Beecher family, too, faced controversy over their
                    antislavery beliefs. Charles&apos;s scholarly oldest brother Edward, president
                    of Illinois College in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2028478"

                    series of sermons outlining a revisionist theology aimed at elevating the

                            is helpful on Lyman Beecher&apos;s theology. The Old School/New School
                            division within Presbyterianism involved a number of factors. Doctrinal
                            disputes raged over narrowly differing views of &quot;sin, human
                            ability, and salvation.&quot; Old School leaders wanted the Presbyterian
                            Church to have complete control over its missionaries; the New School
                            cooperated with other denominations, particularly through the American
                            Home Missionary Society. New School adherents were more likely to be
                            active in reform movements, especially for the abolition of slavery. For

                <p>Both Henry and Charles attended classes at Lane Seminary. Henry assiduously

                    contrast, Charles withdrew from political conflicts and intellectual debates
                    into a solitary melancholy. Having proposed marriage to Sarah Coffin while in
                    college, Charles now broke off the relationship, believing himself to be in love
                    with another girl. He became his own brooding romantic fictional character,
                    hopelessly yearning for a beautiful young maiden. In 1838, at the age of 23, he
                    cut himself off from his family to seek adventure as a musician in

                    life, Charles recalled how his father said goodbye: &quot;&apos;My son,&apos; he
                    said, with quivering lip, &apos;eternity is long!&apos; and, with a glance of
                    anguish and a grasp of the hand, he turned away.&quot; The absent Charles became
                    the focus of Sunday morning family prayers.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                <p>During the next two years, Charles&apos;s rebellion was tempered by his exposure
                    to slavery, as well as by personal illness and prolonged poverty. Forced to take
                    a job as a clerk at a wholesale house, he was sickened by what he saw of slavery
                    when he visited cotton plantations to collect debts from planters. Prostrated by
                    yellow fever and again dependent on his father for financial survival, Charles
                    realized that he needed to change the direction of his life. He reestablished
                    his relationship with Sarah, and they married in 1840. While Charles had
                    languished in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014214"

                    position as organist and choir director at the rapidly growing church, Charles
                    eagerly accepted. The young couple, with their first-born son, became part of

                <p>For the next few years, Charles turned Second Presbyterian Church into a center
                    for classical and religious music. His Bible studies classes and occasional
                    sermons were popular and well attended. Aside from any recognition he earned,
                    however, he had little income and was again forced to depend on his
                    father&apos;s limited resources.</p>
                <p>Charles&apos;s life made an abrupt turn in March 1843 when he underwent a
                    transformative experience that his family understood as a coming to God and
                    acceptance of Christ. The last of Lyman and Roxana&apos;s sons to undergo this
                    apparent conversion, Charles was now considered &quot;safe&quot; in his
                    religious beliefs and ready to enter the ministry. Henry lost no time in
                    arranging for Charles to be brought before an examining board of the
                    Indianapolis Presbytery in August 1843. According to records, Charles was
                    granted a license to preach anywhere within the bounds of the Presbyterian
                    Church. When Henry learned of an opening in Fort Wayne&apos;s First Presbyterian
                    Church, he saw an opportunity for Charles to have a church of his own and, for
                    the first time, a regular, if meager, income with which to support his
                        family.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>
                <p>Henry was eager to help Charles for personal reasons as well. Located on the

                    Church was the denomination&apos;s most important church in the area; securing
                    control of its pulpit would add to Henry&apos;s growing reputation for church
                    leadership. Henry also embraced the challenge as one more chapter in the
                    continuing New School-Old School war. Nowhere was the competition for control
                    more bitter than among the emerging Presbyterian congregations in

                    Dr. William C. Anderson to preach on the Sunday morning before Beecher&apos;s
                    arrival. Intent nevertheless on establishing a New School congregation for
                    Charles, Henry wooed prospective churchgoers for two weeks in April, preaching
                    in the musty Allen County Courthouse and visiting in homes. Henry also had the
                    support of prominent banker Hugh McCulloch. McCulloch had often visited
                    Henry&apos;s church when he traveled to <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"

                    The banker offered Charles and his family a place to stay in his spacious home.
                    By the time Charles arrived in early May, Henry had drawn six members away from
                    the First Presbyterian congregation. Among these charter members was Susan Man
                    McCulloch, Hugh&apos;s wife, who as a schoolgirl had attended Catherine
                    Beecher&apos;s female academy in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    but sufficient number. Plans were put into place to secure partial funding from
                    the American Home Missionary Society (AHMS), the <placeName><settlement

                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, and Charles found himself
                    &quot;pitched&quot; into what he came to consider &quot;the hardest [religious]

                    membership, but attendance at Sunday evening meetings often reached 150. People
                    came to services in the courthouse expecting debates with First
                    Presbyterian&apos;s pastor and leaders. Charles later recalled being told that
                    he needed to &quot;put in [his] best licks&quot; and &quot;knock the socks off
                    those Old School folks!&quot; Beecher instead told people that he &quot;had
                    nothing particular to say for New School&quot; because he &quot;always supposed
                    his father knew all about that.&quot; When asked why he had come to

                <p>As Charles began to visit people about town, he met many who were not aligned
                    with organized churches. They were intellectually curious, some leaning toward
                    Universalism, others Unitarians like Hugh McCulloch, &quot;skeptical, utterly
                    beyond the reach of any existing organization.&quot; Although they did not agree
                    with what he preached, they opposed the persecution of his little church.
                    Charles later wrote that <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-106-4-018"/> they were willing
                    &quot;to hear the Gospel,&quot; and &quot;before they knew it, the Lord had a
                    cord around their hearts and they became warm personal friends.&quot; Committing
                    themselves to the growth of the congregation, the new supporters pledged $300,
                    no small sum for the day.<hi rend="sup">14</hi></p>
                <p>In the following weeks, Old School leaders, including a visiting pastor from
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, continued to label
                    Charles&apos;s small congregation as a group of Unitarians and heretics and
                    attempted to persuade newcomers that First Presbyterian Church was the real New
                    School church. Once again, Charles&apos;s strategy was disarming. He encouraged
                    members and friends in his congregation to attend meetings that First
                    Presbyterian organized. Charles invited their visiting pastor to preach at his
                    service, and in turn he attended prayer meetings at First Presbyterian, where he
                    &quot;talked and sang and prayed and wept.&quot;<hi rend="sup">15</hi></p>

                    tested his physical and emotional fortitude. In his first quarterly report to
                    the AHMS home office in September 1844, Charles candidly reported the
                    difficulties he faced. He was still recovering from an illness that had kept him
                    confined all winter. His wife&apos;s health was poor as well, preventing her
                    from visiting new acquaintances. Membership in his church had risen to nineteen,
                    but only a very small number were males. Stressing the importance of Fort Wayne
                    to both factions of Presbyterianism, Charles wrote that the Old School had sent
                    a second pastor to the area to build support; he hoped that the AHMS as well
                    would send more missionaries. The Old School&apos;s charges of heresy against
                    his church continued to be &quot;uncompromising,&quot; even if disguised in
                    &quot;civil&quot; and &quot;polished&quot; language.<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>
                <p>Charles felt that his greatest difficulty, however, was his personal deficiency
                    in faith-&quot;my own evil heart &amp; want of genuine conformity to the spirit
                    &amp; example of Jesus.&quot; Haunted by old feelings of inadequacy, he confided
                    to the director of the AHMS that he had &quot;the misfortune&quot; of being
                    &quot;rather original&quot; which led to charges of being &quot;any thing but

                    nevertheless helped Charles recognize his commitment to his mission: &quot;Now

                    somehow dear to God, I would not stand a day longer.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                    >17</hi></p>
                <p>On a reassuring note, Charles reported that he had been well received when he
                    preached in the country and that he knew of four locations where New School
                    churches could be organized. Furthermore, he had obtained music books; the
                    ladies&apos; sewing society was raising funds for oil lamps needed for evening
                    services; and Henry&apos;s church in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    were particularly lifted because there was &quot;a good prospect of a large
                    singing school&quot; later in the fall.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
                <p>Family letters tell a similar story of Charles&apos;s hardships. Charles confided
                    to his father that he felt pulled down by a &quot;jaded, overwearied sense of
                    inability&quot; and was again plagued by religious doubt. Recalling his own
                    periods of despondency, Lyman responded with a long letter detailing rules he
                    tried to follow that kept him in balance and prevented doctrinal conflict. Lyman
                    cautioned Charles that only after great consideration should he &quot;push
                    noiselessly, and with unprovoking, meek modesty, a new truth amid the
                    prescriptive rights of error.&quot; Furthermore, Lyman advised to &quot;[n]ever
                    attack the opposite opinion, or amplify its absurdity or mischief, or stigmatize
                    it by hard names.&quot; In the early fall, Henry learned that attacks by Old
                    School opponents were so serious that Charles might lose his church and be
                    permanently damaged by accusations of Unitarian sympathies. In a letter hastily
                    written to their father on September 13, 1844, Henry stressed &quot;that
                    everything depends upon his [Charles] succeeding in this enterprise.&quot;

                    late on Saturday afternoon, covered with mud but in high spirits following a day
                    and a half of continuous travel. From his home in Walnut Hills outside of

                            >Cincinnati</settlement></placeName> he had traveled north by canal to

                            >Ohio</region></placeName>. Then, following a brief rest, he had set off
                    around 10:00 p.m. to ride the remaining sixty-two miles to
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"

                    elderly man&apos;s stamina was clearly reason for celebration. Revived by a cold
                    bath, a whiskey rubdown, and a hearty supper, Lyman rose the next morning with
                    renewed energy to deliver sermons twice that day. On each successive evening he
                    led worship services and discussions until Henry&apos;s arrival at the end of
                    the week. Clearly, Lyman relished the challenge of establishing Charles in a New

                    &quot;proved to be one of the most social and agreeable of men,&quot; McCulloch
                    wrote. &quot;[H]e abounded in sympathy, in geniality, in good-will for

                    solemnity and decorum. His responses to questions regarding doctrinal beliefs
                    and his trial sermon on faith no doubt reflected the family advice he had
                    received over the previous months. In the evening candlelight ceremony,
                    following a sermon by Henry, Dr. Beecher concluded the service by giving the
                    ministerial charge. Charles was fulfilling his late mother&apos;s dying wish

                    tranquillize the world.&quot; Finally, he reminded Charles of the great cause
                    before them: &quot;To plant Christianity in the West is as grand an undertaking
                    as to plant it in the Roman empire, with unspeakable greater permanence and

                    financial commitment from business leaders and new friends to a building fund so
                    that the church could move out of the stifling room at the courthouse and into a
                    building of its own by the next summer. At the end of November, supporters had
                    pledged a total of $1500. A suitable lot &quot;two blocks from the public

                    activities now included a Sabbath school for young people, Sunday afternoon and
                    evening services in the courthouse, the hoped-for singing school (with 57
                    attendees), and a monthly concert series. He was meeting as well with a group of
                    people five miles west of town, where a young man of his church led a Sabbath
                    school. Indicating that he was not able to stay away entirely from controversy,
                    Charles confided that during the fall presidential elections he had made it
                    known he would not vote, even though members of his congregation, with one
                    exception, were staunch Whigs. &quot;It is well however for them to learn at the
                    start that their pastors vote is his own, not theirs,&quot; he wrote. What
                    Charles left unstated was his opposition to Henry Clay as the Whig candidate for

                    clearly demonstrated his own personal gifts. In the next five and a half years,
                    he drew people from across denominational and socioeconomic lines to a wide
                    range of religious and civic programs. One could argue that his successes were
                    due to the sheer exuberance of his personality and his unflagging energy,
                    qualities generally attributed to all of the Beechers. Unquestionably, Charles
                    also impressed people with his remarkable intellect and his gifts as a preacher
                    and musician. As one would expect from a Beecher, Charles also strove to be a

                <p>While mutual affection helps explain the continued growth of the congregation,
                    Charles obviously felt he had found his calling. He organized concerts, singing

                    &quot;Nobody goes to sleep under his preaching.&quot; Attendance at Sunday
                    services grew to be as high as 200; singing classes swelled to 130. In the
                    church&apos;s first years, several community leaders served as trustees,
                    including Royal Taylor, Benjamin W Oakley, and Hugh McCulloch.<hi rend="sup"
                        >26</hi></p>
                <p>Charles rejoiced that people who attended his services had &quot;more intellect
                    than any other or all others here.&quot; He was particularly pleased by a prayer
                    meeting led by congregation members and an evening discussion group that
                    encouraged even the most shy to talk about subjects ranging from temperance to
                    prayer to church business. As his church grew, he thought that members showed
                    &quot;more seriousness ... &amp; less skepticism.&quot; As Charles had hoped,
                    his congregation served as an example to other churches, if not yet of &quot;a
                    progressive state of holiness&quot; then at least of a new religious

                <p>Charles&apos;s ministry continued to reach into surrounding rural areas. Before
                    the new building was completed in February 1846, he reported to the AHMS that he
                    had scheduled regular Sunday morning meetings alternately in five different
                    areas near Fort Wayne, riding back to town for the afternoon and evening
                    services at the courthouse. The congregation five miles west on the Yellow River
                    Road toward Columbia City included about fifty persons. At another location,

                    of five different denominations met together and, according to Charles,
                    &quot;agreed to lay aside their differences &amp; unite upon a simple

                    own building, Charles continued to ride out in the early mornings to preach in
                    two rural neighborhoods. A number of country people also joined his

                <p>Charles&apos;s ministry extended beyond New School Presbyterian borders through
                    various reform associations. In the spring of 1845, for example, he formed a
                    committee with other pastors and lay leaders to &quot;seek out indigent persons
                    and persons in distress, in this vicinity and afford them relief.&quot; In
                    October, he led community religious leaders in forming a society to bring about
                    the &quot;moral and social improvement&quot; of laborers and boatmen who had
                    swarmed into the area due to the rapid growth of the <geogName key="tgn_7026035"

                    one of three ministers who agreed to contact the American Bethel Society to
                    request that a missionary be sent to the area the next spring. Soon afterward,
                    collections were taken to purchase Bibles to be distributed to &quot;the
                    destitute of the counties of Allen and Adams&quot;—for religious reasons,
                    certainly, but also to promote literacy among people with few opportunities for
                    schooling. In addition, Charles frequently wrote to the AHMS on behalf of Rev.
                    John Bayer, a missionary among German immigrants in <placeName><region

                <p>In this same period, Charles was also taking a public stand in support of New
                    School Presbyterianism. In October 1845, less than a year after his ordination,
                    he joined his brother Henry and twenty-seven other ministers and elders to form
                    the Constitutional Presbyterian Church of Indiana. In one of the first of many
                    efforts by New School ministers to push the Presbyterian General Assembly (New
                    School) to take a stronger position against slavery, they called for a meeting
                    prior to the May Triennial Assembly in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    the evil.&quot; Charles&apos;s association with this initiative did not prompt a
                    response from more conservative ministers within the Fort Wayne (New School)

                <p> The four-part lecture series entitled the &quot;Genuineness, Authenticity, and
                    Entire Inspiration of the Sacred Scriptures&quot; began with a study of the
                    first five books of the Bible. In a quarterly report to the AHMS, Charles
                    described a generally positive response from large audiences he categorized as
                    skeptics, infidels, Jews, Universalists and &quot;Nothingarians,&quot; eager to
                    hear evidence &quot;that the Bible was Gods word.&quot; He encouraged open
                    discussions, emphasized understanding biblical texts apart from any religious
                    creed, and promoted study and prayer. He declared his lectures a welcome
                    alternative to Alexander Rankin&apos;s &quot;stiff dose of Calvinistic Logic as
                    dry as brick-dust &amp; hard as the nether mile-stone.&quot; Out of knowledge of
                    the Bible, Charles believed, would come faith.<hi rend="sup">31</hi></p>
                <p>The dedication of the new Second Presbyterian Church building on February 22,
                    1846, was a celebration of accomplishment. In little over one year, the young
                    congregation had raised some $2500 and built an attractive brick edifice that
                    was completely furnished and paid for. Charles alone had collected $500 from
                    other New School congregations. Aside from the celebration, however, the
                    dedication ceremony was also an opportunity for Charles to challenge his
                    opponents and test the degree of support his fledgling congregation was willing
                    to give him.<hi rend="sup">32</hi></p>
                <p>Morning and afternoon, before a crowded sanctuary, Charles preached in support of
                    greater religious freedom, arguing that it was unrealistic to expect &quot;to
                    create absolute unity of belief.&quot; He told the assembled listeners: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">Even on what we are pleased to term fundamental truths,
                        there must exist different modes of seeing; different grades of believing;
                        different forms of expressing; and the only unity that ever will be attained
                        before the Resurrection of the Just, on earth, will be a unity of thinking
                        differently, in love.</quote>

                    from narrow paths of religious study which required them to follow a
                    denominational creed in addition to the Bible: &quot;[L]iberty of opinion in our
                    Theological Seminaries is a mere form.&quot; No doubt speaking from his own
                    experience, he made the case that ministers who deviated from their
                    denominational creed were &quot;whispered to be <hi rend="i">unsound, unsafe,
                        heretical</hi>.&quot; They risked losing their members, their reputations,
                    and their very livelihood. &quot;There is something criminal in saying anything
                    new. It is shocking to utter words that have not the mould of age upon
                    them.&quot; More than ever, Charles said, he was firmly convinced that the Bible
                    was &quot;the perfect and thorough furniture of the Christian minister.&quot;
                    Finding God&apos;s love in the Bible offered hope to a world that otherwise
                    seemed to be set on a course of destruction. This was his strategy for winning
                    the religious war for the West, for enabling mankind to avoid &quot;that final
                    storm of divine indignation which shall sweep away the vain refuges of
                        lies.&quot;&quot;<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>

                    person he was when you were here,&quot; she wrote her mother. Indicating a
                    noticeable difference of opinion in the community, however, she added, &quot;If
                    he is spared, he will make a noise in the world.&quot; Following his sermons, a
                    committee of fellow New School ministers of the Fort Wayne Presbytery
                    interviewed him to express grave concerns over what they considered his
                    &quot;misapprehension of the views and practices of the Presbyterian
                    Church.&quot; While they agreed not to press charges of heresy against him, they
                    filed a report expressing their opinion that some of Charles&apos;s views were

                    reports to the society exposed a less public side of his ministry. He had found
                    it too costly to feed his horse, he wrote, and preferred instead to sell it so
                    that he could have additional income. Revealing the common practice of paying
                    the minister in goods rather than currency, he reported that church members had
                    been tardy with contributions of wood, bringing five loads only when the need
                    became known; a sexton had only recently been appointed to help; and he was
                    waiting for the quarterly support from the AHMS to pay his rent. Moreover, he

                <p>In correspondence with Lyman, Charles revealed his hesitancy to stand out as a

                    only lectures that were not controversial. Charles, however, could not stay long
                    on the sidelines of issues he regarded as morally impelling.<hi rend="sup"

                <p>Less than two months after his doubt-filled letter to his father, Charles
                    delivered a sermon on principles &quot;which must be applied.., in all ensuing
                    elections, high and low, or our country is forever ruined.&quot; The text was
                    published in full in the local <hi rend="i">Times &amp; Press</hi> on August 21,
                    1847, to quell what he termed &quot;some misunderstanding.&quot; Charles took a
                    step into the political arena, building a case against voting for either
                    candidate in the campaign underway for U.S. Representative for the Tenth
                    Congressional District. Voting was &quot;a high privilege, a duty,&quot; and
                    &quot;a principle that must revolutionize the world,&quot; he argued. Even if a
                    man were in &quot;a minority of self alone,&quot; a Christian was justified in
                    withholding his vote from any candidate who violated God&apos;s universal and
                    eternal commandments. Without naming either candidate, he clearly targeted Whig
                    William G. Ewing and Democrat William Rockhill, both prosperous businessmen from
                            <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002143" reg="Allen">Allen
                            County</region></placeName>. Ewing&apos;s candidacy was particularly
                    controversial because he allegedly owned slaves in <placeName><region

                <p>Public reactions to Charles&apos;s sermon were surprisingly muted, given the
                    local Whig support for Ewing. Reporting to the AHMS in the spring of 1848 on
                    events of the last year, he wrote that he was making some progress, although the
                    period had been difficult. &quot;Moral influences came to a head in that year
                    tendi[n]g to drive me away. Odd fellowship, Sons of Temperence, Infidelity, And
                    Universalism, had all received rebuke, &amp; grown restive. Politics also had
                    felt a little sore.&quot;<hi rend="sup">39</hi></p>
                <p>Charles continued to devote much time to bringing the Bible to life for his
                    congregation. &quot;I am ... stedfast in faith—and steadily
                    teaching—teaching—teaching—unfolding the Bible—explaining, defending—&amp;
                    pouring out of it waters of life,&quot; he reported to the AHMS. Scenes from
                    Christ&apos;s life became so real to him that he collected a series of lectures
                    into a narrative entitled <hi rend="i">The Incarnation; or, Pictures of the
                        Virgin and Her Son</hi>. Helped in part by Harriet&apos;s editing and by her
                    growing reputation as a writer, the book was published by the New York firm
                    Harper and Brothers in 1849. Episodes such as the journey of Mary and Joseph to
                    Bethlehem and Jesus&apos; temptation in the wilderness were packed with
                    emotional description and a visceral immediacy. In the wilderness, as night
                    falls, &quot;a thousand beasts prowl forth,&quot; and Jesus &quot;hears their

                <p>A review from the <hi rend="i">New York Weekly Mirror</hi> reprinted in the Fort
                    Wayne Times described Charles&apos;s work as one of &quot;delicate fancy,
                    dramatic power, felicity in description, and occasional instances of splendid
                    imagination,&quot; on a level with Milton&apos;s <hi rend="i">Paradise
                        Regained</hi>. The reviewer for the Times was far less kind, describing
                    Charles&apos;s writing style as obscure and redundant. The book was available
                    locally at the bookstore of D. W Burroughs on Columbia Street, the commercial
                    hub of the town near the canal.<hi rend="i">41</hi></p>
                <p>In his correspondence with the AHMS and with his family, Charles again despaired
                    over his role as a minister. He felt that churches had become a business,
                    &quot;seeking to secure the patronage of that half of the community that
                    contributes.&quot; &quot;I feel deeply sensible that we are in Babylon
                    here,&quot; he wrote in one letter to the AHMS; a few months later he wrote that
                    &quot;the Enemy here is So Mightily Entrenched in the Church so-called.&quot; In
                    letters to family, he predicted the consequences of humanity living in
                    &quot;alienation from God&quot; and &quot;alienation from his neighbor.&quot;
                    &quot;This guilty land will not escape,&quot; he wrote to Harriet. &quot;Father
                    may not live to see it. But I for one expect either to die by violence or to
                    live in the fastness and retreats of the forest. The plot is laid. The explosion
                    will come soon.&quot; In predicting a coming judgment day, Charles expressed a
                    militant zeal that was widely shared by Protestants in the years leading up to
                    the Civil War. Given his commitment to righting the wrongs of the world, Charles
                    could also have been reacting to the increasing conflicts in his own life.<hi

                <p>Charles and Sarah now had four children, and lack of finances continued to beset
                    the family. In January 1849, a local newspaper ran an invitation to a
                    &quot;Donation Visit&quot; to the Beechers, for which visitors brought clothing
                    and other goods for the pastor&apos;s household. Epidemic disease was still a

                    led community prayer services and attended the dying. In these same months,
                    Charles expanded his reform activities, participating in a series of temperance

                    Family loyalties were pulling Charles back to the East.</p>
                <p>The family&apos;s overwhelming health problems became a decisive factor in their
                    departure. Charles was so exhausted and weak that Lyman and several of his
                    friends recommended that he step down from the ministry altogether. Sarah was
                    &quot;nearly prostrated&quot; by illness, and three of their four children
                    suffered from a malarial fever, known at the time as ague. Years of living on a
                    missionary&apos;s limited salary were taking their toll, and the coming

                            >Indiana</region></placeName> summer was something to dread. &quot;The
                    indications of providence have been such as to determine me to remove my family

                <p>In fact, Charles had made the decision to leave his church and

                    departure, however, was unfortunate. In April 1850, he had become the stated

                    commitment. Over his six years in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    he had earned wide respect and affection. He had more often than not been

                    terms. His ministry had moved beyond his father&apos;s cautious guidelines, even

                    ministry, Charles was inevitably pulled into debates over the great moral issue
                    of slavery. He also confronted fellow ministers in the Fort Wayne Presbytery and
                    fellow temperance leaders over institutional racism toward free blacks that few
                    whites wanted to acknowledge. By the time he returned to New England in the
                    summer of 1850, he was ready to join Edward, Henry, and Harriet on the national
                    antislavery stage.</p>
                <p>As far back as 1818, the Presbyterian General Assembly had declared slavery
                    &quot;a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights of nature,&quot;
                    &quot;utterly inconsistent with the law of God&quot; and &quot;totally
                    irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the Gospel of Christ.&quot;
                    Moreover, the same assembly had urged Christians &quot;to efface this blot on
                    our holy religion&quot; by completely abolishing slavery &quot;throughout
                    Christendom, and if possible throughout the world.&quot; Since that time,
                    however, Presbyterian leaders had avoided &quot;harsh censures&quot; on their
                    religious brethren. Following the Old School-New School division in 1838, New
                    School ministers had become even more restrained.</p>

                    ministers were threatened with the walkout of angry parishioners. Charles&apos;s

                    threatened to withdraw because of an unfounded rumor that he had organized a
                    temperance and abolitionist church. In 1843, at his church in

                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>, Henry Ward Beecher had preached,
                    in careful and particular terms, against the general moral evil of slavery, had
                    called for its gradual extinction under existing laws, and had avoided explicit
                    condemnation of slaveholders, fearing similar reactions, if not mob violence.<hi

                <p>Charles took his first public step into the slavery debate in the fall of 1845.
                    Together with a minority of other Indiana New School Presbyterian ministers and
                    elders (including his increasingly emboldened brother Henry), he urged the
                    upcoming New School Presbyterian General Assembly to take a position that
                    slaveholding was a sin. The ministers declared that slavery was &quot;paralyzing
                    the efforts of the Church in propagating the pure gospel of Christ.&quot; It was
                    &quot;injurious to the soul of the master and a grievous wrong to the
                    slave.&quot; This was a bold contrast to the non-confrontational position
                    prevalent among the national leadership. In urging the denomination to declare
                    slaveholding a sin, Charles publicly joined the abolitionist faction within the
                    Presbyterian Church, separating himself not only from his father but also from
                    most of his Fort Wayne Presbytery and Indiana New School colleagues.<hi
                        rend="sup">48</hi></p>
                <p>In May 1847, Charles directly challenged his New School colleagues. In a letter
                    to the <hi rend="i">Fort Wayne Sentinel</hi>, he used the occasion of a recent
                    meeting of the presbytery to voice concerns about the conditions of African
                    Americans in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>. His colleagues had recently approved two
                    resolutions concerning slavery: &quot;That slavery is a great sin, opposed to
                    the word of God, and Contrary to the rights of man&quot;; and &quot;That slavery
                    in the church should be a subject of discipline the same as any other
                    crime.&quot; While approving both positions, Charles felt the need to address
                    the pressing problems of African Americans in the so-called &quot;free&quot;
                    North. Had he been present at their meeting, he wrote, he would have added
                    another resolution: &quot;Resolved, That the disenfranchisement of free <list

                <p>By the winter of 1848 Charles&apos;s reputation as an abolitionist had spread
                    well beyond <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933"
                            reg="Fort Wayne">Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName>. He was asked to
                    consider taking the pulpit of a large, new Congregational church in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717"
                            reg="District of Columbia">Washington, D.C.</settlement></placeName>,
                    looking for &quot;a preacher of firmness and decision, who is a sound, thinking,
                    reasoning abolitionist.&quot; One of their chief advisers and financial backers
                    was Lewis Tappan, the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567"
                            reg="New York">New York</settlement></placeName> antislavery leader and
                    philanthropist. The church promised a free pulpit and an annual salary of $1500,
                    a far cry from the $400 Charles received from the AHMS.<hi rend="sup"
                    >50</hi></p>
                <p>Writing to his father, Charles anticipated how he might serve such a
                    congregation. He would win antislavery converts not through rationalism but
                    through Christianity&apos;s law to &quot;love the Lord thy God with all thy
                    heart and thy neighbor as thy self&quot; and through teaching the Bible.
                    &quot;Hence I should expect to be at liberty to preach sermons, as many as might
                    be necessary, in which I should say nothing about slavery.&quot; Charles did not
                    pursue the offer, and his lack of enthusiasm for such a challenge suggests that
                    he feared that the new church would find his ideology not &quot;sound in the
                    sense that it is like that of the majority (or minority) either.&quot; Moreover,
                    the offer had come at the same time that Second Presbyterian in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                            >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName> was initiating steps to install
                    Charles as their permanent minister. What Charles seems to have left unsaid was
                    that, &quot;originality&quot; and all, he felt accepted at Second Presbyterian
                        Church.<hi rend="sup">51</hi></p>
                <p>In the fall of 1849, Charles found an opportunity to voice his most forceful
                    arguments to date against the oppression of African Americans in northern
                    states. Through a series of local meetings, he had become acquainted with the
                    Sons of Temperance, a new statewide society that was attracting
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                            >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName> followers. The organization&apos;s
                    newspaper had recently defended their decision to deny membership to a new
                    African American group in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013848"

                        >Indiana</region></placeName>. Specifically, Charles challenged the Sons of
                    Temperance to give &quot;a single good reason&quot; why African Americans could
                    not form their own chapter.<hi rend="sup">52</hi></p>

                <p>A representative of the group responded, attempting to put the subject to rest,
                    but his answer appeared, at the very least, evasive: African Americans were not
                    accepted into the Sons of Temperance for the same reason they were not accepted
                    as equals in the larger society—for the sake of &quot;peace and harmony.&quot;
                    To Charles, such an explanation was &quot;essentially bad and worthless ... not
                    susceptible of any valid defense.&quot; Presbyterian churches did not deny
                    African Americans &quot;of suitable piety&quot; membership, nor was their
                    ministry closed to anyone who was qualified. When African Americans were not
                    made to feel welcome, Charles argued, it was because of &quot;the wicked
                    prejudice of color&quot;: <quote rend="blockquote">Deprived of their vote in

                    question of maintaining &quot;peace and harmony&quot; back to the writer: <quote
                        rend="blockquote">[I]t must mean that the belligerent dispositions of some

                        of animals...This is a strange confession to be made concerning an order

                <p>Charles may often have felt &quot;a minority of self alone&quot; in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne"
                            >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName>. His growing passion to correct the
                    world and his increasing courage to speak out against racial oppression were
                    nevertheless recognizable Beecher traits. It is risky to draw direct lines of
                    family influence, but undoubtedly Charles was encouraged by Edward and Henry.
                    Edward&apos;s defense of Elijah Lovejoy and his commitment to total abolition in
                    the early 1840s had made him a family maverick as well as a national leader.
                    After moving in 1847 to Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, Henry was vaulted to the
                    forefront of the abolition movement as well. As he gained national headlines for
                    leading efforts to buy slaves their freedom and to harbor fugitives, he became
                    the target of proslavery mobs. Plymouth Church was burned in January 1849,
                    rallying massive public support and funds for rebuilding. Historians have
                    frequently remarked that the Beechers&apos; unusual family loyalty drew them
                    together and strengthened them. Was it merely by chance that Charles spoke out
                    against racism in the same period in which Henry was taking on national
                    leadership in the antislavery cause?<hi rend="i">54</hi></p>

                            >Fort Wayne</settlement></placeName> are also inevitable. His earliest
                    contacts probably came via his sister Harriet and her husband Calvin Stowe. In a
                    letter to Frederick Douglass in 1851, asking for his help writing <hi rend="i"
                        >Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin</hi>, Harriet emphasized her family&apos;s lifelong
                    commitment to ending slavery. As children, she wrote, she and her siblings had
                    frequently been moved to tears by Lyman&apos;s prayers and sermons for the
                    deliverance of American slaves. &quot;Every brother I have has been in his
                    sphere a leading Anti-Slavery man,&quot; she wrote. Harriet also described how
                    she and Calvin were active in helping fugitive slaves during their many years in
                    Cincinnati: <quote rend="blockquote">As for myself and my husband, we have for

                    years old, provides a personal record of involvement in helping slaves. In
                    response to queries sent out by Wilbur Siebert, an early historian of the

                    knowledge&quot; of the network. The only incident he could recall was when, as a
                    student at Lane Theological Seminary, he had helped Calvin Stowe drive a young
                    black woman to a station of the underground railroad north of

                    a moral imperative to support fugitive slaves coming through the area. His
                    emphasis on love of neighbor as self may have extended to helping the fugitives.
                    Clearly, he used stories in the Bible as metaphors for the moral obligations of
                    Christians. In his May 1848 report to the AHMS, he made an oblique reference to
                    underground railroad work. After listing a number of challenges that had come to
                    a head the previous year, he wrote &quot;Besides Sunday matters
                    underground.&quot; It is reasonable to believe that involvement with the
                    underground railroad was then very much on his mind.<hi rend="sup">57</hi></p>

                    the work of aiding fugitive slaves, he drew supporters into the cause. Writing
                    in 1896, Beaver looked back upon the financial support that he and other

                <p>While records may never surface linking him to the underground railroad in Fort
                    Wayne, what matters most was Charles Beecher&apos;s growing courage to serve as
                    a moral spokesman for his day. He was fortunate to have the support of a family
                    of freethinkers and moral leaders. He was also fortunate to have a diverse
                    congregation that avoided quarrelling religious factions and believed in social
                    justice and a free pulpit. Ultimately, however, Charles drew upon his own

                    Finally, Charles took what has been described as his &quot;most divisive
                    act&quot; on December 23, 1860. On December 14, President James Buchanan had
                    called for a national &quot;day of humiliation, fasting, and prayer&quot; to
                    take place January 4, 1861. The president sought to &quot;restore the friendship
                    and good will&quot; which had existed between northern and southern states and
                    urged northern anti-slavery advocates to forgo their &quot;false pride of
                    opinion.&quot; Characteristically, Charles not only preached against compliance
                    to the proclamation, but also led his congregation in writing resolutions that
                    charged that the &quot;president of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                    conspiracy with rebels to overthrow the government.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                    >61</hi></p>
                <p>In these same years, Charles would help Harriet write passages describing slavery
                    that were essential to her epic novel <hi rend="i">Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin</hi>;
                    he would be her companion, manager, and spokesperson on her triumphal European
                    tour as the world&apos;s most famous author. His father&apos;s voluminous life
                    story would be entrusted to him to compile and edit. He would again endure the
                    rebuke of theologians who considered his theology unsound and heretical. He
                    would suffer the death of children, personal illness, and poverty. While he
                    never soared to the heights of popular oratory and writing achieved by Henry and
                    Harriet, through his own battles of words he kindled and ignited the
                    nation&apos;s conscience. He argued for a free pulpit, and when his denomination
                    questioned his theology, he kept the support of his congregations.</p>
                <p>Finally, Charles Beecher could find solace in looking back on his years as a
                    missionary at Fort Wayne&apos;s Second Presbyterian Church. As he wrote to the
                    AHMS in late 1848, these were years significant in ways that he could never
                    fully appreciate. &quot;The process thru which I am passing &amp; gradually
                    conducting my people is one which must ultimately yield harvests. Even tho I
                    should not be permitted to reap them.&quot; He had awakened the minds and
                    captured the hearts of his first congregation. He had opened a path that he
                    would continue to follow in the years leading up to the Civil War. This was no
                    small accomplishment.<hi rend="sup">62</hi></p>

                    story of the Indiana Seminary Charter of 1820. The charter&apos;s story,
                    however, is not only basic to the foundation narrative of Indiana University but
                    also an important part of the state&apos;s early history. When told at all, the
                    story relates that the state constitution, the charter, and the origins of the
                    university proceeded, one from the other, along a clear path of historical
                        development.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It is a story that seems direct as well as
                    clear, like so many other narratives with which we explain the past.</p>
                <p>Societies construct explanatory narratives from different kinds of stories, based
                    on research, tradition, or imagination. For the past century it has been
                    accepted that in 1806 Parson Mason Locke Weems constructed the story of young
                    George Washington and a cherry tree for the fifth edition of his biography, thus
                    enlivening the narrative to meet competing biographies of the first president.
                    The story was intended to illustrate Washington&apos;s lifelong nobility of
                    character, but the artifice reveals Weems rather than Washington.<hi rend="sup"

                    ultimately became venerable. In the 1880s, when writers first seriously
                    considered Indiana University&apos;s past, they found the story of visionary
                    pioneers who created an educational ladder, for which-in Thomas D. Clark&apos;s
                    1970 phrase-the charter represented &quot;the bottom rail.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                        >4</hi> In this narrative, the 1816 state constitution provided a mandate
                    and the 1820 seminary charter provided legislative authority for a university.
                    In 1828, the legislature raised the seminary to a college, and one decade later
                    the college became Indiana University.</p>
                <p>Until the 1880s, however, the university gave little thought to the charter. In
                    its early years, the school was concerned with survival rather than history, for
                    it was not a place of consequence. A lawsuit in the 1850s nearly ended the
                        institution.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> A fire in 1854 destroyed its one building,
                    along with its library and records. The Civil War reduced enrollment to a mere
                    handful of students. In 1867, the first small state subsidy began a cycle of
                    biennial legislative reviews and biennial fears of removal to the state&apos;s
                    bustling capital. Enrollment remained low, about one-quarter that of the Indiana

                    seemed uncertain, and talk of removal continued intermittently until the
                    1920s.</p>
                <p>During the mid-1880s, circumstances caused the institution to reinvent itself,
                    and, in the process, to look for its origin. In part this search attempted to
                    secure the institution against the biennial threat of removal. Indiana
                    University in 1880 was in effect a classical college with <list type="footnotes">

                    a scientist-president. Two factors forced this dramatic shift. In summer 1883, a
                    second fire destroyed the grandly designated &quot;scientific building&quot; but
                    left the smaller &quot;literary building&quot; constructed after the 1854 fire.
                    The trustees made a bold decision to move from the site designated in the 1820
                    charter, one-half mile south of the town square, to a larger site one-half mile

                    scientific teaching—Wylie and Owen Halls—and supplemented them with a small

                    and led by a modern academic with an international scientific reputation,
                    Indiana University was no longer a static classical college but an expanding
                        university.<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                <p>These events uprooted the institution, and the new campus opened in 1885 without
                    a sense of history. New buildings smelled of fresh lumber and plaster.
                    University students abandoned the old college&apos;s traditions. A generation of
                    younger faculty with modern academic training replaced aging classicists, mostly
                    ministers who had taught for decades. Jordan revised the curriculum, turning
                    from the traditional study of mathematics and ancient languages to a modern
                    emphasis on science and modern languages. To some longtime staff, the pace of
                    change was breathtaking, as senior faculty member Theophilus Wylie, nephew of
                    the first Indiana College president Andrew Wylie, wrote in his diary: &quot;New
                    arrangements, new studies, new teachers, new modes of teaching, give me much
                        anxiety.&quot;<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Faced with so much change, the trustees
                    sought to anchor the institution with a foundation date. Looking back into the
                    school&apos;s history, the trustees declared that, although the college had not
                    become a university until 1838, the first state constitution had intended the
                    seminary to grow into the state university and, thus, that the Indiana Seminary
                    Charter of 1820 marked the foundation of Indiana University.</p>
                <p>The trustees marked their new sense of the university&apos;s history by
                    celebrating the first &quot;foundation day&quot; on January 20, 1889, with an
                    assembly in the old college chapel on the original campus. It included hours of
                    Victorian oratory, and one of the speakers was Judge David D. Banta, trustee and
                    1855 law graduate, who spoke about &quot;the seminary period.&quot; After the
                    first chapel exercises, students and faculty marched to the new campus almost a
                    mile away for more oratory. For the next five years, on each foundation day,
                    Banta carried his story of the institution forward until he reached the Civil
                        War.<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p>

                    destroyed. This substantial work was published in 1890. At about the same time,
                    James A. Woodburn, an 1872 graduate and faculty member, published his Johns
                    Hopkins doctoral dissertation on the history of higher education in

                            >Indiana</region></placeName>. Wylie and Woodburn agreed with their

                    narrative persisted well into the twentieth century. In 1940, Woodburn published
                    a history of the university as far as 1902, but the first six chapters merely
                    reprinted Banta&apos;s foundation-day lectures. Clark, in his three-volume
                    sesquicentennial history, likewise accepted Banta&apos;s judgment.<hi rend="sup"

                    physician David Maxwell. Indeed, he was a lobbyist for the charter, then a
                    trustee and state legislator. It was he who persuaded the legislature in 1828 to
                    charter the seminary as a college and a decade later as a university. Until his
                    death in 1854 he was a presence on the campus. Banta, who remembered him with
                    great respect, must have listened to Maxwell&apos;s version of the foundation
                    narrative many times. Maxwell&apos;s son James succeeded him on the board until
                    his own death in 1891, and it is reasonable to infer that he reiterated his
                    father&apos;s story. The elder Maxwell&apos;s memory was enshrined that same
                    year, when the university&apos;s new library, its third modern building, opened
                    and was named Maxwell Hall. Banta, Wylie, and Woodburn all wrote their histories
                    at a time when the university was under James Maxwell&apos;s watchful eye, and
                    it was perhaps natural that their narratives emphasized his father&apos;s
                    founding role and assumed that constitution, seminary, and university were
                    neatly aligned.</p>
                <p>Such assumptions beg questions of the charter&apos;s background and context, as
                    well as of the legislature&apos;s intent. Questions about the early
                    nineteenth-century narrative do not reflect on today&apos;s institution, but as
                    a point of history it is interesting to revisit the narrative and examine its
                    construction.</p>

                    university&apos;s future location while serving as rangers during the War of
                    1812. One of the four companies commissioned by Territorial Governor William
                    Henry Harrison was under the command of Judge Williamson Dunn; Dunn&apos;s
                    brother-in-law, David Maxwell, then in Madison, joined the company as surgeon,
                    and his brother Edward as a ranger. The company mustered at Madison and spent a

                    important, for as one of the rangers wrote: &quot;The soldiers became much
                    attached to each other during their service, and the kindest feeling towards

                <p> As of 1816, after the territory&apos;s population had met the 60,000 minimum
                    required under the 1787 Northwest Ordinance for statehood, Parks and his fellow
                    rangers found themselves residents of the new state of <placeName><region

                    >Indiana</region></placeName>. The Land Ordinance of 1785 had included a proviso
                    that one mile-square section of each township&apos;s thirty-six be reserved for
                    support of public schools.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Two years later, the drafters
                    of the Northwest Ordinance iterated the purpose: &quot;[R]eligion, morality, and
                    knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind,
                    schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.&quot; The
                    sentiment was Thomas Jefferson&apos;s, even if the future founder of the
                    University of Virginia did not write this particular expression. At the same
                    time, in 1787, Congress agreed to a second form of grant, which resulted from a
                    land speculator&apos;s strategy rather than congressional policy. The result,
                    nonetheless, had implications for the entire Northwest Territory. Manasseh
                    Cutler represented the Ohio Company and was engaged in negotiations with
                    Congress over his company&apos;s land purchase. He was a Yale graduate, an
                    all-round polymath known to members of Congress, a visionary. He demanded and
                    received two townships, which he required to be located at the center of the
                    company&apos;s purchase, for support of a university. By 1795 the company began
                    to survey the townships; in 1801 the town of <placeName><settlement type="city"

                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007564" reg="New Hampshire"

                    precedent. Although Maxwell was not involved in drafting the article, his
                    granddaughter Louise would later describe him as &quot;an active participant in
                    the framing of a constitution,&quot; a man to whom &quot;vision had come,&quot;
                    and of whom &quot;it is known from his subsequent life that Article IX lay

                    provisions.</p>
                <p>In its final form, the constitution&apos;s education article was complex. It gave
                    a future general assembly &quot;the duty ... as soon as circumstances will
                    permit, to provide by law for a general system of education, ascending in a
                    regular gradation, from township schools to a state university, wherein tuition
                    shall be gratis, and equally open to all.&quot; The convention also reflected
                    the prevailing rationale for public education: &quot;Knowledge and
                    learning&quot; were &quot;essential to the preservation of a free government,
                    and spreading the opportunities and advantages of education through the various
                    parts of the country [was] highly conducive to this end.&quot; The document also
                    recommended that the legislature encourage &quot;the promotion and improvement
                    of arts, sciences, commerce, manufactures, and natural history.&quot;<hi
                        rend="sup">31</hi> One can infer from the phrase &quot;ascending in a
                    regular gradation&quot; that the convention assumed future legislatures would
                    first establish township schools—public schools—throughout &quot;the various
                    parts&quot; of the state. The original draft of the constitution said nothing
                    about a seminary, but the convention members made amendments. Article IX had
                    read that &quot;no lands granted for the use of schools, shall be sold by the
                    authority of this state, prior to&quot; an unnamed year. The convention
                    delegates filled in &quot;1820,&quot; and the article was &quot;further amended,
                    by adding, after the word &apos;schools,&apos; these words, &apos;or seminaries
                    of learning.&apos;&quot;<hi rend="sup">32</hi></p>
                <p>At first, Gov. Jonathan Jennings supported the convention&apos;s mandate in
                    Jeffersonian terms. In his first message to the state legislature on November 7,
                    1816, he proclaimed the &quot;dissemination of useful knowledge&quot; to be
                    &quot;indispensably necessary as a support to morals and as a restraint to
                    vice&quot; and urged &quot;the plan of education as prescribed by the
                    constitution.&quot; A year later he asked specifically for &quot;a system of
                    common schools throughout the inhabited portion of our state&quot; so that all
                    citizens might be able to educate their children &quot;to estimate the value of
                    our free institutions. &quot;<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>

                    vicinity began to increase in value. In October, special commissioners Jonathan
                    Jennings, Benjamin Parke, and Lewis Cass concluded the agreements by which
                    native tribes relinquished claim to the central part of <placeName><region

                    commissioners appointed Parke as agent to sell town lots. The county seat lay
                    only one-half-mile north of the seminary township that he had helped select two

                    an area of thin soil and inadequate water. Parke had to be familiar with the

                    suitable for agriculture. If some woodland-based businesses developed, the
                    village nevertheless failed to become a commercial location, even into the

                    judge&apos;s ahistorical constructions, for he imagined &quot;the people&quot;
                    selected Maxwell, although he admitted there was &quot;no record ... not even a

                <p>Governor Jennings played an important role in creating the seminary as an
                    institution apart from <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808"

                    had the option of supporting the moribund Vincennes University with the new
                    township. A dozen years earlier, as a new arrival in the territory, Jennings had
                    been appointed clerk to the Vincennes trustees. Factions on the university board
                    divided between federalists, such as Governor Harrison and Parke, and
                    republicans, such as Badollet and Ewing. Jennings was a republican whom Harrison
                    had maneuvered out of office, and he was thereafter hostile to the governor and
                    to the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018808" reg="Vincennes"
                            >Vincennes</settlement></placeName> university. The squabble between the
                    two men had consequences as the years passed, when Jennings became the
                    territory&apos;s congressional delegate, then president of the constitutional
                    convention, and finally the state&apos;s first governor. Dorothy Riker, making
                    careful use of terms, has concluded that &quot;the later location of the state
                    seminary at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"

                            >Vincennes</settlement></placeName> may have resulted from this
                        animosity.&quot;<hi rend="sup">54</hi></p>
                <p>Parke&apos;s association with Governor Jennings in 1820 was probably a pragmatic
                    one. As a member of the Vincennes University board, Parke, along with other
                    trustees, had unsuccessfully sought congressional approval to sell the reserved

                <p>Speculation and politics, as the phrase has it, were inextricably intertwined.
                    Jennings&apos;s address to the legislature on December 7, 1819, suggests
                    Maxwell&apos;s influence. The governor&apos;s addresses to prior sessions had
                    urged enactment of the constitution&apos;s mandate to establish common schools,
                    an obvious need, but in 1819 he emphasized a remotely located seminary, a less
                    obvious need. Other matters in that panic year might have seemed more important
                    than a state seminary. The governor described &quot;the situation of the country
                    at large&quot; as &quot;embarrassed&quot; and implied that the state
                    &quot;required more of the fostering interposition of legislative support.&quot;
                    Yet he recommended the seminary as a legislative priority. In terms reflecting
                    Maxwell&apos;s views, he recommended that &quot;the seminary township, situated
                    in <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002678" reg="Monroe">Monroe
                            County</region></placeName>, would afford a site combining the
                    advantages of fertility of soil with a healthy climate, as well as a position
                    sufficiently central to the various sections of the State.&quot; Here was
                    another construction of historical truth: the township was to provide funds for
                    an educational institution but was not required to be that institution&apos;s
                    site. Perhaps revealing the reasoning behind the recommendation, the governor
                    candidly noted that &quot;the location of such institution upon or near such
                    lands, would ... greatly enhance their value.&quot;<hi rend="sup">56</hi></p>

                    the time. The petition represented landowners who realized that the legislature

                    system of education, and the reserved township of land in <placeName><region

                <p>The bill encountered difficulty in the senate, and the delayed vote resulted in a

                    with the ayes. Passed with a one-vote margin and signed by the governor, the law
                    was hardly a ringing endorsement for a seminary in the wilderness. Maxwell and
                    friends, however, now had authority to place the institution on the reserved

                <p>The Indiana Seminary Charter, without defining a seminary or declaring its
                    purpose, did enumerate procedures. Section one stipulated that &quot;Charles
                    Dewey, Jonathan Lindley, David H. Maxwell, John W. Jenkins, Jonathan Nichols,
                    and William Lowe, be...appointed trustees.&quot; Unfortunately, at least three
                    of the trustees were in probable conflict of interest with their responsibility
                    to select a site for the benefit of the entire state: Lindley possessed

                    and Jonathan Nichols was town surveyor and speculator. Section two required

                    and proceed to select an eligible and convenient site.&quot; The act now
                    required that the institution be built on the reserved township, even though the

                    final action, they appointed another ranger and landowner, James Borland, as
                    agent and surveyor for the seminary. They described the site as &quot;on a

                    location in 1885. Another three or four hundred yards east and west stood small
                    hills, impressive sites on which buildings might have been erected; the Indiana
                    College&apos;s first president, Wylie, built a fine house on one of the
                    hillsides that overlooked town and campus. Banta excused the trustees for not
                    selecting a better site, explaining that the summer landscape was
                    &quot;enveloped in shaggy thickets of green.&quot;<hi rend="sup">66</hi></p>
                <p>At this point Maxwell revealed his political guile. His trustees&apos; report
                    began by quoting the constitution&apos;s ninth article: the state should
                    establish &quot;a general system of education, ascending in regular gradation,
                    from township schools to a state university.&quot; A member of the
                    constitutional convention but not of the education committee, Maxwell
                    nevertheless proceeded to deconstruct that committee&apos;s work and alter its
                    meaning. He wrote: &quot;[T]he constitution of our state contemplates this
                    institution as gradually rising from the humble grade of a seminary, in which
                    the elementary parts of an education can be had, to that of a full grown
                    university, in which everything appertaining to science shall be
                        taught.&quot;<hi rend="sup">67</hi> The constitution had not, as we have
                    seen, contemplated the seminary charter; the seminary charter had not
                    contemplated the university. Maxwell had, in the phrase of a later time, pulled
                    a fast one.</p>
                <p>In 1822, the legislature received a report from David Caswell of the committee
                    &quot;to prepare a bill for a regular system of education.&quot; The report,
                    which makes clear that the legislature did not contemplate the seminary&apos;s
                    rise to a university, is &quot;one of the truly fascinating documents in
                    American social and cultural history,&quot; according to Clark.<hi rend="sup"
                        >68</hi> It is as thoughtful, long-range, and bereft of speculative concerns
                    as Maxwell&apos;s report is narrow and self-serving. Caswell directed most of
                    his extensive report to the development of township common schools throughout
                    the state. His committee proposed a statewide system in accord with Article IX
                    of the constitution, and township schools were the obvious need. Not until the
                    end of the long report did Caswell mention the word university: &quot;With

                    future institution. Caswell&apos;s committee projected a system of education
                    consistent with the constitution&apos;s mandate, beginning with township common
                    schools and eventually including a state university that the legislature would
                    charter as a university and place in the hands of qualified trustees.<hi
                        rend="sup">69</hi> The report does not draw the seminary into the proposed
                    system but ignores it entirely.</p>
                <p>By 1828, only three years after the seminary began teaching a dozen boys, David
                    Maxwell could persuade legislators that the 1816 constitution had contemplated
                    both the 1820 seminary charter and the school&apos;s rise to a collegiate
                    institution. His narrative inserted the institution into the very origins of the
                    state and linked constitution, seminary, and college into a seamless
                    development. His narrative also made a university in <placeName><settlement

                            >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> unthinkable. Much in the spirit
                    of Parson Weems, Maxwell constructed a story that privileged his narrative, and
                    in turn his narrative truth became the daughter of time.</p>
                <p>When Banta searched for Indiana University&apos;s origins in the late 1880s, he
                    remembered Maxwell&apos;s narrative, which he further arranged to say that the
                    legislature (not the constitutional convention) had planted the germ for the
                    university. He elaborated that President Madison personally selected the
                    reserved township in 1816, thus disguising the forward role of the committee of
                    the constitutional convention. Banta may not have believed it necessary to
                    promote Caswell&apos;s work, for he had almost certainly heard the prevailing
                    story during his student days from Maxwell himself, and later, for decades, from
                    Maxwell&apos;s son James.</p>
                <p>Maxwell&apos;s narrative of necessity ignored the Caswell report, but in 1822
                    most legislators doubtlessly believed that, as the report outlined, a future
                    legislature would locate the University of Indiana in newly planned

                        rend="sup">3</hi> But a handful of editors opposed the Klan. Among them,
                    Muncie&apos;s George R. Dale and his <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> were
                    notable for engaging in an all-out editorial war with the hooded order and its

                    and ridiculing its silly rituals and anti-Catholic rhetoric.</p>
                <p>Although Dale&apos;s crusade against the KKK was undeniably courageous and
                    justified, some accounts of the Klan&apos;s acts of retribution against him have
                    been embellished so greatly that they oversimplify Dale&apos;s relationship with
                    his community and mask his real accomplishments. Many of the embellishments can
                    be traced to efforts to rally support for the embattled editor; others are the
                    result of later observers misunderstanding the nature of the 1920s Indiana
                    Klan.</p>
                <p>Dale&apos;s fight against the Klan gained national media attention in 1923, after
                    he accused Delaware County Circuit Court Judge Clarence Dearth of being a
                    Klansman. He further charged that Dearth had illegally stacked juries to favor
                    Klan defendants and had given light sentences to Klansmen convicted in his
                    court. In response to the articles in the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi>, the
                    judge found Dale in indirect contempt of court in March 1923, sentenced him to
                    90 days in jail and a $500 fine, and told the left-leaning editor that if he
                    didn&apos;t like <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"

                    Dale&apos;s comments about his court hearing, published in the next week&apos;s
                    paper, so angered the judge that he found Dale in direct contempt and doubled
                    his jail time.<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                <p>Dale appealed his case to the Indiana Supreme Court, which rejected his defense
                    that publishing truthful information about a government official could not be

                    his house in 1926. The stories left the impression that, as the <hi rend="i"

                    for Dale and the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> &quot;until the Ku Klux Klan

                    but he refused. Accordingly, he met with adventure [the beating] a few nights
                    later.&quot; The <hi rend="i">Baltimore Sun</hi> described the lead-up to the
                    beating with the same tone: &quot;Dale turned his attention to the Klan, the
                    organizers of which were enrolling citizens so fast that they ran out of
                    nightgowns three times. His pen drips vitriol as he writes and there is no

                    Dale reprinted anti-Klan articles from national publications and exposed local

                <p>About four months into Dale&apos;s anti-Klan campaign, and seven months after he
                    and his son were attacked, Dale began to claim, publicly and explicitly, that
                    the March 1922 assault was linked to the Klan. He reported that police believed
                    a car used in the attack belonged to a man who had been brought to town to
                    organize the Klan. As time passed, Dale became more certain his attackers were
                    Klansmen, noting that southern Klansmen sometimes wore black hoods. Dale later
                    changed his description of his assailants from &quot;assassins in black
                    mask&quot; to &quot;hooded ruffians.&quot;<hi rend="sup">26</hi></p>
                <p>A second widely reported attack occurred in 1926, when bullets were fired into
                    Dale&apos;s house, narrowly missing his family. Although some writers have
                    linked the shooting to the Klan, it came after the Klan had lost most of its
                    influence in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2532044" reg="Muncie"
                            >Muncie</settlement></placeName>. A week after the shooting, the <hi
                        rend="sup">Post-Democrat</hi> carried a story indicating that
                    anti-Catholicism was still afflicting Hoosier politics even though the Klan was
                    no longer in vogue. Dale himself wrote that the shooting was the work of
                    &quot;protected bootleggers and rum runners&quot; who had befriended his
                    archenemies in the Williams political machine. The shooting came as Dale was
                    engaged in a heated expose of <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_2532044" reg="Muncie">Muncie</settlement></placeName>&apos;s

                <p>Claims that the Klan retaliated against the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> by
                    scaring off advertisers and subscribers are also suspect. While Dale was
                    appealing for donations, he claimed that the Klan had cost him most of his
                    readers. Yet, on May 30, 1924, after months of fierce attacks on the Klan, Dale

                    trouble selling advertisement for his earlier paper, the <hi rend="i">Muncie
                        Post</hi>, and the paper had failed. Dale also enjoyed little success in
                    finding advertisers for the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi>. Before the Klan
                    came to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>, Dale accused merchants of not advertising
                    in the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> &quot;because of the paper&apos;s
                        politics.&quot;<hi rend="sup">30</hi> In July 1921, the four-page paper had
                    on average only one larger ad (approximately three columns wide by eight inches
                    tall), two midsized (two-column) ads, and about twelve small, one-column ads for
                    local movies, eateries and other businesses. In July 1922, immediately after the
                    start of Dale&apos;s anti-Klan reporting, the number of ads in the <hi rend="i"
                        >Post-Democrat</hi> remained at about the same low level. In July 1923, in
                    the middle of the most ferocious of the Klan coverage, advertising in the
                    newspaper was down slightly, averaging less than one large, three midsize, and
                    five small ads per issue. Dale now offered a new reason for his ad sales
                    problems, complaining that &quot;merchants hesitated to advertise in the <hi
                        rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> for fear of a Klan boycott.&quot; He encouraged
                    readers to come to the aid of the paper, and at least one did, signing the ads
                    &quot;a friend and well wisher.&quot;<hi rend="sup">31</hi> As the paper&apos;s
                    expose of the Klan continued into 1924, the year in which a Klansman was elected
                    governor of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> but also the year the Midwest was hit by a
                    major recession, July statistics show advertising still down, averaging one
                    large or midsized ad and three small ones per issue. In July 1925, after the
                    arrest of D. C. Stephenson on murder charges and at the beginning of the decline
                    of the Muncie Klan, advertising increased somewhat to an average of one large
                    ad, three mid-sized ads and three small ads. Even though statewide membership in
                    the Klan was dropping rapidly by 1926, in July of that year advertising shrank
                    to an average of two large ads, one midsized ad, and no small ads. Often one of
                    the large ads was from the state Democratic Party. The July 22, 1926, paper had
                    no display ads at all, although, as Martin Schwartz noted, &quot;By the
                    beginning of 1926 the Klan was mentioned only sporadically in the <hi rend="sup"

                <p>At no time before or during Dale&apos;s fight with the Klan would advertising and
                    circulation income alone have been enough to sustain a profitable paper. The <hi
                        rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> derived much of its income from publishing legal
                    notices. Even though <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                            reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> law required governmental
                    agencies to place ads in both Republican and Democratic papers, Dale had to
                    fight to get this advertising. When he started the <hi rend="i"
                        >Post-Democrat</hi>, many county and township officials refused to recognize
                    the paper, preferring to place their ads in Muncie&apos;s two Republican papers.
                    Twice, Dale had to get court orders forcing them to advertise with him.</p>
                <p>Two more attempts were made to keep these lucrative legal notices away from the
                        <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi>. After Dale refused to endorse the
                    party&apos;s candidate for mayor in 1921, some angry Democrats tried to oust him
                    from the party and start a &quot;real&quot; Democratic paper that would qualify
                    for the legal notices. Dale claimed they were receiving support from the
                    Republican political machine. That alternative paper did not materialize in
                    1921, but in spring 1924 another publisher succeeded in launching a second
                    Democratic paper. Most county officials—all Republicans—<pb n="392"
                        id="VAA4025-106-4-076"/>switched their legal ads to it. Dale claimed that
                    the paper received support from some Democrats, Williams and his Republican
                    supporters, and the Klan. It ceased publication in August 1924, but not before
                    costing Dale, by his own accounts, thousands of dollars.<hi rend="sup"
                    >33</hi></p>
                <p>Ironically, Judge Dearth, one of Dale&apos;s biggest enemies, indirectly gave him
                    and his paper a major economic boost. The judge&apos;s jail sentence in the
                    contempt-of-court case had provoked state and national newspaper
                    editors—Republican and Democratic—to rail against the court rulings and to
                    portray Dale as a hero of press freedom. With all the positive publicity, the
                        <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi>&apos;s advertising revenue exploded. By July
                    1927, each issue averaged one large ad, seven mid-size ads, and thirty small
                    ads. The newspaper&apos;s circulation hit 18,000. Schwartz, in the first
                    scholarly assessment of Dale, concluded that all the national support caused
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2532044" reg="Muncie"
                            >Muncie</settlement></placeName> residents to reconsider Dale and his
                    paper: &quot;The people were beginning to wonder whether something should not be
                    done to &apos;make it all up&apos; to Dale for the suffering he had received in
                    their midst.&quot;<hi rend="sup">34</hi> In 1929, Dale, who had claimed that his
                    fight with the Klan had left him friendless, was elected mayor of
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2532044" reg="Muncie"
                            >Muncie</settlement></placeName> with a record number of votes. His
                    popularity, however, was short-lived. As mayor, he battled with both Democratic
                    and Republican council members and plunged the city into a costly legal dispute
                    when he fired the police and fire departments because he believed they had
                    campaigned against him.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> He sought re-election but lost in
                    the Democratic primary. His legal problems continued. He was indicted for
                    criminal libel and convicted on a federal violation-of-prohibition charge, which
                    concluded in a pardon by President Franklin Roosevelt, who was convinced that
                    witnesses had committed perjury.</p>

                    antagonist, then what explains the physical and financial attacks on Dale? The
                    truth is that well before the Klan came to town, Dale already had a long list of
                    powerful enemies. When George Dale moved to <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_2532044" reg="Muncie">Muncie</settlement></placeName>, the city
                    had a reputation as a wide-open place where political leaders and police
                    officers took money not to notice the city&apos;s large red-light district,
                    gambling halls, &quot;Cocaine Alley,&quot; and &quot;blind pigs&quot; (taverns
                    that flouted Prohibition laws). Dale came with a reputation for supporting
                    Prohibition and opposing gambling. He had been editor of weeklies that were
                    credited with closing the saloons in nearby <placeName><settlement type="city"

                    opposition from bootleggers. He had set out to publish a pro-labor, Democratic
                    newspaper in a city dominated by anti-union industrialists and Republican
                    businessmen. Dale blamed the local business community for failing to support his

                    which ceased publication in 1918. Dale wrote that during the paper&apos;s
                    two-year existence, it &quot;was boycotted by the majority of the merchants of

                <p>When Dale launched the <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi> in 1920, members of the
                    city&apos;s Commercial Club—a predecessor to the Chamber of Commerce—warned him
                    that he should abandon the paper&apos;s pro-labor stance. He did not. In the
                    first extant edition of the paper, Dale advocated the eight-hour workday,
                    attacked the Indiana Senate for passing laws that allowed union pickets to be
                    arrested on loitering charges, and argued that big corporations had framed

                    President Warren Harding and the day&apos;s industrialists: &quot;The Harding
                    administration was placed on its pedestal of power by the criminal wealth which
                    is now starving millions in order to reduce the farmer to serfdom and the
                    working man to the position of a bond slave.&quot;<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Later
                    he wrote that the moneyed aristocrats who complained of the spread of bolshevism
                    were the &quot;real un-American anarchists.&quot; He argued for the

                <p>Civil and business leaders believed they needed to do something to improve their
                    city, and they turned to what would seem today to be a most unexpected
                    organization. Throughout <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                            reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> in the early 1920s, many city
                    leaders welcomed the Ku Klux Klan into their communities because of the Indiana
                    Klan&apos;s reputation for anti-liquor, anti-corruption, and pro-American
                    stances. A <hi rend="i">McClure&apos;s</hi> magazine article in 1924 concluded
                    that &quot;the unbiased verdict in Indiana seems to be that he [the Indiana
                    Klansman] has been, all things considered, a real factor for the betterment of
                    municipal rule.&quot;<hi rend="sup">55</hi></p>
                <p>A widely repeated rumor contended that a group of <placeName><settlement

                    invited a Klan organizer to come to the city in hopes that the Klan would target
                    Mayor Bunch and lead an effort to clean up corruption and crime. The first
                    meeting of the Muncie Klan was reportedly held in the offices of the Chamber of
                        Commerce,<hi rend="sup">56</hi> whose membership was limited to the
                    city&apos;s top business and civic leaders. It is unlikely that the Balls
                    themselves were involved with the Klan. However, Ball families were members of,
                    and donated heavily to, Muncie&apos;s small Universalist church, whose minister
                    resigned after he offended members by giving a sermon denouncing the Klan.<hi

                    Protestants in the 1920s. Its &quot;100 percent Americanism,&quot; which Dale
                    later ridiculed, was at home with the nativism which dominated much of
                    post-World War I America. Even Dale&apos;s <hi rend="i">Post-Democrat</hi>
                    reported that the influx of immigrants was acting to lower wages and &quot;smash
                    unions,&quot; and the paper criticized immigration officials for allowing

                <p>The initial membership of the Klan would have included some of Dale&apos;s most
                    resolute enemies. Many of the businessmen and civic leaders who had boycotted
                    his newspapers for their pro-labor stances and his association with Bunch were
                    now joining the secret order. County officials, mostly Republicans who had been
                    stung by Dale&apos;s sarcastic editorials, would have had ties to the
                    city&apos;s business and industrial leaders and would have been drawn to the
                    Klan. Even many Democrats had turned against Dale in 1921, after he refused to
                    endorse party nominee Bunch, who was seeking re-election despite an

                    holding office. Many of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2532044"
                            reg="Muncie">Muncie</settlement></placeName>&apos;s bootleggers, who
                    already hated Dale for his anti-liquor crusade, were well placed socially and
                    politically, and would also have reason to join the Klan.<hi rend="sup"
                    >67</hi></p>
                <p>One can conclude that the Klan brought together and emboldened Dale&apos;s
                    enemies and made life considerably harder for the publisher and his newspaper.
                    However, the assessment that the Klan was the primary cause of Dale&apos;s
                    troubles is overstated. Before the Klan came to <placeName><settlement

                    illegal liquor business had caused bootleggers to threaten and assault him and
                    to terrorize his wife. His rabidly pro-labor and leftist writings had angered

                    led them to withhold their advertising from his paper. And his attacks on the
                    Republican political machine and refusal to support the corrupt Democratic Mayor
                    Bunch had alienated him from most of the city&apos;s political figures. Given

                    Bend</settlement></placeName> who had studied both for the ministry and in sociology at the University of
                    Chicago, privately published <hi rend="i">The Negro in South Bend: A Social
                        Study</hi> as well as a sermon, &quot;The Quest of Restless Souls.&quot;
                    Originally appearing three years after incidents of large-scale violence against
                    black populations in many major cities—including nearby <placeName><settlement

                    have been recovered from the archives and reissued by Wolfson Press, which is
                    affiliated with Indiana University, South Bend&apos;s Master of Liberal Studies
                    program. The publication appears as part of Wolfson&apos;s &quot;On Their
                    Shoulders: Race Relations &amp; Civil Rights in South Bend, Indiana&quot;
                    series; as such, it is indicative of larger current trends to foster public
                    memory and discussion in the northern <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> region.</p>
                <p>Taken together, Gordon&apos;s social study and sermon offer marvelous
                    opportunities for exploring conditions in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7014320" reg="South Bend">South Bend</settlement></placeName>
                    during this particularly explosive time in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                            reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName> history. Those interested
                    in the city and its larger region will be drawn to the eclectic information
                    provided by the author, from Gordon&apos;s estimates of the numbers of black
                    workers employed at local companies and the percentages of black children
                    attending school to his chapter on the early history of African Americans in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014320" reg="South Bend"
                            >South Bend</settlement></placeName>. In the latter, the author tells
                    the story of a fugitive slave case that included local residents-black and
                    white-rallying to prevent a Kentuckian from returning home with his recaptured
                    slaves.</p>
                <p>Moreover, these two works promote the study of an especially complex aspect of
                            <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                        >U.S.</country></placeName> culture from the 1890s to World War II: the
                    relation among sociology, religion, and <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-106-4-086"/>
                    activism in the context of movements for racial equality. Gordon&apos;s texts
                    represent an amalgam of sometimes-contradictory discourses shaped into an appeal
                    for African American social, civil, and political rights. <hi rend="i">The Negro
                        in South Bend</hi> emerges from a sociological tradition that presumes that
                    the scientific study of social problems leads to effective solutions. As such,
                    the book argues that once the white community fully understands African
                    Americans&apos; struggles, they will begin to help address them. In pursuit of
                    this goal, the author weaves histories, census data, anecdotes, photographs, and
                    statistics compiled from local employers to educate readers about the challenges
                    African Americans faced in finding work, schooling, and housing.</p>
                <p>This progressive sociological narrative, however, is complicated by Gordon&apos;s
                    non-secular appeals and his assumptions about &quot;racial uplift&quot; in
                    relation to gender roles, class formation, and even global missionary projects.
                    Most notable, when comparing the book and the sermon, is the tension between
                    moderate discourses of uplift and a more radical call for structural, societal
                    change. In his book, Gordon often—though not always—moderates his tone and
                    argument, adopting the ostensibly scientific third-person voice and emphasizing
                    gradual reform, cooperation with whites, and the underlying need for jobs.
                    Without employment prospects, Gordon writes, black families will not see the
                    importance of sending their children to school. Yet these appeals also contain
                    implicit warnings to white leaders—especially employers at key local
                    manufacturers such as Studebaker, Singer, and Westinghouse who, since the end of
                    the war, had hired fewer and fewer African Americans.</p>
                <p>Although in his study Gordon asserts that &quot;there has been in no instance an
                    expressed bitterness among the different races&quot; in <placeName><settlement
                        type="city" key="tgn_7014320" reg="South Bend">South Bend</settlement></placeName> (p. 52),
                    editor David H. Healey&apos;s introduction suggests a less sanguine reality:
                    &quot;Racial competition and violence increased ... during World War I, with at
                    least one effort being made to burn a large black boarding house while its
                    residents slept&quot; (p. 6). In such a context, Gordon&apos;s sermon presents a
                    more radical message for a different audience. He notes the &quot;social
                    unrest&quot; of the times, including the struggles of black workers in general,
                    especially women and soldiers returning to civilian life, and he issues a direct
                    challenge: &quot;We must have democracy for all the people,&quot; he writes,
                    &quot;or change our form of government&quot; (p. 96).</p>
                <p>The edition contains discussion questions relevant to a variety of audiences,
                    from community book groups to high school and university-level students.
                    Healey&apos;s introductory essay is buoyed by thorough research—from interviews
                    with Gordon&apos;s children to a Freedom of Information Act request for military
                    records—and offers many valuable contextual and biographical details, although
                    students and historians may be disappointed by the lack of notes and
                    bibliography.</p>
                <pb n="403" id="VAA4025-106-4-087"/>
                <p>Healey is right when he notes that Gordon&apos;s text &quot;provides a baseline
                    of research data for understanding the history of African Americans in
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014320" reg="South Bend"
                            >South Bend</settlement></placeName>&quot; (p. 14), though he perhaps
                    understates the case. <hi rend="i">The Negro in South Bend</hi> and
                    Gordon&apos;s sermon offer much more: they tell an alternate history of the
                    Great Migration; they provide primary materials with which to consider the
                    complexities and contradictions of the ideologies of racial uplift; and they
                    document struggles that might otherwise be overshadowed by larger urban
                    histories or attention to national figures such as Booker T. Washington or W E.

                <p>Of Eugene Debs&apos;s five presidential runs, the 1920 campaign arguably had the
                    most lasting impact. That year, running as Convict No. 7653 in the Atlanta
                    Federal Penitentiary, he found himself at the center of a national debate over
                    free speech.</p>
                <p>The story of Debs&apos;s 1918 arrest in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7013537" reg="Canton">Canton</settlement></placeName>,
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"
                            >Ohio</region></placeName>, for allegedly violating federal law by
                    advocating insubordination and obstruction of the draft, is a standard feature
                    in Debs biographies. Even surveys of the World War I era almost invariably
                    mention his arrest, though few of these do more than treat his candidacy as an
                    oddity. Ernest Freeburg, however, puts Debs&apos;s arrest, trial, incarceration,
                    and the campaign for his release at the center of the era&apos;s bitter national
                    debate over the nature of free speech.</p>
                <p>Debs did not set out to put himself in this position. His statements were no more
                    extreme than those made by many others, and considerably less than some. When he
                    spoke at <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013537" reg="Canton"
                            >Canton</settlement></placeName>, many critics of the war had been
                    arrested and jailed. Some even had successfully fought similar charges.</p>
                <p>But this was Gene Debs, whose arrest was sure to provoke interest. It met with
                    widespread approval in the hyperpatriotic wartime atmosphere, even from many who
                    formerly had a good opinion of the man, if not of his politics. But from the
                    beginning some argued that he had been arrested for his political beliefs, not
                    because he <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-106-4-088"/> posed a threat to the nation. As
                    the months passed, from his trial in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7013608" reg="Cleveland">Cleveland</settlement></placeName> to
                    his time in Moundsville Penitentiary and then <placeName><settlement type="city"
                        key="tgn_2078285" reg="Atlanta">Atlanta</settlement></placeName>; from wartime to
                    peacetime; from the Wilson administration&apos;s dithering over a pardon or
                    other form of release to its (or, rather, President Wilson&apos;s) bitter, angry
                    decision to do nothing; through the Harding administration&apos;s delicate
                    handling of what had become the Debs Issue, Debs remained at the center of the
                    debate over wartime measures to restrict speech.</p>
                <p>While he may not have intended to provoke arrest, Debs generally embraced the
                    role of &quot;democracy&apos;s prisoner.&quot; His rhetoric became, if anything,
                    more revolutionary; he refused to ask for leniency or pardon; and he linked his
                    case to those of other, lesser known &quot;political prisoners.&quot; At the
                    same time, Debs remained the stubborn, frustratingly likable radical, winning
                    the grudging admiration of his warders and other prisoners, and slowly
                    rebuilding substantial—but not nearly universal—public sympathy.</p>
                <p>As Freeberg shows, all of this was useful to activists who had been appalled by
                    wartime restrictions like the Espionage Act. Knowing that many Americans were
                    uncomfortable with these restrictions, Lucy Robins, Roger Baldwin, Rose Stokes,
                    Max Eastman, and countless others argued, lobbied, wrote, and organized
                    tirelessly for the release of prisoners and for repudiation of the idea of
                    restrictions on speech. Having Debs as the most visible victim of wartime
                    repression was invaluable—he was unthreatening (at least to many), kind-hearted,
                    aging, and beset by medical problems (what a nightmare for a president to have
                    Debs die in prison!). Add the calming of passions after the Red Scare, which
                    Freeberg nicely details, and the beginnings of national second thoughts about
                    the war itself, and Debs&apos;s release was all but inevitable. When he left
                    prison, he may not have realized it but his political career was over. But the
                    pro-free speech attitudes and arguments developed during the fight in which he
                    was a central figure continue to shape discussion of this issue today.</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Democracy&apos;s Prisoner</hi> is a valuable contribution to the
                    literature on free speech and on Eugene Debs. Freeberg deftly moves back and
                    forth between the national struggle over speech and Debs&apos;s personal
                    experiences. His research is broad and deep, and he makes a good case for the
                    importance of Debs&apos;s imprisonment to the free speech battle. His
                    discussions of the internal debates over Debs that took place in the Wilson and
                    Harding administrations are fascinating. He also writes cleanly and smoothly,
                    even when discussing complicated legal arguments. The book is a pleasure to
                    read.</p>
                <p>Freeberg&apos;s descriptions of wartime repression vividly remind us of the
                    ugliness brought on by violations of that freedom, just as his discussion of the
                    free speech campaign reminds us that it is a freedom hard-won and never to be
                    taken for granted.</p>

                    history, <hi rend="i">An American Hometown</hi>, I was reminded of David&apos;s
                    wry rubric. The interrogative crowbar that the book inserts to pry open each of

                    for all its remote strangeness, for all these remote people occupied in these
                    bizarre and unusual tasks.</p>
                <p>As a history, there is little story. The book is all, or almost all, exposition,
                    as Roznowski expands names and occupations into a series of energetic
                    speculative essays on timely common cultural technologies, social practices, and
                    the coincidences of daily life. The effect is that of a vast museum, a cabinet
                    of wonder, its bare bones framed by intriguingly complex enabling apparati.
                    Every inch of this museum&apos;s walls is papered with ever-expanding
                    interpretive labels.</p>
                <p>Imagine a map more detailed than the thing it represents. In such a setting,
                    juxtaposition is all. The arbitrary ordering spontaneously creates valences,
                    insightfully opening up spaces for emotional response and intellectual
                    connection.</p>
                <p>This isn&apos;t &quot;story&quot; as much as anecdote on steroids. The white
                    space between each entry is a graphic invitation for the reader to participate
                    in <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-106-4-090"/> making the meaning of the text. Here,
                    the entry on Birch E. Bayh, a supervisor of physical education (annotated to
                    reflect his paternity of a future <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                        States</country></placeName> senator and grand-paternity of another senator
                    who also will serve as governor) sits right next to that of Orval W Baker, a
                    manager of the Klan Home (bulked-up by its hefty essay about the Ku Klux Klan in
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>).</p>
                <p>What to make of that? Indeed, what to make of this or that at all? Such foiling
                    often foils our chance to make any lasting sense. Roznowski instead suggests,
                    almost atmospherically, that <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014370"
                        reg="Terre Haute">Terre Haute</settlement></placeName> in 1927 represented, literally and
                    figuratively, the crossroads of <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United
                        States">America</country></placeName> and its history. The device of the city
                    directory as exploding cloud chamber allows us to map the many and varied
                    trajectories at a unique collision of time and space. His introduction argues
                    that our immediate, real-time sensation of exhaustion, our post-postmodernness,
                    can, in fact, be traced back to this moment&apos;s Big Bang, its outward vectors
                    incubating in this list of names and catalog of jobs. The picture it presents of
                    the past may therefore also be the author&apos;s portrait of our future sans
                    cheap transportation, sans massive communication, sans entertainment
                    conglomeration, sans concentration of wealth. To his credit, Roznowski
                    constructs this simulation of a city and a time with little nostalgia and with
                    much lively imaginative vision.</p>

                <p>Why would a sports writer author a book about an industrialist? Can you imagine
                    Grantland Rice writing a biography of John D. Rockefeller, or Red Smith penning
                    a tome on the life of Henry Kaiser?</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">The Bill Cook Story</hi> is as exciting as any championship series.
                    Told by a master storyteller, the narrative sweeps the reader through the
                    personal and private lives of Bill and Gayle Cook. Unknown even in their <pb

                    established and nourished one of the great companies in the medical world. They
                    preserved and restored truly valuable buildings, owned sports organizations in
                    foreign lands, developed a small transportation and insurance empire, and won a
                    national drum corps championship before bringing a long-running show to
                    Broadway.</p>
                <p>Bob Hammel is the storyteller. As the former sports editor for the
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington"
                            >Bloomington</settlement></placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Herald-Times</hi>, Hammel knows how to relate to public figures who
                    prefer to be private persons. It was Hammel who covered and befriended Bob
                    Knight, the incomparable Indiana University basketball coach, during the most
                    prominent years of Knight&apos;s career.</p>
                <p>With full access to the reclusive Cook, Hammel details the growth of Cook, Inc.
                    from its beginnings in an apartment near the <placeName><settlement type="city"
                        key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName> campus to its current
                    status as a very private enterprise with sprawling international holdings. This
                    well-illustrated biography tells the story that Bill Cook wants the world to
                    know. It is the same story told by his close associates.</p>
                <p>Now 89 years old, Cook is a coiled intellectual spring. Lanky and creased,
                    chain-smoking when I knew him, he could ask the most searing questions in the
                    quiet manner of a small-town midwestern boy. That he let Hammel so close is a
                    mark of the reporter&apos;s respect for his subject&apos;s integrity.</p>
                <p>The subtitle, <hi rend="i">Ready, Fire, Aim</hi>, refers to Bill Cook&apos;s
                    antipathy for long-term planning. He focuses on today, recognizing the
                    impossibilities of controlling the future. His single-minded (some say
                    autocratic) management style has led to some well-documented disputes with local
                    politicians in a community not known for harmonious or rational
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>Hammel shows us not just the man but something of the business, too. Cook, Inc.
                    has both benefited from and helped to lead the boom in non-invasive diagnostics
                    and surgery. The company has been part of the improvement in health care and the
                    lowering of costs which have characterized the industry over the past thirty
                    years. Yes, the lowering of costs. Today, with products like those made by Cook
                    and other high-tech medical supply firms, millions are able to afford and
                    survive procedures that would have been prohibitively expensive in the past.</p>
                <p>Some readers might shy away from a 411-page book about a midwestern manufacturer
                    of stents and catheters. They would miss the thriller tale of Gayle Cook&apos;s
                    kidnapping, the Tony and Emmy awards bestowed on Blast!, and the death-defying
                    journeys of John Mellencamp with Bill Cook at the wheel. Most of all, they would
                    deny themselves the story of the incredible restoration of the monumental West
                    Baden Springs Hotel.</p>
                <p>Bill and Gayle Cook are remarkable people. That this biography is <pb n="408"
                        id="VAA4025-106-4-092"/> friendly to them in no way diminishes its relevance
                    or accuracy. Simply put, <hi rend="i">The Bill Cook Story</hi> is a good read.
                    Maybe someday Frank DeFord will give us the definitive work on Bill Gates or
                    John Feinstein will trace the rise and fall of Bernie Madoff. </p>

                <p>In his absorbing new biography, <hi rend="i">Steve McQueen: The Great
                    Escape</hi>, Wes D. Gehring continues his role as a keen observer, a skillful
                    writer, and a genuine movie buff who openly admires the spirit of his subjects.
                    This thorough and engaging book, the latest of Gehring&apos;s Hollywood
                    biographies, recounts McQueen&apos;s humble Hoosier beginnings, his early
                    television success as a tough-guy bounty hunter, and the numerous films that
                    made him the biggest movie star of the early 1970s.</p>
                <p>Gehring begins his biography with McQueen&apos;s &quot;train wreck&quot; of a
                    childhood. Born in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031046"

                            key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, in 1934,
                    Steve McQueen never knew his father. His mother periodically abandoned the boy,
                    shrugged him off on relatives, or took up with abusive alcoholics who turned
                    their fists on him. The insecure child grew into a moody womanizer with a temper
                    and a thirst for danger.</p>
                <p>As a teen, McQueen was an incorrigible risk-taker, a poor student who suffered
                    from dyslexia and took up with <placeName><settlement type="city"
                            key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                        >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> gangs to commit petty robberies
                    &quot;as a relief from boredom&quot; (p. 13). In his early 20s, McQueen began a
                    life of acting almost by accident; he was drawn to the <placeName><settlement
                            type="city" key="tgn_7007567" reg="New York">New
                        York</settlement></placeName> stage because it allowed him to sleep late in
                    the mornings and work only a few hours at night. McQueen realized that his life
                    had already prepared him for a career as an actor; playing a variety of roles
                    had been a survival tactic for years. &quot;Acting,&quot; he once said,
                    &quot;beats stealing hubcaps&quot; (p. 24).</p>
                <p>McQueen joined peers James Dean and Marlon Brando in studying the Method
                    technique. His naturally understated style and his physical charisma brought him
                    to the attention of his teachers and casting directors. He rode the Western
                    genre to success on the small screen and, soon after, became a film star in
                    classics such as <hi rend="i">The Thomas Crown Affair</hi> and <hi rend="i">The
                        Getaway</hi>. McQueen was a hard <pb n="409" id="VAA4025-106-4-093"/>
                    worker, Gehring insists, who devoted hours to mastering his props, and the
                    actor&apos;s inclination to hide his emotions worked well for him; audiences
                    perceived McQueen as exuding a kind of troubled mystery.</p>
                <p>As Gehring takes the reader through the highlights of McQueen&apos;s career and
                    personal life, he balances discussion of the actor&apos;s harsher traits with
                    quotes from those who loved him, and provides anecdotes that reveal his
                    lesser-known humorous side. Gehring recounts, for example, the great passion
                    (and volcanic arguments) of McQueen&apos;s love affair with and eventual
                    marriage to Ali MacGraw.</p>
                <p>Steve McQueen was candid about his flaws and the reasons behind them. At the root
                    of his life story was the fact that, despite his ability to recognize the
                    deprivations that shaped him, he was unable to get out from under them. Because
                    of this, the book ends on a somewhat melancholy note. After a lifetime searching
                    for a way to prove himself and for &quot;a safe place&quot; (p. 233), McQueen
                    was unable to make peace with the pain and chaos of his early life until his
                    final years, before his death from cancer at the age of fifty.</p>
                <p>Gehring quotes McQueen as saying, &quot;I&apos;ve done everything there is to do
                    but a lot of my life was wasted&quot; (p. 205). His biographer poignantly
                    disagrees. Believing that the actor squeezed as much living into his short life
                    as possible, albeit much of it self-destructive, Gehring points to
                    McQueen&apos;s humility, talent, and devotion to his two children as the
                    star&apos;s real legacy. An unabashed fan of McQueen&apos;s great escape from
                    both his hardscrabble Indiana childhood and his life-long personal demons,
                    Gehring reminds his readers that &quot;we will always have the films&quot; (p.
                    242). Thanks to this touching and highly readable new biography, readers will
                    regret that there are so few.</p>

                <p>The theme of violence has been surging to prominence in the writing of early
                    modern American history, and these two books by senior historians <pb n="410"
                        id="VAA4025-106-4-094"/> duly place it at the heart of their reevaluations
                    of the American Revolution and the Early American Republic. T. H. Breen and
                    Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, who have enjoyed illustrious academic careers since
                    earning their doctorates in 1968, join a vibrant younger generation of scholars
                    working to counter the tenacity with which the conventional narrative of
                    American history has for so long been sanitized and distorted. Vincent Brown in
                        <hi rend="i">The Reaper&apos;s Garden: Death and Power in the World of
                        Atlantic Slavery</hi> (2008) focused on the violence in the history of
                    slavery; Patrick Griffin in <hi rend="i">American Leviathan: Empire, Nation, and
                        Revolutionary Frontier</hi> (2007), and Peter Silver in <hi rend="i">Our
                        Savage Neighbors: How Indian War Transformed Early America</hi> (2007)
                    stressed the violence on the so-called &quot;frontier.&quot; To these can now be
                    added Breen&apos;s book dramatizing the physical violence of the Revolution, and
                    Smith-Rosenberg&apos;s book interrogating the rhetorical violence of the Early
                    Republic. Both historians insist that for us to do justice to the past, these
                    foundational moments of American history must be re-appraised for their violent
                    tendencies, and for the emotionality impelling that violence.</p>
                <p>In Breen&apos;s account of the American Revolution the leading emotion is rage,
                    because only rage can explain the inexorable march toward war in the two
                    critical years preceding the War of American Independence. That war would entail
                    tremendous sacrifice and bloodshed, but before the war itself there was a
                    crucial phase of &quot;insurgency,&quot; by which Breen means organized popular
                    political resistance. In his previous book, <hi rend="i">The Marketplace of
                        Revolution: How Consumer Politics Shaped American Independence</hi> (2004),
                    Breen had sought to explain what managed to unify colonists living in the
                    thirteen disconnected yet ultimately rebellious colonies; there his answer had
                    been consumer culture and boycott politics. In this follow-up volume, Breen
                    seeks to explain what motivated diverse ordinary people to pursue revolution and
                    to wage war; his answer here is political rage. Other scholars have concentrated
                    their energy on the &quot;genius&quot; of the so-called Founding Fathers, on the
                    intellectual arguments of political pamphlets, and on the vanguard of urban
                    activism, but such an elitist approach cannot, according to Breen, explain a
                    rebellion as widespread as the American Revolution. His spotlight falls instead
                    upon the middling white farming families who constituted, in Breen&apos;s
                    estimation, 70 percent of the population in the thirteen rebellious colonies.
                    These were the proverbial ordinary people instigated by the actions of the
                    British imperial government to organize local protest committees, with the
                    unexpected and magnified consequence of fomenting a revolution and sparking a
                    war.</p>
                <p>Breen&apos;s story effectively begins with the March 1774 passage of the Coercive
                    Acts in response to the Boston Tea Party, and it ends shy of the Declaration of
                    Independence in <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-106-4-095"/> July 1776 with an
                    insurgency by then at full throttle. Breen traces the events and processes
                    through which middling white farming families living in small communities
                    throughout the thirteen rebellious colonies were awakened to political
                    consciousness and incited to political rage: these are the
                    &quot;insurgents&quot; of the book&apos;s title. Spurred into action by the
                    Coercive Acts, new protest committees forced increasingly stark choices on their
                    local communities: either you are with us or you are against us. For Breen,
                    these committees became &quot;schools of revolution&quot; which in two
                    years&apos; time managed to overthrow imperial authority in the colonies,
                    leaving King and Parliament with only an unsavory military option to restore
                    order. The committees served simultaneously to channel political rage by those
                    &quot;with us,&quot; and to stifle political dissent by those &quot;against
                    us.&quot; The emotive and unflinching intimidation of imperial officials as well
                    as &quot;friends of government&quot; (i.e., loyalists) constitutes the
                    unappreciated violence of this crucial phase of the American Revolution. Without
                    an insurgency, Breen insists, there could have been no revolution.</p>
                <p>In Smith-Rosenberg&apos;s account of the Early American Republic the leading
                    emotion is not rage but fear, because only fear can explain the venom directed
                    at social scapegoats in the two critical decades following the War of American
                    Independence. The peace treaty of 1783 left the victorious American rebels
                    without any central government or national identity to carry them securely
                    forward into the future. Because the War had disrupted every aspect of life in
                    the thirteen states, it forced an extraordinary burden of re-creation upon
                    citizens of the new nation. Hence a pervasive and abiding fear beset bourgeois
                    and middling urban whites in the postwar era, as they confronted not the
                    imperial beast of <placeName><country key="tgn_7008653" reg="Great Britain"
                            >Britain</country></placeName>, but seemingly intractable economic
                    problems and political tensions within the thirteen independent
                            &quot;<placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                            States</country></placeName>.&quot; Smith-Rosenberg&apos;s story begins
                    with the violent outbreak and military suppression of Shays&apos;s Rebellion in
                    1786 in western <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007517"
                            reg="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</region></placeName>, an episode she
                    considers symptomatic of the ongoing turmoil that would prompt middling urban
                    whites to choose to heap opprobrium on rural farmers, women, Native Americans,
                    and African Americans.</p>
                <p>Scrutinizing the political magazines and the novels of the era, Smith-Rosenberg
                    engages in both psycho-analytic interpretation as well as cultural analysis to
                    pinpoint the terms of this rhetorical violence. Bourgeois and middling urban
                    whites projected their fear and self-loathing onto weaker social
                    groups—&quot;the Other&quot;—in a bid to bolster their own fragile identities
                    and frustrated aims. They sought to construct a binary social world where
                    exclusion of the marginal would enable consolidation of a mainstream: a secure
                    new American ruling class to replace the ousted British. Yet no matter how
                    fiercely <pb n="412" id="VAA4025-106-4-096"/> political magazines demonized
                    rural farmers, women, &quot;Indians,&quot; and &quot;Africans,&quot; none of
                    this managed to produce a coherent nation, a rigid social hierarchy, or a secure
                    ruling class. The magazines&apos; images of &quot;the Other&quot; would remain
                    so riddled with ambiguities and contradictions as to undermine any sense of
                    cultural confidence or social stability for their audience. Scapegoating proved,
                    in the end, a disturbingly weak rhetorical weapon of the self-appointed new
                    American elite.</p>
                <p>In Breen&apos;s account of the American Revolution, physical violence succeeded
                    in generating an effective broad-based insurgency against the most powerful
                    empire in the world. In Smith-Rosenberg&apos;s account of the Early American
                    Republic, rhetorical violence failed to fortify a new American ruling class, one
                    which held political power but enjoyed neither confidence nor security.
                    Breen&apos;s narrative ends optimistically on the cusp of political
                    triumph—independence first declared by force of words and then defended by force
                    of arms—whereas Smith-Rosenberg&apos;s narrative ends pessimistically with a
                    fractious degree of fearfulness continuing to plague American history down to
                    the present day. Both books steer us to greater appreciation of the emotionality
                    as well as the violence endemic to two foundational periods of American history
                    where we have been led to least expect it. In so doing, Breen and
                    Smith-Rosenberg help us reconsider the peculiar terms of American history, and
                    of the &quot;American character.&quot; Are Americans essentially a violent
                    people?</p>

                <p>Stanley Hedeen has packed a great deal into one small book. This is a story about
                    a place and an American icon. Americans&apos; fascination with monstrous animals
                    that once roamed the continent, armed with massive teeth—and exemplifying
                    American power—did not begin with the dinosaurs of the nineteenth century.</p>
                <p>Fully a century earlier, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Willson
                    Peale, and a host of others, were engrossed in the study of a different
                    monster—one with ten-foot tusks. We know it today as the mastodon, a relative of
                    the living elephants of Africa and Asia and the extinct &quot;Siberian&quot;
                    mammoth (which <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-106-4-097"/> in fact lived all over the
                    northern hemisphere).</p>
                <p>The mastodon lived some 10,000 years ago; just when it became extinct is unclear,
                    but perhaps even during the human occupation of North America. The first
                    mastodon remains were found in the Hudson River Valley around 1700 and the best
                    skeletons were exhumed by Peale, artist, naturalist and showman, in
                            <placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002751" reg="Orange">Orange

                    first captured the public interest, and for decades baffled scientists, came
                    from a site just south of the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio

                            >Big Bone Lick</settlement></placeName> was a series of marshes and
                    pools, fed by springs made saline by seepage through ancient marine rocks. The
                    lick was created after the glaciers retreated and left a morass, the salt
                    attracting every kind of animal and the mud claiming victim after victim that
                    became entrapped there and preserved. The remains of twenty different large
                    mammals, from mastodon and bison to musk ox and an extinct species of horse,
                    have been found there so far.</p>

                    legends about the &quot;Great Buffalo&quot; that terrorized the region so badly
                    that &quot;the Great Man above&quot; chased the last big bull &quot;over the

                    finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day.&quot;</p>
                <p>As soon as it was agreed that the mastodon or &quot;incognitum&quot; (unknown)
                    was some kind of elephant, debate arose. Many, like Thomas Jefferson, hoped that
                    it was a ferocious carnivore. But, if it was a type of elephant, what was a
                    denizen of warm climates doing so far up in the chilly north? Had there been a
                    momentous change in climate in the past? Perhaps the earth&apos;s axis of
                    rotation had shifted. Alternatively, perhaps the remains at
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2037746" reg="Big Bone">Big
                            Bone Lick</settlement></placeName> simply represented animals drowned in
                    Noah&apos;s Flood and washed far to the north of their original habitat.</p>
                <p>Jefferson, in his magisterial Notes on the <hi rend="i">State of Virginia</hi>
                    (1785), was the first to state clearly that different kinds of elephants had
                    lived in different climates, warm or cool. But for all his prescience, Jefferson
                    could not accept that the mastodon, or any creature, had become extinct. He
                    believed, with the Shawnee, that it now lived in the far west, towards the Great
                    Stony Mountains.</p>
                <p>Hedeen tells the story of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2037746" reg="Big
                    Bone">Big Bone Lick</settlement></placeName> from all viewpoints: geological,
                    palaeontological, and human. A fascinating range of frontier types collected
                    bones at the licks. One bizarre story from the site&apos;s history was the
                    attempt to develop it into a spa, complete with resort hotel where, two
                    centuries before, Indians had forced white captives to boil salt for trade.</p>
                <p>This is a complete account, although Hedeen does not cite the letter from

                    Jefferson in 1810, reporting that the Indians had seen not only tusks, bones,

                    be fascinating to know if this were true (the first live elephant was displayed
                    in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                        >America</country></placeName> in 1797). Perhaps <placeName><settlement

                <p>Horses have only recently attracted the attention of academic historians. Within
                    a period of a few years—2006 to 2009—a sudden flurry of books has appeared,
                    particularly from academic presses, devoted to the horse and its role in society
                    from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth century centuries. <hi rend="i"
                        >Horses at Work: Harnessing Power in Industrial America</hi> is one of these
                    books. With a broad focus on the geographic area of the American Northeast and
                    Midwest (and emphasis on <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007568"

                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania"
                            >Pennsylvania</region></placeName>), Ann Norton Greene assesses the role
                    of the horse in industry, cities, and war over the nineteenth century. She deals
                    less with the type of work most commonly associated with the horse—namely,
                    farming.</p>
                <p>The book begins with an excellent and pertinent discussion of the horse&apos;s
                    traction abilities and the comparable capacity (or lack thereof) of other
                    species. The author assesses roads and their construction in light of the
                    horse&apos;s ability to pull. The advent of the steam engine enhanced the need
                    for horses, and Greene interweaves the development of transportation
                    technology—for example, the making of stagecoaches, and their wheels and shock
                    systems—with the history of the horse. Boats needed horses to pull the vessels
                    along the water from the riverside; in general, horses were so essential to the
                    functioning of a city that the widespread presence of the equine disease
                    glanders could bring business to a stand-still.</p>
                <pb n="415" id="VAA4025-106-4-099"/>
                <p>Greene&apos;s chapter on the role of the horse in the American Civil War is
                    perhaps the most valuable part of the book. Surprisingly little historical
                    material exists on horses and the military—that is, on the breeding of
                    warhorses, the purchase of the stock, and the methods of transporting the
                    animals themselves as well as the feed, saddles, harness, and shoes that they
                    required.</p>
                <p>When people appear within this horse-centered study, it is mostly as users, or
                    consumers, of the stock. The author examines what people did with the animals,
                    and how horse power fed the development of industries and various technologies.
                    Breeding theory and culture are not central to her study, although she does
                    address the issues at least briefly. Since work has been done on these topics,
                    however, the book augments the horse story in a valuable way.</p>
                <p>My most serious problems with the book are the poverty of footnotes and the lack
                    of a bibliography. Sparse documentation weakens the robustness of the
                    author&apos;s arguments and makes it hard to see the underpinning research. It
                    may be that Greene aimed this book at a general audience, but her work would be
                    more valuable if the reader could discern how it fits into the existing
                    literature, and could determine the extent of her use of primary sources.
                    Perhaps this is a minor point from someone who is deeply interested in her
                    subject. Overall, this book greatly enhances our knowledge of the working horse
                    and its essential role in society.</p>

                        Midwest</hi> is a much needed addition to the growing historiography on
                    emancipation and Reconstruction. Leslie Schwalm asserts that emancipation was
                    not confined to the South, but had consequences elsewhere. The book examines
                    those consequences in the Upper Midwest—specifically, in <placeName><region

                    Moreover, it adds to a new but growing body of work on African American history
                    in that region—literature <pb n="416" id="VAA4025-106-4-100"/> that includes

                        the Urban Midwest</hi> (2008).</p>
                <p>One of the two central goals of <hi rend="i">Emancipation&apos;s Diaspora</hi> is
                    to examine the movement and dispersal of formerly enslaved African Americans,
                    prompted by the Civil War and emancipation. Although migration long had been a
                    feature of slavery and oppression, Schwalm contends that enslaved people
                    transformed it into an &quot;avenue for liberation&quot; (p. 46). She pinpoints
                    three distinct paths of African American migration to the Upper Midwest before,
                    during, and after the Civil War—analyzing the reasons that people migrated and
                    sought refuge in temporary camps behind Union lines, the conditions they endured
                    in those camps, the impact of wartime legislation on their migration, and the
                    conscious and calculated decisions they made to settle permanently in one region
                    over another. Schwalm illustrates how certain cities such as

                    as important gateway cities in the longer journey to freedom in the North. While
                    the author adequately proves how wartime migrations accelerated the destruction
                    of slavery and made emancipation a national event, her book&apos;s most
                    important contribution is its emphasis on the significance of the <hi rend="i"
                        >process</hi> and the <hi rend="i">act</hi> of migrating. Consequently,
                    African Americans are depicted here as conscious and deliberate, if not
                    empowered, actors who made critical decisions about their own futures.</p>
                <p>The book&apos;s secondary goal is to examine the impact of the politics of race
                    and emancipation in the Upper Midwest. The author contends that whites inflated
                    and exaggerated the scale of black migration and its associated
                    dangers—amplifying and intensifying anti-black sentiment to the point of
                    near-hysteria. Whites in the region feared that African Americans&apos; physical
                    mobility would lead to their social mobility, and they fiercely resisted both.
                    Moreover, the climate led midwestern whites to interpret the federal
                    government&apos;s gestures to integrate African Americans more fully into the
                    body politic and society as evidence that the government favored African
                    Americans at their own expense. Midwestern whites also feared that freed people
                    would take their jobs and usurp white political prerogatives. They responded to
                    this perceived threat to their status and whiteness with a cache of political
                    weapons and imagery designed to vigorously defend white supremacy. For example,
                    they erected and enforced segregation laws and practices, idealized gender
                    roles, attempted to control public spaces, and demanded that certain jobs
                    exclude African Americans (p. 105). Schwalm contends that anti-black rhetoric
                    and action extended beyond the political and public arenas, manifesting
                    themselves in everyday life—including mass meetings, associational life,
                    households, and private correspondence (p. 84).</p>
                <pb n="417" id="VAA4025-106-4-101"/>
                <p>The second half of the book focuses on the lives that African Americans crafted
                    in the region after emancipation and migration. Chapter Four outlines how
                    African Americans articulated and justified demands for full freedom and
                    citizenship. Schwalm contends that men and women &quot;experienced their
                    participation...in ways that that included the subjectively symbolic, material,
                    relational, and physical meanings of gender&quot; (p. 107). In fact, her
                    analysis of the construction and meanings of gender is a real strength of this
                    work. Chapter Five delves deep inside the institutional lives of African
                    Americans, emphasizing the significance of fraternal and sororal associations in
                    defining, shaping, pursuing, and defending freedom and citizenship—and in
                    shaping gender roles. Perhaps the most innovative part of <hi rend="i"
                        >Emancipation&apos;s Diaspora</hi> is Chapter Seven, which examines how
                    African Americans publicly commemorated their collective memory of slavery.
                    Emancipation Day celebrations provide the predominant lens for this inquiry, but
                    the author also relies on pension claims, death notices, and postbellum slave
                    narratives to enhance her argument. According to Schwalm, the historical record
                    proves that acknowledging slavery and its trauma was a critical aspect of
                    African Americans&apos; collective identity and of their post-war activism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="i">Emancipation&apos;s Diaspora</hi> follows the unlikely and uncharted
                    path of African Americans&apos; Civil War migration into a region not typically
                    associated with African American history. This book persuasively demonstrates
                    that historians would be remiss to ignore the consequences of emancipation and
                    its subsequent diaspora in regions outside of the slave South—specifically, the
                    Upper Midwest.</p>

                <p>In his 1937 novel <hi rend="i">Black Boy</hi>, Richard Wright reflected,
                    &quot;The things which influenced my conduct as a Negro did not have to happen
                    to me directly; I needed but to hear of them to feel their full effects.&quot;
                    Yet lynching was not performed solely to influence the behavior of African
                    Americans. Amy Louise Wood argues that lynching was carried out for the
                    instruction of<pb n="418" id="VAA4025-106-4-102"/> its white audience as much as for its
                    black one. The brutal practice was used to bind whites together as a unified
                    group in spite of class, gender, and religious differences. Wood claims that
                    &quot;the cultural power of lynching—indeed, the cultural power of white
                    supremacy itself—rested on spectacle&quot; (p. 3). This is a study of how
                    lynching drew on a culture of spectacles—public executions, religious
                    ceremonies, theater, photography, and cinema—to reinforce white supremacy, and
                    ultimately how critics utilized that spectacle to turn public opinion against
                    the practice.</p>
                <p>Organized chronologically and thematically, the book analyzes three broad
                    elements of lynching: its dependence on sensationalism, the relationship between
                    the local and the national, and the practice&apos;s connection to modernity. No
                    spectacle better exemplified the turn-of-the-century contest between local and
                    state power than public executions. When the state deemed private executions
                    more civilized, lynch mobs reclaimed local authority but &quot;saw themselves as
                    extensions of the state&quot; (p. 46). White mobs likewise used religious
                    ceremonies to justify their actions and to demonstrate that they were rational,
                    modern, and civilized.</p>
                <p>In an insightful discussion of lynching photography and early cinema, Wood
                    examines the capacity of modern technology to uphold anti-modern forms of social
                    power. Wood deftly utilizes visual theory without losing sight of how locals
                    perceived and circulated the images. Her analysis makes many familiar images
                    newly appalling to the reader. With thorough attention to the importance of
                    gender, Wood demonstrates that photos made lynching &quot;safe&quot; for a white
                    audience by freezing the body in time and place.</p>
                <p>The spectacle of lynching eventually led to its demise. Images circulated by the
                    NAACP and films such as MGM&apos;s <hi rend="i">Fury</hi> (1936) shifted the
                    emphasis from the broken black body to the mob itself. Gleeful white mobs
                    demonstrated that lynching was irrational, antimodern, and antithetical to
                    American ideals. Some critiques were effective because the victims, such as two
                    men killed in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014457"
                            reg="San Jose">San Jose</settlement></placeName> in 1933, were white.
                    Southern newspaper editors, fearing an economic backlash, could thus adopt
                    anti-lynching rhetoric without feeling attacked as a region. By World War II,
                    critics had created the national perception that law and order were the real
                    victims of the practice. Whites could turn against lynching without abandoning
                    their white supremacist ideals.</p>
                <p>Wood focuses primarily on the lynching of African American men in the modernizing
                            South—<placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007248" reg="Georgia"

                    strengths is the interplay between local and national contexts. Although it is
                    difficult to understand how viewers received films and images, Wood is careful
                    to focus on what can be known: the words of local critics; the intentions <pb
                        n="419" id="VAA4025-106-4-103"/> of filmmakers; which films theater owners
                    chose to screen in particular locations; and which photographs news editors
                    chose to publish. Yet the relationship between reality and representation is not
                    always clear. Did viewers ever doubt the authenticity of photographs as they
                    became technologically savvy and more accustomed to cinematic productions?
                    Continued research on the reception of such spectacles would be welcome. <hi

                    culture and theory can enhance historical research without obscuring the
                    argument. This work is recommended for historians interested in how race and
                    violence worked together to shape popular culture, and vice versa.</p>

                <p>Cecelia Tichi&apos;s new book on the Progressive Era exhorts the reader to
                    reconsider Progressive passions and accomplishments through narrative accounts
                    of seven noted Progressive leaders: Alice Hamilton, John R. Commons, Julia
                    Lathrop, Florence Kelley, Louis D. Brandeis, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Ida B.
                    Wells-Barnett. Tichi&apos;s purpose is to rouse current civic passions by
                    drawing parallels between the concerns of the often quaint-seeming Progressive
                    reformers of the turn of the century and the glaring flaws and corruption of our
                    own polities. Central to this exercise is the vibrant concept of the public good
                    that each of these reformers held up as a beacon in their often exhausting and
                    risky work as public intellectuals and activists.</p>
                <p>Tichi&apos;s book is beautifully written and each chapter succeeds in gripping
                    readers by plunging them into the middle of the subject&apos;s stream of life,
                    generally at a pivotal moment in his or her career. Tichi begins her account of
                    Alice Hamilton&apos;s career as a pathbreaking industrial toxicologist with her
                    confrontation of Edward Cornish, vice president of the National Lead Company,
                    over the poisoning of workers in his plants. She catches the labor economist
                    John R. Commons on a train platform with some of his students as they embark for
                            <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh"

                    laborers and their families.</p>
                <p>Ida B. Wells-Barnett brings up the rear in this parade of research-oriented
                    superstars, and the jaded reader might initially see her as the <pb n="420"

                    But Tichi makes her purpose clear when near the end of the chapter she points
                    out the blind spot toward racial discrimination and harassment shared by
                    virtually all her white reformers except, perhaps, Florence Kelley.</p>

                <p>Tichi concludes the work with a bristling and effective rundown of the civic
                    offenses of private corporations, communication empires, and financial
                    institutions in the period after 2000. She points out that the past resonates in
                    the present, as &quot;private&quot; succeeds &quot;public&quot; as a term of
                    praise in recommending any scheme of reform or philanthropy.</p>
                <p>This is a good book. This reviewer will consider it for use in her undergraduate
                    course on the period from 1900 to 1940. For someone who agrees with the basic
                    analysis and political ideology Tichi lays out, it is tempting to let her do
                    that work with today&apos;s undergraduates. There are pitfalls, of course, for
                    historians in using works that pull no ideological punches and work on the
                    individual heroism model of social change—though here there is certainly an
                    underlying social structural analysis.</p>
                <p>This reviewer also must note, alas, that it was not hard for her to discover the
                    bibliography&apos;s less than encyclopedic reach, since two of her own works
                    were omitted from the core listings: an analytic history of the settlement
                    movement (represented here by Allen Davis&apos;s wonderful but even older <hi
                        rend="i">Spearheads for Reform</hi>) and a detailed biographical article on
                    Agnes Hamilton, cousin of Alice Hamilton, and their shared passion for social
                    change through settlement house activism. That one was published in this very
                    magazine, in fact. A spot check of other obvious titles found them all. If this
                    reviewer were prone to paranoia, she would have good grounds here—but instead
                    she chooses to take these lacunae as a humbling reminder of the fleeting nature
                    of even academic notoriety.</p>

                <p>According to Marshall Chess, &quot;a record man did everything. He found the
                    artist, he produced the record, he promoted it, he sold it with the
                    distributors.&quot; Ordering records, pressing and printing labels, collecting
                    money from juke box companies, radio stations, and music stores, &quot;it was
                    all part of the job.&quot; (p. 117).</p>
                <p>Through their small, independent companies, many of these men (and a few women)
                    became rhythm &amp; blues and rock &apos;n&apos; roll pioneers in the 1940s and
                    &apos;50s. In <hi rend="i">Record Makers and Breakers</hi>, John Broven, a
                    freelance writer with a longstanding interest in popular music, tells their
                    stories. Based on one hundred interviews with key players in the industry, the
                    book celebrates its subjects for &quot;giving opportunities for almost every
                    artist of any merit&quot; and becoming &quot;inadvertent social innovators by
                    igniting a lasting cultural reformation&quot; (p. 470).</p>
                <p>A narrative history, <hi rend="i">Record Makers and Breakers</hi> is often
                    uncritical and only lightly analytical. Broven does not set the context, for
                    example, to evaluate comments about the exploitation of African American artists
                    by &quot;indies&quot; owners, who often insisted on songwriting credits and
                    underpaid royalties. He does not follow up on the assertion of one record man
                    that performers were not really cheated because distributors worked hard to get
                    the music on the air. And Broven&apos;s chapter-long discussion of payola, which
                    he labels (and seems to excuse as) &quot;an integral part of the fabric of
                    capitalist society, no matter what industry, being especially rife in
                    politics&quot; (p. 459), sheds no new light on the practice.</p>
                <p>Although Broven did not &quot;cross-examine&quot; his subjects on controversial
                    issues, he has made a useful contribution to the scholarship of American popular
                    music by conducting—and making available—his interviews with so many industry
                    professionals. Broven talked to the usual suspects: Jerry Wexler and Ahmet
                    Ertegun of Atlantic Records; Art Rupe of Specialty Records; Joe Bihari of Modern
                    Records; and Sam Phillips of Sun Records. His conversations with little or
                    lesser-known owners of &quot;indies,&quot; however, provide new on-the-ground
                    details about the business, which was often operated on a shoe string. Abraham
                    &quot;Pop&quot; Cohen, the owner of Essex distributors in <placeName><region

                        Jersey</region></placeName>, employed his sons Irv and Joe as front men, had
                    a nose for spotting potential bad debts as well as hit records, and relied on a
                    unique form of payola: &quot;Mom&quot; Cohen&apos;s &quot;cakes, knishes,
                    strudels and blintzes&quot; (p. 218). Cosimo Matassa ran the J&amp;M Recording
                    Studio in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014214" reg="New Orleans"
                            >New Orleans</settlement></placeName> as <pb n="422"
                        id="VAA4025-106-4-106"/> part of a family-run operation that included the
                    sale of kitchen and bathroom appliances. Although his facilities, as Matassa put
                    it, were put together with &quot;spit and wire&quot; (p. 181), J&amp;M became
                    the go-to destination of anyone interested in Fats Domino.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of the payola scandals, Broven reminds us, the &quot;record
                    men-disc jockey-distributor network was crumbling&quot; (p. 460). As the British
                    Invasion made it clear that rock &apos;n&apos; roll was here to stay (and pay),
                    the major labels intensified their efforts to gobble up star performers and more
                    than a few of the &quot;indies&quot; themselves. The &quot;merry band of
                    mavericks,&quot; Broven concludes, with the nostalgia that permeates his book,
                    was reined in by &quot;natural economic forces and technological
                    revolution.&quot; Once wide-open record markets had matured, as markets
                    &quot;always do.&quot; And &quot;the energetic excitement&quot; drained,
                    &quot;as it always does&quot; (p. 470).</p>

                <p>&quot;Are you an activist yourself? Do you believe in the practical approach to
                    resolving human problems?&quot; This advertisement appeared in a May 1976 issue
                    of the newspaper <hi rend="i">Peoples Forum</hi>. As a longtime chronicler and
                    analyst of Jim Jones, Jonestown, and the Peoples Temple, Rebecca Moore has built
                    a career out of interpreting the pragmatic appeal of such promotions. Much of
                    her explanatory narrative agrees with novelist Shiva Naipaul&apos;s assessment
                    that &quot;Jim Jones built his movement on the debris of the Sixties; on its
                    frustrations, failures, and apostasies&quot; (p. 22). At its height, Peoples
                    Temple boasted a membership of 20,000, but it never represented a
                    demographically significant trend in American religion. Rather, due to its
                    tragic conclusion, Peoples Temple—and, colloquially, its poisoned Kool-Aid—has
                    become a metonym for brainwashing and blind obedience. Through Moore&apos;s
                    scholarly stewardship, Peoples Temple and Jonestown become instead
                    quintessentially American. As she writes, &quot;Peoples Temple was a homegrown
                    religion and, at its heart, reflected American institutions&quot; (p. 6). From
                    its beginnings, the church of Jim Jones embodied patterns in <placeName><country

                    took root in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                    for its Pentecostal-style healing services and interracial congregation. Moore
                    tracks Jones on the long religious journey that took him as a young man through
                    Methodist, Nazarene, Pentecostal, and Quaker meetings in the 1930s and 1940s;
                    then, as an entrepreneurial pastor, on scouting trips in the 1950s to see Father
                    Divine&apos;s Peace Mission movement; and, as an emerging prophet, on missionary
                    explorations to <placeName><country key="tgn_7004624" reg="Cuba"

                    1960s. Like the Peace Mission movement he so admired, Jones&apos;s Peoples
                    Temple became as well known for its free food and social services as it did for
                    his passionate sermons. This Social Gospel impulse attracted working-class
                    whites and blacks seeking immediate response to the grotesque inequalities of
                    capitalism. &quot;Social justice,&quot; Moore writes, &quot;became an important
                    and perhaps central element of Peoples Temple&apos;s theology&quot; (p. 27).</p>
                <p>Part reportage and part critical historiography, Moore&apos;s account moves

                            >California</region></placeName> in 1965, she expands her analysis to
                    include the social context of the Bay area and the contemporaneous political
                    projects to which Jones committed as a civic figure. When the Temple relocated
                    again from <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007157" reg="California"

                    sifts and considers a variety of positions to achieve a redacted account. Was
                    their migration to <placeName><country key="tgn_1000054" reg="Guyana"
                            >Guyana</country></placeName> prompted by a fear that the IRS would
                    freeze the Temple&apos;s assets? Or was it worries over child custody battles?
                    Or was it because the community became convinced by Jones&apos;s argument that a
                    fascist takeover was imminent in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                        reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>? Moore draws no neat
                    conclusions. Instead, Chapters Four, Five, and Six supply an elegant appraisal
                    of the sociologies, psychologies, and theologies that concluded in the November
                    1978 suicide of 900 Jonestown occupants. With analysis of external and internal
                    forces, Moore&apos;s description builds into a devastating symphony of irritants
                    (government investigations, news reporters) and aggravations (defecting leaders,
                    material circumstances, psychical terror). In the year leading up to it, there
                    had been a half-dozen such &quot;White Nights,&quot; or ritual occasions in
                    which people were led to believe by Jones that they were threatened, and that
                    there was only one way to preserve their dream. Through Moore&apos;s judicious
                    rendering, the story of Peoples Temple is no longer mere madness. Instead, it
                    appears as a utopian journey whose catastrophic millennialism belies its
                    midwestern origins, as well as its optimistic advertisements of progress,
                    communal labor, and real equality.</p>

                <p>Robert Churchill attempts something daring in <hi rend="i">To Shake Their Guns in
                        the Tyrant&apos;s Face</hi>. He firmly positions the modern militia
                    movement—widely despised and feared as dangerous and &quot;extremist&quot;—in
                    an American political and intellectual tradition that defined our founding. The
                    book attempts to answer the question that Churchill frames in his introduction:
                    &quot;[H]ow do certain ideas, movements, and political impulses come to be
                    considered extremist?&quot; (p. 3). Churchill understands American history well
                    enough to know—as many of the opinion makers and media appalled by modern
                    militias do not—that &quot;the militias&apos; assertion of a right to use armed
                    force to change government policy&quot; is not something &quot;new, threatening,
                    or beyond the pale of legitimate politics&quot; but rather &quot;achingly
                    familiar,&quot; in the face of what the militia members see as &quot;the
                    exercise of unconstitutional power by the federal government&quot; (p. 3).</p>
                <p>Churchill sees in modern militias the principle that underlay our Declaration of
                    Independence and the Revolutionary War that accompanied it: that citizens have
                    the right and even duty to rise up forcefully against state attempts to violate
                    their rights. In telling the story of the militias&apos; institutions and ideas,
                    Churchill shines a light of understanding, if not approval.</p>
                <p>The stories Churchill tells trace the occasional revival of the American
                    insurrectionist spirit after the Revolutionary era and up to the 1990s. He
                    understands that it is clearly a good thing for peaceful civic order that
                    America is not regularly wracked by political violence. He tells of Fries&apos;
                    Rebellion (which arose from the Alien and Sedition Act controversies of
                    1798-99); the Sons of Liberty insurrection against Lincoln&apos;s government in
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName> in 1863-64; and the &quot;Black
                    Legion&quot; that arose in the Midwest in opposition to Roosevelt&apos;s
                    policies in 1936. None of these groups, no matter how much one might approve (or
                    disapprove) of their specific grievances, has a particularly noble story to tell
                    for themselves.</p>
                <p>Churchill also puts forth a broader view of the evolution of Americans&apos;
                    implicit political philosophy: we have lost, he says, the <pb n="425"
                        id="VAA4025-106-4-109"/> notion that the government could ever violate its
                    citizens&apos; liberties to such an extent that sitting back and taking it is
                    not the preferred response. Loyalty to the nation has almost entirely superseded
                    loyalty to its constitutional principles of limited government.</p>
                <p>And that is exactly how most Americans want it. Churchill cannot come up with a
                    singular convincing answer as to <hi rend="i">why</hi> our regnant political
                    ideology has so shifted, but neither has anyone else. Complicated shifts in our
                    national political and intellectual history, together with changes in both
                    circumstances and ideas, have created a society in which, as Churchill writes,
                    we have &quot;a new patriotic identity based on loyalty, obedience, and a state
                    monopoly on violence&quot; (p. 22).</p>
                <p>In the face of an intellectual and political status quo that writes off
                            <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                            >America</country></placeName>&apos;s founding intellectual tradition as
                    dangerously extremist, Churchill has performed a signal service in documenting
                    that the concept of legitimate political violence has a long historical
                    tradition in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                            >America</country></placeName>, and that even a movement as despised as
                    the modern militia raises valuable questions about civic responsibility in the
                    face of unconstitutional, even tyrannical, state behavior.</p>
                <p>The Second Amendment was recently revived for the purposes of personal defense in
                    the 2008 <hi rend="i">Heller</hi> case. Churchill reminds us that it had a
                    larger civic purpose that we have chosen to forget, and that those who refer to
                    that purpose are not necessarily motivated merely by racial or class-based
                    animus and madness.</p>

                <p>While evident in the nature of its name but often lost amongst other strands of

                        >Indiana</region></placeName> was and still is, thanks in part to Elizabeth Glenn and
                    Stewart Rafert&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Native Americans</hi>, &quot;The Land of
                    the Indians.&quot; In the first centuries of white colonization, the land
                    existed beyond the conscious thought of most Europeans, although trading routes
                    passed along many of its rivers. The Delaware, the Miami, and the Potawatomi, to
                    name only a few tribes, lived in relative isolation and, for the most part, in
                    relative peace.</p>
                <p>The War of 1812 and the needs of a burgeoning nation changed everything. Keenly
                    aware of the vast resources that resided on the other side of the mountains,
                    white settlers began to pour into this land of the Indians. By the middle of the
                    nineteenth century, the land had become another tragic locale for the removal of
                    many of its original occupants. While most historians may be tempted to stop at
                    this point of removal, Glenn (professor emerita of anthropology at Ball State
                    University) and Rafert (adjunct professor of history at the University of
                    Delaware and author of <hi rend="i">The Miami Indians of Indiana</hi>) press on
                    to the present day.</p>
                <p>Glenn and Rafert lead us through a chronological discussion of the history of the
                    peoples who once and, in some cases, still do occupy this land. Beginning with
                    &quot;Original Ethnic Groups&quot; reaching as far back as 11,500 years, the
                    authors detail the lifestyles, cultural values, and societal structures of the
                    inhabitants of what became <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The authors proceed to show the various
                    legal and cultural struggles that tribal peoples in <placeName><region
                        type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, particularly the
                    Miami and the Potawatomi, had to navigate. Each chapter focuses on a period of
                    time lasting two to four decades, in effect telling the stories of the tribes in
                    generational eras. This structure allows the authors to highlight key
                    individuals and events that give a local quality to this history.</p>
                <p>As an historical treatise, Glenn and Rafert&apos;s work comes with both strengths
                    and weaknesses. One of the strengths is the gripping, informative writing style
                    that allows the authors <pb n="427" id="VAA4025-106-4-111"/> to offer a concise
                    introduction to the story of tribal peoples in <placeName><region type="state"
                        key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The book is accessible
                    to lay readers, whether they are college students, high school students, or
                    interested individuals thoroughly removed from any connection to
                    <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> or its
                    tribal peoples.</p>
                <p>However, some critical concerns do emerge. The concluding section of the book
                    leads away from a discussion of tribal peoples in <placeName><region
                            type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                        >Indiana</region></placeName>, describing instead a more general view of
                    tribal peoples in <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                            >America</country></placeName>. Another weakness is the brief nature of
                    some of the information offered concise writing makes for engaging reading but
                    it can also sacrifice depth, for example, in descriptions of important
                    historical figures including Chief Pokagon and Chief Little Turtle.</p>
                <p>Together, we initially read this book as part of a college class focused not only
                    on the history of tribal peoples but also on the relationships we now share with
                    them as fellow members of the social fabric currently defining
                            <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                            >Indiana</region></placeName>. We wanted to know more about the past,
                    present, and future of tribal peoples here in <placeName><region type="state"
                        key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. A number of good books
                    exist concerning particular tribal groups. However, no singular text deals
                    directly with the lives of these peoples within the particular geographical
                    boundaries that now define <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. We found this book to be capable of filling
                    that void.</p>
                <p>In general, our responses to this book as teacher and students were quite
                    comparable. We met each week over the course of a six-week period to discuss the
                    material found in each chapter along with matters such source utilization and
                    historiographical commitments. As previously mentioned, we determined that the
                    book possessed certain weaknesses. However, we also found that high school or
                    college classes with comparable interests would be well served by this text.
                    Individuals with interests in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> or midwestern history would also be well
                    served.</p>
                <p>Overall, Glenn and Rafert present a strong assessment of the significance of
                    tribal peoples in the story of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                        reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The chronological structure of the book
                    ensures easy access for a wide range of readers, and the authors provide a
                    lengthy list of primary and secondary sources. The story told by Glenn and
                    Rafert reminds us in a convincing manner that before <placeName><region
                        type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, before the idea of
                    a land of borders and fences, free peoples called this land home and that those
                    peoples underwent a transformation that almost destroyed their story.</p>
